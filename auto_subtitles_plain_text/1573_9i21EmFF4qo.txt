 hey guys Christian pot that come look what we've got here today mussels mussels yeah look who we got here we got India with my sous-chef helping me today yeah mussels ma'am I love curry but mussels I'm not a fan of that trust me we're gonna be making a nice career you're gonna be licking your lips when we're done go give me that kind of finish my little find out hahaha yeah guys so we got the mussels and we've got some nice coconut milk there and some lovely curry powder out of the Caribbean Caribbean sunshine scotch bonnet pepper we're doing a lovely coconut curried muscle so as we've done in the past one we're making curry dishes we're going to start off with a nice big wide pan and I'm gonna go in and right now it's on a medium a medium heat I'm going to go in with some olive oil and since the pan is relatively warm already we're going to go in with some onions as well as some garlic and all of the ingredients we use here today will be mentioned value description of the video as well as you can also check out Caribbean pot comm for this recipe we'll turn my heat down to low now hold that around and the reason why you want it on low is because you want to bring up a lot of the flavor from that onion and garlic so you have a nice rich curry base but without burning it so nice and slow let that go for about three minutes next up we're going to go in with some lovely curry powder that's not the way para my desert how come you're doing it like that well you know what grandma usually makes what she's called a slurry so she would mix up curry powder and water and then toss it in here what we're doing here is we're just going to toast this curry again low heat when the garlic and onion we want to toast all those spices that make up the curry powder to really release all those flavors next up we're going to run with some fresh ground black pepper just to weaken up that black pepper as well I've got some chopped up shadow Benny here if you can get shot of any by the way if you go to the Hispanic as well as the Asian grocery stores it may be called cue lunch or not cilantro but culantro but cilantro is also a good substitute that's gonna toast up as well and indoors some of that lovely scotch bonnet pepper no seeds I just want to awaken this up a little bit no seeds because that seed is where most of that heat is going to be that's going to give that about half of a minute before we get going next up we're going to go in with the the mussel and here's the thing mussels is not something you'd normally find being cooked in the Caribbean and on a regular basis Shore maybe people to defense your restaurants and stuff you would get it there so this here is pretty much my interpretation of how we would do mussels if we were doing mussels in the Caribbean I'm just going to go ahead and really want to mix that up turn your heat up to high now because you want to bring that up to a high temperature right away I'm going to go in with a bit of sea salt one chopped up tomato diced up finely the coconut milk and what you could also do is after you made that curry base you can add the coconut milk to there so that coconut milk will sort of combine and cook down with that curry first but I'm just doing things a little bit different here and totally optional ingredient I've got some good old carbs some beer out of the Caribbean that's going to go in there with some of that move that around a little bit bring that up to a boil mix oh that's scent from that curry as well at that beer of your eyes and you can mention Chris typically you would find mussels being cooked with garlic and white wine but this coconut curry with a little bit of beer right this is insanely bring that up to a boil we're going to put that lid on there and let that go for about anywhere from five to eight minutes you're looking for all those muscles to open up and then you're good to do it's been about six minutes they're all open up you're getting a lovely rich curry sound good the coconut carbon look into these that's pretty much it what you're looking for is to make sure they're all open notice how they're all opened up here all that lovely muscle meat is in there mmm final step before turning the heat off add a nice piece of lemon here just going to cup it over my hands so any of the seeds will go in there just to brighten this up a little bit some of that lemon juice in there we're going to go in with some chopped parsley turn your heat off and I mean to see if that's it there you go guys curry coconut well coconut curry mussels we got some tots from India what do you think it looks amazing and it looks like something I would try but I'm still one for my curry chicken the girl legacy curry chicken what I like what am I supposed to say about that but here we go guys coconut curry mussels with a little bit of lager that little bit of beer um in under 10 minutes you have a wonderful dish here all you're gonna do and got that nice juicy gravy down on the bottom there bread coconut bread I mean it's even got some hot Oh bread from Jamaica you're good to go dip in there and dig in my crisps a Caribbean pod calm we
