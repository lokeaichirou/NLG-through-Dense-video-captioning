 in this video I'm going to show you how to make California roll to make the filling what you're going to need is some crabs mascarpone so Mayo and some aromatic noir now this is optional it's not really necessary but it does give that a little extra touch now I don't know where you get this this is from a Dutch shop that's him locally so I'll try to find on the internet if I do I'll put it on my store and make sure store I don't probably anything that you start off by cutting the crab sticks up now the finely chopped up we put them up into a bowl okay we add a spoon of mascarpone cheese which is basically a Italian cream cheese a small spoon unnecessary to put much and about a spoon of mayonnaise just do it with the eye now you add a couple of shakes of camor and mix it where the fall by wetting your hands and then spreading out the 150 grams of cooked sushi rice over half a sheet of nori now don't mush the rice down don't press it down too hard just fluff it out slightly okay then we add some seasoned seeds over it and now we just place it upside down onto a rolling mat inside a plastic bag now what you want to do is you want to add the crab filling which we made earlier okay go we are two peas a cucumber and some avocados okay now we're ready to roll you bring it over and then keeping all the contents inside you curl it in all right so you could in applying pressure and closing it leaving a little lip at the bottom now do you just bring it over and then compress again so it closes the lip and I wanna do that again just get the right formation and roll the roll up just one more time just get the right shape that looks about right now what you can do is you can press the edges in I like to cut mine off just to make it neater now to get a clean cut I would suggest adding some cling film at least for the inside-out rolls and you just touch the cling film to it and now you take your sharpest knife you have dip it in some water so the rice and stick to it I suggest cut off okay and this one and then we cut it in half half again okay penny in and do more times okay shape the roll back up make a cling film off discard little end pieces that cut off and voila one California or eight pieces you
