 this is a confirmed femme fatale calm today I like to share with you the art of making the perfect bunny sandwich but we are getting very popular in the US and you'll find bunny shops everywhere in the Bay Area and I've seen a lot of them in New York and I'm going to show you how easy it is to assemble at home so let's start today I'm gonna make the filling with Vietnamese meatballs it's called assumed isaak/sakai and here it is it's still warm and it smells very good we'll need a baguette I bought it but you know if you want to make it at home you can follow the recipe on my cookbook it's aptly called bed meat and here's what we're gonna make today is the people filling today we're gonna need the signature element of the binary which is pickled daikon and carrots so we're gonna need the daikon first here's how it looks like if you don't have the icon and you can use like a substitute you could use radishes but or just care and we're gonna peel it first there you go get an eye yeah you go make the long ribbon like slices of the radish I think that's enough but God just with the same thing with carrots got carrots and here's I care that by the Margay was so cute staying there do you sign but anyways so you don't want the carrot peels to be too thin because you'll lose some of the crunchiness of the carrot so I use a you know like fairly hot thick peeler so let's do the same with the carrots so the daikon in the carrots are just a substitute of the French Bonjour in the traditional jumbled jumbled bell sandwich and basically the it's because the the French pickles were so expensive that Vietnamese people try to find ingredients that they could that were available inland and just to make them taste as closely as possible as the costly French products so it's not that complicated to just cut into space all you have to do is use your knife as a leverage you point to the tip of the knife and there's and just like do that like motion back and forth and you'll have those like thin string in no time so I'm gonna get the same thing with the daikon let me show you a close-up so you can see it better let me get the carrots out okay I'm gonna get it all put all the carrots and the daikon together let's move this cutting board over here you can add a little white vinegar or lemon juice I would usually put white onion but this version decided not to go with the onions because I'm gonna add a little bit of mint and bean sprout instead let's add the sugar and mix it together the other element of a bun Mesa which is the butter so try to use a quality butter and Vietnam the most sought out and ingredient is the bell potent which is the butter from Brittany so I got awesome European Irish butter but you know anything could work it's really yellow and I just put it to a lunatic this it is easy to spread I got a baguette I'm gonna remove some inside so we can put a lot of the other filling inside we just spread a little bit of butter see and then spread it and one side the other side we're gonna use mailings I just made it and it's still getting like a little thick so I'm gonna thin it with more line you want something that is very refreshing in the line really brings that bright taste to the condiment I'm gonna spread the Mayo on the other side we have some mint so this is Vietnamese mint you know the the veins are a lot deeper than the regular mint and I planted it myself but you can find spearmint at the Asian grocery store or just use regular mint and I'm gonna use cilantro so I'm gonna tear the knees if you decide to cut them it will bruise the leaves and they'll darken a lot faster so let's do this the pickled carrots are ready they're gonna be crunchy and very tasty I added a little bean sprout for extra crunch we're gonna add the meatballs look how delicious they look and then add just to get your element with the carrots and pickle daikon you're gonna add a little bit of and close a sandwich the last thing is to add a little drizzle of Maji which is holstered soy sauce you can find it in many Asian grocery store it's a little pricey this one was $20 a bottle but if you don't have it you can add just regular soy sauce but this is such a pretty expensive product because it's imported from France but you don't have to use much and you can use soy sauce so it added a little saltiness to the bread there you go my sandwich is ready it's so yummy the meatball is very soft and the crunchiness from the carrot I'm convinced Brown add that marvelous texture to the sandwich so see how it is to assemble I hope you liked the video if you want to see more recipes of the but me you can buy my book on Amazon and I'm in Barnes &amp;
