 hey if you like Korean food then you're gonna want to check out this pagoda recipe that I have for you the ingredients are shown on the screen there's not a lot but by the time you're done you're gonna have a nice tender juicy the Gobi to eat first let's prepare three or four cloves of garlic then let's cut an onion in half and chop it up now let's also cut up three stalks of scallions and set them aside as well now get a large mixing bowl first thing you want to do a quarter cup of soy sauce now add two tablespoons of sesame oil add 1 tablespoon of now let's also add two tablespoons of honey add 1 tablespoon of roasted sesame seeds and the final ingredient in our marinade is a quarter teaspoon of red pepper powder you will barely taste this now mix everything very well in the bowl has put those onions in from earlier and also the garlic and the scallions as well next we add the beef it's important to pick the right beef stuff so we pick the thinly sliced kind and the kind that has a little bit fat in it this isn't the healthiest choice but after you cook it it'll be less dry and then being really tasty all right now it's time to mix everything together so either put up some gloves or don't but just mix everything very well and evenly if it looks a little dry don't worry about it by the time it it's ready to cook again we even marinated it from one to five hours or overnight for our even better results all right let's cover this up and let it marinate in our video the neat sat for two or three hours before okay so we're doing this at the table I think it's a Korean thing but you know they really like to cook their meat and foods at the table and eat it while it's fresh and hot the thing you want to be aware of is that you don't want to overcrowd the hot pan or whatever use we don't have a proper Korean barbecue real soldiers using but yeah you don't want to overcrowd it because if you do it may not cook or char as well and I get Steve means that have you know mr. fry so you can do this too but as you can see we have vegetables at the table we actually used half the grill to cook the vegetables and the other half to cook the meat the vegetables don't need any seasoning at all because the juices and flavor from the meat will be wonderfully absorbed in the vegetable and it's gonna help out excellent okay get a bowl of rice and as the Koreans do directly transfer the cooked food you thanks for watching be sure to keep watching because I'm going to have some additional features to share with you guys I'd appreciate it if you guys would subscribe and give a thumbs up if you like these videos thanks
