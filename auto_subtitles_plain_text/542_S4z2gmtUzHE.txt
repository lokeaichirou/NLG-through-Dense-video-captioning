 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with drunken mussels that's right I like my shellfish like I like my sellers and this is one of the easiest shellfish recipes ever and once you have your ingredients together this thing takes about ten minutes start to finish so here's how you do it the first and most important ingredient of course is the mussels these are from Prince Edward Island you'll see them in a seafood case it'll say PEI they should be incredibly fresh they need to be scrubbed really well and rinsed off and if you see any of those little beards attached pull it off mine really didn't have any and we're pretty clean and as far as portioning I usually go with like about a pound of mussels per person all right so our mussels are set onto the rest of the ingredients so I'm gonna need you to mince up some garlic you can use regular garlic but you know what I found some green garlic in the market and I decided to use that so just like using green onions I'm pretty much gonna use the white and light parts and I'm gonna mince it up nice and fine and again don't feel bad if you don't find green garlic regular garlic works extraordinarily well and is incredibly delicious so don't even worry about it okay this is one of those recipes it's super easy but you need to get all your ingredients prepped ahead of time which is called of course mise and pause okay so our garlic's ready we're gonna set that aside next we're gonna do some Italian parsley and you know my method for this you hold the stems you hold your knife sharp knife at a 45 degree angle and you just shave off all the leaves so easy do not pick parsley leaves off the stems takes too long alright and once we've done that we just give it a chop not too fine alright something like that and other than a little bit of lemon zest and red pepper flakes that's about it all right so we're gonna head over to the stove where you need a stockpot like this with a tight-fitting lid all right very very important so make sure you have that before you even think of starting this recipe we're gonna throw in a chunk of butter I'm gonna put that on medium heat and once it melts we're gonna add our garlic we're gonna give that about a 30-second sizzle after which I'm gonna add my red pepper flakes I like this a little bit spicy but you know I like most things a little bit spicy so I'm gonna add a big pinch of those give that about 15 seconds in the butter at that point I'm gonna add my lemon zest I used a zester to get those nice thin strands you could also grade it on the microplane you've seen us do both many times so the lemon zest goes in you give that about 30 seconds and then quickly pouring your wine okay the wine stops the cooking we do not want to burn or brown the garlic so that whole process of sauteing the garlic the pepper and the lemon zest only took about a minute once the wines in I give it a few turns of freshly ground black pepper you generally don't need salt the mussels have enough natural salts so be careful when seasoning and at that point our drunken mussel broth is ready we're gonna place on the lid we're gonna turn the heat to high and we're gonna bring this to a boil as soon as it boils you're gonna quickly throw in your mussels don't throw any of the ice in if you had them sitting in water or something like that you want to drain it you just want the mussels you're gonna quickly place the lid back on and by the way I'm so glad I wore a shirt for this video generally I cook topless all right so the lids on we're gonna give the pot the old shake of sheikha and let it sit there undisturbed for exactly one minute after one minute remove the lid take a spoon and give it a quick stir just like that couple turns place the lid back on and wait two minutes after which you should be getting close you're gonna see lots of the shells opening in fact back right you can actually see it opening so cool at that point we're gonna dump in our Italian parsley give it another stir put the lid back on and as soon as those shells are open you're done it might take another minute it might take another two minutes it could take possibly one-and-a-half minutes or three minutes the point is who knows go by sight when it looks like they're all open you're done alright the shells should be open like that the mussel should still be huge implanting gorgeous and not shriveled and pathetic alright the only way to screw this recipe up is to keep boiling these after they open and of course if there's a couple that don't open that's not so unusual just throw those away and deal with the good ones okay to serve you're gonna want to transfer those into a big wide Bowl of course you're gonna ladle over copious amounts of that amazing drunken mussel broth I highly suggest you serve it with some lemon and some grilled bread of course if you're having grilled problems I feel bad for your son but you could just use a toaster instead and that's it drunken mussels how fast and easy was that and of course drunken mussels is just a generic term for mussels steamed in any kind of alcoholic beverage I've done this with beer with things like sherry of course you don't have to use alcohol you could use some clam juice or just some water is it as good of course not not even close all right so let me dig in here I'm gonna take my freakishly small metal fork and dip that muscle in that amazing broth garlicky spicy lemony just unbelievable and while dipping the muscle in that broth is pretty awesome nothing compares to how awesome dipping the bread in there is it's just spectacular and if you're feeling extra sexy I like to place it on the bread and drizzle some of that buttery garlicky wine broth over it's just a very special experience that I hope you experience especially so head over to food whooshes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy
