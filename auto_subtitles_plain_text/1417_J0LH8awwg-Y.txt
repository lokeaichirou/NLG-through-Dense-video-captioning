 hey guys is Barrett and welcome to Paris kitchen vid onion rings that's right this is the most amazingly crispy recipe that I've ever tasted and the most astonishing part here is that I've used very basic onion rings ingredients and just week the coating process just a little bit and the results were just amazing all right so here I've already sliced some onions antek in the rings out now while slicing the onions make sure that you don't slice your onion rings more than a quarter of an inch thick otherwise they won't cook properly so I'm gonna transfer the Rings into a bowl and add some ice-cold water and some vinegar we're gonna let the ring sit in the water and vinegar for around 10 minutes and the meanwhile I'm gonna tell you how I'm gonna coat it a little differently than the traditional methods okay so first I want to coat them in some dry ingredients so I've taken some cornstarch and to that I'm gonna add some baking soda and yes it's baking soda and not baking powder we're gonna season it with some salt and some thyme pepper you can definitely add some of the spices of your own choice I mean you can add some garlic powder some paprika or or even onion powder okay maybe not onion powder because it already has an onion then we're just gonna whisk the dry ingredients thoroughly so after ten minutes I'm gonna take my rings out of the water and coat them with the cornstarch mix so just draw a few rings at a time and make sure it coated from all the sides now you don't want to coat them generously just enough such that cornstarch sticks to it so we're gonna let these try coated onion rings to rest for about five minutes over a cooling rack and if you don't have a cooling rack you can keep a butter paper underneath them and they'll be just fine now in cornstarch is added to water it becomes like a gel and that gel when comes into heat becomes really crispy and that my friends will basically introduce the crispy life of these onion rings okay so now for my batter coating I'm gonna take some all-purpose flour some cornstarch and some cornmeal which is also known as corn flour polenta or even mucky cotton in some countries we're gonna add some salt and be careful as we're not gonna be adding any spices in the batter finally we're gonna some ice-cold water and fists get generously now risking is very important as we want to incorporate certain amount of air in this batter so on a mix it for around five minutes and then I'm gonna add some oil and whisk it again for two minutes more now not making a very thick batter but it can make a very thick batter if you like those overly battered onion rings okay so for my crumb coating I wanna use some panko bread crumbs offer best results you have to use panko bread crumbs only but if you don't have panko breadcrumbs you can use normal bread crumbs or you can even go without Brigham's as this recipe is such that even if you make battered onion rings there's still really crispy okay so dip the dry coated onion rings in the batter and enough to latch on to these onion rings such that it's well coated then I wanna wait for excess batter to drip off and then just dunk them in the bread crumbs now for crumb coating I usually add few bread crumbs in a small bowel and just shake it vigorously there's no making your hands dirty or nothing like that and if you look closely you'll notice that the onion rings are quite evenly coated and this is absolutely no mess which means no distress so we're gonna fry the onion rings on a medium flame which is basically standard frying two minutes on one side then flip them in two minutes on the other side now I'm using canola oil you can use any other oil but a high smoke point oil will give you good results so we're gonna fry them until they're golden brown or until they look like this okay so now to finally answer the question that is this stuff amazingly crispy then just hear this so these were the battered one and now for the braided one now most recipes out there are generally crispy for about 15 to 20 minutes after frying but wait till you hear this voice which I recorded modified to 50 minutes after frying so there you go guys how to make crispy onion rings if you liked the video do give it a thumbs up for updates and queries don't forget to like me on Facebook and then I'll see you all next time [Music] you [Music] [Laughter]
