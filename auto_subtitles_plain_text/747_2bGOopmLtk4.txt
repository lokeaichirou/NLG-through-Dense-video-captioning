 hi I'm Miranda Valentine editor of the lifestyle blog everything sounds better in French and today I'm going to show you how to make basic mashed potatoes now this simple side dish is such a classic and such a favorite and as you'll see really really easy to do so I have all of our ingredients laid out here we're starting with one and a half pounds of baking potatoes such as russet or Yukon Gold and they have been washed peeled and quartered I have them right here we're gonna use three to five tablespoons of milk I've used five just because I like my mashed potatoes to be nice and creamy we also have two tablespoons of unsalted butter we have a half of a teaspoon of salt and then just a little pinch of pepper that we're gonna use over here to taste so I've got water in this medium saucepan over here and it's already started to to heat I'm going to add my potatoes right now and then I'm gonna bring them to a boil we're gonna let this boil covered for about 20 to 25 minutes until our potatoes are nice and tender and ready to mash also gonna add our salt and now we're gonna salt the water pop this on and now we're going to let it boil for 20 to 25 minutes and we'll check it you can always do the fork test insert a fork to see if it's tender if it is you know you're ready to go it's been 20 minutes and our potatoes are nice and soft so I've drained them and put them into this bowl because I'm gonna mix everything together so I'm using a potato masher today but you could also use a hand mixer I would caution against ever putting it in a blender or a food processor or even using your hand mixer on too high potatoes are so high in starch that they can actually become like gluey really really quickly you can over process a potato so just keep that in mind so when you're working with a small amount like this I find that a potato masher looks just fine so we're just gonna start and just kind of break it up a little bit of mash mash mash this doesn't have to be perfect yet we're just starting starting the mashing process and now we're gonna add in the butter so let's pop our butter in here and you'll definitely want to make sure that you're doing this you know right after the potatoes have been drained because you know obviously the heat and steam from the potatoes are what is going to melt our butter here and now it's time to add in a little bit more salt and pepper this is to taste you'll remember that we boiled our potatoes using the salted water and so now this is just a taste I happen to like my mashed potatoes with quite a bit of salt but that's different for everyone so you just do however much you like just remember that you could always add more but you can't take any up so maybe don't be too heavy-handed if you're not sure on what your preference is yet and just mix mix mix so it's starting to get nice and light and fluffy so we can add in the milk now a note about milk you want to make sure that you use not cold milk if you can use at least room temperature or warms milk that's better if you use cold milk it will react with the starch and also give you kind of that gluey difficult texture I've learned that the hard way a long time ago so definitely want to use some some warm milk or room-temperature peat pen it's just a little trick to make it a bit easier for you so we're just gonna add it in in sections so I'm just gonna do kind of half right now just drizzle and mash it up and then the remaining a little bit and once you have this recipe down you'll be able to customize it to your you know Herts content you could add in pesto you could do roasted garlic it even add salt into mashed potatoes there are so many things but once you have this recipe down you are good to go there you go creamy delicious the perfect quintessential side dish that's how you make basic mashed potatoes thanks for watching make sure to subscribe and if there's something that you want to learn how to make send me an email at request at Mahalo calm and don't forget to check out our other great videos [Music]
