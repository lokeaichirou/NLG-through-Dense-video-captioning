 and it's so interesting that it's all the trend today and when I was a kid and my mom would take hummus and use that instead of Mayo on our sandwiches and we packed those in our brown bag for lunch and the other kids would ask me what I was eating because it smelled so great I'd be real embarrassed and I'd say Lebanese mayonnaise but you know what we have really come full circle hummus is probably one of the best things you can eat and it's very expensive in the delis or at the grocery I'm going to show you how to make your own an old family recipe that's delicious and really easy you want to start off with the can of chickpeas sometimes called chichi beans garbanzo beans full of calcium any bean is really good helps pull cholesterol out of your body all I do is drain them you don't need to rinse them now you can do this by hand like my mom used to do but I'm going to do it in a food processor because I like it very smooth but you can get smoother as chunky as you want and to that you're going to add a teaspoon of minced garlic oh that smells so good more or less remember this is to your taste now garlic is good for your heart so I made a little more than a teaspoon and 1/4 a cup of lemon juice and you know you can freeze lemons let me tell you a great trick when you buy lemons in the store and if they're ever on sale take your lemon whole unpeeled like this put it in the freezer let freeze it hard uncovered when it's frozen hard you've got a frozen lemon the great thing is thawed out and it will exude so much juice because the cellular structure has broken down in the freezer just like tomatoes and also if you're going to zest that frozen lemon zest it before of course you cut it in half and while it's still fairly frozen but that is a great way to have vitamin C all year round now sometimes when you buy a lemon too at the store they're hard in the old fashioned way - as you roll it roll it roll it on the counter with the palm of your hand to start breaking that cellular structure down if it's still real hard sometimes that doesn't work well what you can do is poke a few holes in it like this take it over to the microwave and microwave it's just a few seconds not long and what happens is the heat of that microwave will again soften the outside and the inside and you'll get lots and lots of juice so that's your lemon primer for today so let's continue to make our hummus you want to use about 1/4 a cup of lemon juice again more or less to taste and now the secret ingredient or really not even a secret the key ingredient in hummus is something called tahini now tahini is nothing more than sesame seed paste when you get it home and you open it store it in the refrigerator and it'll it'll keep for six seven months in there and sesame seeds are full of calcium really really delicious used a lot in Mediterranean cooking so you want to use any we're all about three tablespoons or so and I will tell you that when it's stored in the fridge what happens is the oil of the sesame seeds rises to the top so when you take it out of the fridge stir it up otherwise you're just going to get sesame seed oil and now what we're going to do we're going to add a couple tablespoons of olive oil and you know olive oil is really a healthy oil some people don't even add the olive oil but I like the flavor of it now for my two secret ingredients a little bit of yogurt about 1/4 of a cup use good yogurt that gives it a little bit of a tang to my palates really good and comune we call it commune cumin seed about a teaspoon half a teaspoon a little bit more or less to taste oh I wish you were here that smells so good very warming herb again used a lot in Mediterranean cooking and we're going to give it a grind of salt or pepper and pepper and with Justin here he probably would love cayenne pepper you could do that too I'm just going to show you how quick it is now you know what that is done what I'm going to do now is I'm we're going to pour it in a bowl season it with salt and pepper and we're ready to eat it's only took a couple not even two minutes in the food processor and if you notice mine is chunky but you can make it smooth as you want just by continuing to process it more and some people do this in the blender as well now I say the only downside to hummus is the color because it's sort of brownish so what we're going to do is we're going to gussy it up a little bit with some fresh parsley and sometimes let me do this too at home what I'll do is right before I serve it drizzle it again with some extra-virgin or pure olive oil okay there you go really hummus in a flash you
