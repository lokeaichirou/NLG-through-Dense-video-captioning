 today we're making a bacon grilled cheese here on cooking with bacon here's what it's going to look like pretty rad so I'm going to start with four strips of bacon in the pan and I'm just going to fold each of these back ever so slightly and we're going to leave another four strips of bacon across these so for every one we're going to start by you flipping it over alright and then we're going to pull the other sides I'm just using a v-formation for each of these strips you're going to notice they're all in the same formation make sure that the V is line up so that you don't have two ends together otherwise this just makes a weak point in your sandwich also by having four strips of bacon across we're going to make it nice and easy to fold it down the middle pretty brilliant right so I'm showing you the full fold on this one because you know I get lazy sometimes in other videos and don't feel like narrating the whole thing but here we are this is the full fold for it does all the back-and-forth we have our sandwich halfway done here so I'm just continuing with this notice it gets pretty easy at the end you don't have to fold over the whole strip of bacon anymore and we're just doing the exact same thing as before the exact same thing pretty easy Wow you can do that at home I just did okay so we're on our last strip of bacon here we're just going to throw this puppy down fold some ends over pull this third strip down here there you are good job Ross okay so now we're just going to pull over the end pull over and good enough good enough there we are they're gonna just slip that puppy down oh what a beauty what a beauty fold the ends over and we're done okay so cook this for about 15 minutes over medium heat flipping once until it looks like this great the bacon is almost finished cooking but not quite completely crisp this is where we throw on the cheese I'm using white cheddar pretty easy we're going to cover this for a few minutes until it's starting to melt like this now using tongs in a metal knife I'm just going to fold the sandwich over I'm going to degrease it and throw it on a plate there you are bacon grilled cheese what a lovely invention I'm Kristen McMahon and this is cooking with bacon
