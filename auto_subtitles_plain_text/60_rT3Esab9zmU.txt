 today on the edgy veg we are tackling another Taco Bell recipe because you guys have been asking for it we're making a chili cheese burrito mmm the first step in Taco Bell burrito making is taking some oil and heating it in a pan - the hot coconut oil we are going to add onions oh listen to that let those cook until they're translucent about three to five minutes the spices were using our cayenne pepper for some heat need some heat in there and then quite a bit of chili powder and then so much salt and just mix it together you want to do this fairly quickly so that your spices aren't burning to the pan you're going to want to take some cornstarch and add it to water and that's going to help thicken up our chili and then just mix it up and set it aside add some jalapenos however many you want depending on how spicy you like your food and all then we are going to add beta paste this is like doing like cheap quick chili on the stovetop mix that in and then we are going to take our cornstarch and slowly add it mixing at the same time and that's going to thin at that tomato paste and just go ahead and splash it all over your your oven that's what I like to do so once your MacGyver chili sauce has started to come to a boil you can add in your meat substitute of choice so you can add like walnut taco mix or I just bought this like veggie fake veggie minced meat mix it around until it is well incorporated after about five minutes add in your refried beans mmm so just mix in your beans until everything is super well incorporated and nice and thick this is going to be like a burrito sloppy joe and I am super excited to try it so now that this is all combined we are going to add our vegan cheese whatever brand you like the most put a nice big handful in there and then mix it all together again until it's melted now that you have your chili that you just made on the stove in just a few minutes we are going to make our chili cheese burrito we're gonna start by adding some cheese to our tortilla hey cheese however much you want you can leave to you and then just spoon in your chili don't pack it too much because it will burst out besides if you so on a dry pan lay down your burrito and that's going to help the burrito stay together and then do a quick one on the other side because that's where the cheese is you want to melt that and then you end up with this burrito now get out the napkins because this is messy let's uh let's give it a try mmm I would say that's a Taco Bell success so make sure that you give this video a big thumbs up if you like the recipe leave me a comment below letting me know what other fast food recipes you want me to do make sure that you subscribe to the channel and follow me on Instagram and Twitter and stuff no see you next time bye oh hi I didn't see you there isn't that a weird saying because clearly I did see you there which is why I'm talking to you now what you can do for me is you can subscribe you can watch my videos every Monday how about starting with this one or maybe this one alright see you next time I'll pour some coconut oil I'm going to fold up our Crunchwrap
