 let's move on to a very very royal dish I say royal because it's very high in calories we do not eat it every day so this is just like a feast once in a way and the dish I'm going to be cooking is vegetable biryani now typically you do have it with meat but let me show you a vegetarian variation of the same theory on e4 this false we need to make a paste of a couple of spices and herbs you have mint I'm just going to put it in the blender it take some mint mint leaves about if you're not too much into mint cut down on the mint and some cilantro and some onions and garlic ginger and some spices like a cardamom pod are you open it up and put in the seeds then you put whoops I'm sorry about this we put some coriander powder it always happens when you're on television right and you thought you are the only one who did it I do it too coriander powder and cumin powder you go ahead and make a nice puree of this and what you would get is something like this a very smooth paste of all the spices and herbs and what we're going to do is we are going to cook it till you have all the various flavors cook together and what you get is a beautiful beautiful blend of all the spices and herbs so I put some oil I guess I look right before it causes any more problems ok and I'm going to add the space in the hot oil have the oil you need to cook this for 10 minutes now let me tell you you have to cook this very well if you put it under pipette it will not taste good the book at time are on and cook it for 10 minutes because when you're inside of the cell and stirring you sort of feel it's almost done I think it's 10 minutes let me start cooking but the dish will not taste good so the secret for the biryani is cooking these spice blends really well and I have this cooks for about 10 minutes let me show you here now what I do is I add some yoga you see the difference in color this is well cooked after 10 minutes and this is a bright green look onions there's a really special thing about onions it has to be either raw or it has to be very very well cooked the in-between stage of onion is not something that you want to taste believe me I've done it many times and I've learnt it through the hard way here after this you add some new book of it if you are using these you would use it as a marinade and then leave the chicken pieces or nice pieces in there and let it cook for about two minutes or so and then add some vegetable that is wonderful vegetables mixed with this space how does that mean to say this wonderful place mix with a vegetable you can pick whatever you want now what I'm going to do is I'm going to layer the rice with this paste when you are cooking rice it would be an odd thing if you can add bay leaves it just gives more flavor to it so I take a pan and add this plain rice this is a typical North Indian dish and after this I'll add some vegetables and to give it a real rich taste what I'm going to do is add fried onions you can get the store-bought or you can fry the onions chop the onions I have found an easy way to fry onions chop the onions put it in the microwave for about five minutes and then fry it the frying becomes very easy and also i fried some cashew and a raisins I want you ahead of time this is not a low-calorie food it is high calorie food and then again go ahead put some rice now there are some people who do not like mint like my brother he will just not eat any food which has mint leaves in it so if there's any member in your family who doesn't like meat mint I'm sorry you can skip the mint and the cilantro and make the same pace as I showed you and in the end you add saffron but please do not mix saffron with the mint both has very strong that unique flavors and you don't want to mix these two flavors together here and now go ahead and put the fried onions around it go ahead and put the raisins and cashew on top of it if you were to use saffron instead of the mint and cilantro what you would do is put the saffron milk which the milk which you have soap saffron and just go ahead and pour it in it at this at this time after this is done put it put a aluminum foil on it and bake on a very low heat for about 10 minutes or so what happens is after baking all the flavors go through it and you have a wonderful rice of special herbs and special spices and fried onions and fried cashew and fried raisin it is a rice which you need to enjoy with a friend and it is a very special rice called as biryani
