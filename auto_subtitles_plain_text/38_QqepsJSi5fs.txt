 good afternoon everyone thanks for joining us cooking school today we're doing a pork fried rice and we'll make sure that we have all of our ingredients that we need to do our recipe the term for that is nice and plop it means everything in its place so I want to make sure that i have my pork I have my onions I have some bell pepper we have some carrot I've got celery green onion some egg a little olive oil butter and garlic and then I have a little low sodium soy sauce ok I'm going to I've got a preheating nice walk over here preheating this is a nice twist diamond walk you can probably get here it kissy could but you don't have to use a walk you can use a stir fry skillet okay or you can use a saute pan ok now that our walk is nice and hot we're going to add a little bit of olive oil roughly 2 tablespoons and a teaspoon of butter I love the combination of the butter and oil the butter is going to give me that flavor and a little browning on my meat and the olive oils gonna top that butter from burning oven okay I've got that incorporated we're going to add in our slivers of pork tenderloin and I have roughly ten houses that we're adding through our past okay work that guy around and again with stir frying go to make sure that you have minimal fat maximum meet so we want to get this walk nice and hot and you can hear that sizzle going into pants just constantly stir that guy and then around the meetup for you okay when I start to add my vegetables I want to kind of make a whale in the center where i can add my vegetables and my meats and continue to come and some chopped onion half a cup or so give it a whirl we're going to add our carrots I have roughly a cup of carrots slice on the bias okay with your that guy world we're going to add our celery and i want to add the veggies that will take a little longer to cook this the firmer veggies so that's why i went with my carrots and celery first okay get those guys to serve then I've got some diced red bell pepper will add fast cooking technique I'll let that simmer why I go and grab my rice hey back that fast so I've got some nice jasmine rice that we basically baldauf or steamed off according to the directions on our packet okay you can use water we use a little bit chicken stock because we want to flavor our rice so I use roughly two cups of jasmine rice and three cups of chicken stock brought that to a boil let that a boy al qaeda's cup role for about two minutes turn it off cover the pan let it sit for 20 minutes now that my vegetables are nice and stirred and started to saute we're going to add some green onion and some chopped fresh garlic I have two stalks of green onion and a tablespoon of our chopped fresh garlic now for our main flavoring we're going to get most of the flavor from the ingredients that's in the pan but for the rest of my flavor I'm going to add some low-sodium soy sauce and I have half a cup we add that right in to this I'm going to add some of my steamed white rice and just kind of fluff it apart and about two cups of my cook rice this is coming together very nicely and as you can see this is not a long cooking process stir frying and sauteing are really fast cooking techniques the important thing is that you want to make sure that the ingredients that you're putting in your stir-fry that you cut those as in similar size as much as you can so that our cooking time is even I don't want to have chunks of carrots or my even my pork too big to where it's going to take more time for that pork to cook and my vegetables get too soft all my rice gets too mushy now that my rice is starting to fry we're going to add I've got two eggs lightly beaten i'm going to add them damn but i have to swirl these guys in so that they scramble and give me a little texture on my rice I don't want it all in one clump we let that simmer for a second I'll finish my seasoning with a little cracked black pepper right on the top here give it a nice little toss and we're ready to play chopsticks aside right in the center and this recipe here it will be enough to serve four to six people thank you for joining us at kisi cook up chef 21 Simmons
