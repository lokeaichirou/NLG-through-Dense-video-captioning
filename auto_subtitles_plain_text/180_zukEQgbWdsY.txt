 today on dude food we're making our take on a BLT with East Coast swordfish and basil mayonnaise [Music] so we got this really beautiful East Coast swordfish you really want to shop for whatever is the best you know if swordfish is nice to get that if tunas nice to get that it's all about what is the best and that's gonna make the best sandwich you really want to look for a fish that has a little more fat content because that's gonna kind of compete with the with the bacon we're gonna put in this so we're gonna start off by by cooking the bacon turn it on medium heat and you want to make sure when you're when usually cast-iron pan you kind of put a little bit of olive oil in there get it nice and glistening and even when you're done washing you never want to wash it in the sink you always want to pull it off and wipe it down with a little bit of olive oil in the pan or grapeseed oil something to keep it moist and so it doesn't rust and the beauty of these pans is there's no like real hot spot you get a crank in the beginning turn it down and then it's gonna hold his feet really well probably gonna take about three three to four minutes to close about a minute and a half two minutes on each side okay I want to show her slice up the fish we have a piece of swordfish with it with the skin on it you just want to kind of remove that because that's not edible we want to get a nice thin piece flap it on the on the pan and cook it within you know ten seconds per side rest your hand on top of the fish try not to cut the top of your hand off and then just go through cut it right in half season both sides salt and pepper all right put the bacon out you can see it's getting get a little bit of color around it but it's not that crispy bacon to usun when you pull it pull it out of the oven if you want it to be kind of soft on the sandwich yeah let's get the fish on again you want a ripping hot pan so use like a grape seed oil or canola oil for this you can see a little bit of smoke coming out through the side that's when you want hit it take it off the heat a little bit and you want to cook this fish you want to cook it 75% on one side let it flip it your bass is just touching the heat to it and cooking it through so that's cooking I'm gonna show you how to toast the bread normally we put a little bit of butter on it but since we have this that's this great cast-iron pan with all this bacon fat in it you don't want let that go to waste just regular white Pullman low if you like Wonder Bread use Wonder Bread this you want to turn the pain down a little bit lower than what you had for baking the fish is starting to get a weight around the edge you got that nice char you're controlling the heat there's no burnt spots it's nice golden brown you're gonna get under there with that spatula get all that Brown bit off give it a flip face you basically by the time you flip the one flip the others going back to get the other one out again it's it's it's cooked through but it's not it's not gonna be dry or overcooked so the last part of this dish is the basil mayonnaise we're gonna get a pot of boiling water and we're gonna get the basil we're just gonna blanch it very quickly in salted water about 30 seconds and then shock it in an ice bath and you're gonna squeeze it like Jeff just did you guys we use all that liquid outta the shocking shocking me is getting ice water ice cubes and then you want it you want to basically reduce the cooking temperature of it very very rapidly and that's gonna retain that green color all right okay we're gonna have the eggs in here three egg yolks and some lemon juice well that's funny you might have to add a little touch of water the olive oil a little bit at a gun so you want to make sure you had a little bit of salt and pepper in there you always want to make sure you season everything all right so now we're gonna put together the sandwich slather some of the basil mayonnaise on top Brad you give me a piece of swordfish your throw on top of that yeah but you want each point to have part of the swordfish you know you don't want one plate just to have bacon and tomato and not have swordfish put a couple pieces of bacon on a little bit of lettuce I mean if you don't have big lettuce you can use iceberg you can use romaine whatever kind of whatever kind of salad green you want you want to put on there works fine so just a couple tomatoes on top a little more basil mayonnaise on top all right cut that so we can try that beautiful look at that bacon swordfish basil mayonnaise
