 [Music] everyone is singing cook my name is Cheryl and you're watching me cook a very famous dish you know in India what we do is go out to dine especially on the highways now only highways you'll find excellent Abbas now these are kind of rustic restaurants roadside eateries but they're very very famous you know some of them are legends actually everybody remembers going there and dining and I I remember a few of them one of them is near Bombay you know in Lonavala sometimes when I go to Punjab I see this very famous dhaba on the Ambala road towards Chandigarh and I'm sure it will remind you of the chicken curry that you've eaten there and that's what I'm trying to do now the highway chicken curry that's what I'm cooking okay for highway chicken curry what you require is quickly some onions which I am going to cut now if you are cooking around 800 grams of chicken on the bone essentially on the bone only okay otherwise no fun take at least four onions and I'll slice them in the meanwhile what do you need to do your vessel cooking vessel on the flame oil here required is little more than usual now high weight chicken curries are generally high fragrant dishes little spicier that's what they're famous for that's why we like them and garam masala the blend and the whole garam masala is little hike so what I'm doing is cinnamon here black cardamom four to five of them when you put black cardamom important open them up okay otherwise what's going to happen if they burst there's a chance of you you know getting hurt so very important four or five of them small cardamom six eight of them nice fragrance okay cumin 1 teaspoon some cloves in here and before this thing burn I need to slice the onions Wow managed to cook fast and human is nice and brown moment you smell the fragrance of the spices you add this sliced onion four of them is what I have sliced for approximately 800 grams of chicken on board that's very very important saute the onions very rustic curry the quantity of tomatoes added is also quite high in this and one more thing I must tell you the quantity of ginger and green chilli is also high when you eat them you must get that slurry thing anyhow you must hear that this is what you need to hear that that's what we all like when we go out dining especially the chicken curry yeah take tomatoes 3 large tomatoes and I am going to cut them chop them actually I've got chicken already in here now I must tell you the highway guys you know some of them use Desi Ghee or saturated fat I've got some here you want to add it you can add it what's going to happen is it's going to increase the taste so if it's a matter of taste let me add 1 tablespoon of this just one table too so that brings out the great flavor oil also a WoW suddenly the profile changes you know the smell of this change is absolutely divine now let this get round tomatoes to be chopped or watchful eye in here stir this up as the onion start browning up what you need to do next is be prepared with the ginger and garlic paste very important so here the quantity of ginger is more than the garlic that's what I do hence the pastes are separate but you have a choice you can use definitely ginger garlic paste together and later you can add the ginger Julianne's that I'm garage here ginger paste 1 and 1/2 tbsp garlic paste one tablespoon saute for about a minute treat every ingredient with respect yeah the way you would do to your family members this is the family member off the chicken curry the hybrid chicken curry so let this saute the smell should go off and then the tomatoes that go in some people do add the tomatoes later after the chicken because they think the quantity I mean the time taken to cook the chicken is increased yes because of the acidity it does happen but I want the tomatoes who get pulpy and mushy you know so that the gravy becomes smooth if you have the chicken first and then the tomatoes the tomatoes will not get bulkier and you might not get a smooth gravy so after you add tomatoes you need to cook for at least four five minutes so that the whole mixture gets Messier and smoother and then the next thing to let this get cook first for at least four five minutes now as the tomatoes are getting pulp here yet see the getting pulp here which makes the gravy smoother what I'm going to do is this will keep cooking and in the meanwhile I'll slice some ginger and cut some Julianne's of this so take about half an inch piece of ginger and cut Julianne's of the same some green chilies three of them now this is the spicier one so you need to be careful three of them if you don't like it spicy you can't avoid it but what you need to do is slit it from the middle all this goes in to this mixture ginger julienne screen chilies absolute rustic yeah now next I'm going to add some red chilli powder one and a half teaspoon if you get the colored variety the Kashmiri variety is very good one and a half tablespoon of coriander powder 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder and 1/4 teaspoon of the turmeric garam masala 1 TSP of this okay and this you need to add while you're cooking okay that's important and then you need to add salt singalong jump dance to whatever you want to do do number Shama this is what you can do okay there you go suddenly the chicken curry starts looking good now the masala especially cook this further for 3-4 minutes after you add the dry spices now if this chicken was not farm fed like what probably I remember during my childhood days it would never be farm for chicken like what we call broiler chicken this would have been cooked before the tomatoes were added because the local chicken that they see chicken as we Indians call doesn't get cooked easily okay so as you cook the ginger garlic and the onions then you need to add the chicken with its little tough part the taste I tell you is amazing this one you can take a risk of adding later when all the spices have been added everything has been added then you add the chicken is absolutely fine because this doesn't take too much time to cook so what I'm going to do is after 3-4 minutes of cooking the entire thing with the dry spices and the salt everything together see the color is absolutely beautiful the chicken goes in keep cooking without the water in this let the chicken get cooked with the spices tomatoes and onion I'm not going to add any kind of water at this point of time let this get cooked maybe cover this up yes cover this up and let it get cooked we'll keep stirring in between in the meanwhile one very important thing loads of coriander is also added to this dish so about 2-3 tbsp chopped coriander if you want to measure the quantity in tablespoons probably three tablespoons of chopped coriander gives a nice flavor to the dish this is something which is very very fragrant coriander in India used probably almost in everything some dishes we added before while we are cooking actually in some we would add as a carnation on top nowadays yes all chefs prefer you know adding a sprig of it but in a dish like this which is rustic I would certainly add this point of time only gives a nice flavor coriander came here and at this point of time first give a stir after cooking about 5 minutes in the dry spices I'll add some water so in goes the water about 500ml of water is what you will add to the chicken and now cover this up and cook the highway curries are generally thin so water you can keep adjusting I have added 500ml of water first the chicken will also whose out water and let this get cooked for at least six to eight minutes nicely in the spices and then little more of garam masala in the last before we finish the dish after about 15 minutes you know what you need to see is Wow look at this now the whole gravy looks delicious very important to note that the chicken should be cold now how would you come to know one important thing is to note that especially take the leg piece as it keeps shrinking and the entire flesh gets pulled up then you know the chicken is almost cooked you start seeing the bone down here this is what you see and you come to know that's when the chicken is cooked so now this is ready if you think it is not ready when you are cooking probably the chicken would be bigger so you can cook further you no more than 15 minutes finally some more garam masala increase the fragrance I added initially also and now once again chicken is ready so called a beautiful polio very rustic you seem very rustic absolutely divine the curry is thin it's never thick the onions are usually like this what you see here and it's spicy I am just garnishing it with fresh coriander you can straightaway take some bread take some buns get some steamed rice if you really want to enjoy get some steamed rice and then eat it remember the highways days this is or it is [Music]
