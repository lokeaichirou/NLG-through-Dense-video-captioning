 hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with Waldorf salad that's right I'm going to show you my take on America's most famous fruit salad and for whatever reason if you've never had one of these before you are in for a huge treat this thing is just a triumph of taste and texture I mean do you have any idea how delicious a fruit salad has to be to actually get a name that's not easy so that should tell you something so let me go ahead and show you my version for this and first up we're going to prep the celery but we're not going to use regular stock celery we are going to use celery root which looks like this and what we're going to do to prep this we're going to cut the top off and yes absolutely I'm going to save that and use it for regular stock celery and then we'll also trim off the bottom although I cut off way too much and then if you I can peel this with a regular vegetable peeler but that surface is kind of narrow Lee so I like to just go around with a knife like this kind of shave it off that skin and we're going to go all the way around as well as trim up the bottom until basically we just have that white root and once that's been trimmed up what we'll do is we'll cut like quarter-inch slices and then we'll take those slices and cut them into about quarter-inch sticks and you know what let's go ahead and loop dangerously and do two at once thereby doubling our production speed and once we've cut those in the sticks as you well know all we need to do is turn them and cut them into nice fairly even cubes so we will cube up our celery roots and once that's done what we'll do is we'll toss it in some cold water and just let it sit there while we're prepping our other ingredients and this is not so much to prevent discoloration but I want those cubes to be fully hydrated and also I think that water might leach away just a little bit of the bitterness but I can't prove it but anyway regardless I'm gonna leave mine in some cold water and move on to the next thing you want to prep ahead of time your walnuts so we're going to toast a handful of walnut pieces in a dry pan over medium heat just throw them in and toss them around until basically they smell like toasted walnuts and it's really not that easy to see I camera here but they are going to turn a little bit golden and you might see a few brown marks here and there but we don't want to go too far take a dark brown they're going to be too bitter so like I said the best indication is just toss those around in the dry pan until they sort of smell like toasted walnuts at which point we'll transfer those onto a plate to cool because of course the last thing you want on your salad is hot nuts so we will set those aside and let them cool off while we move on to the next thing on the prep list the dressing which is ridiculously simple so in a bowl we're going to start with three parts mayonnaise to which we're going to add one part sour cream or creme fraiche and I think it's pretty obvious which one I'm using and then to that we're going to add a little bit of sugar just a couple pinches as well as a pinch of salt a little touch of freshly ground black pepper and then of course so everything tastes better a little touch of cayenne and then it finishes off we're gonna add the juice of half a lemon of course freshly squeezed what kind of crazy person with access to fresh lemons is using the stuff in the bottle and then last but not least a little bit of freshly chopped tarragon my all-time favorite seafood herb is also my favorite all-time fruit salad herb and then we'll go ahead and mix that together and our super simple but insanely delicious Waldorf salad dressings done so we'll give that a little whisk in and then of course taste for seasoning and because this is going to get tossed with other ingredients it is hard to know for sure but you are going to want to taste it anyway I mean it's sitting right there and once our salad dressing is set we are ready to move to final assembly so the main ingredient in this salad is fresh apples and this is how I suggest you prep them so we're going to take our apple and cut it right down the middle and then we'll cut each of those halves in half to make quarters and then this is how I like to remove the core we'll just turn that piece like this and then using our knife at about a 45 degree angle we'll just make one little cut right there and that core or at least 25% of it is going to be gone so very quick and easy technique to remove those seeds and then once we have our Apple quartered and cored we will simply slice those wedges lengthwise and cut them into whatever size chunks we want so that is the official food wishes technique so we'll go ahead and toss our apples in a bowl to which we can add our very well drained celery root cubes I'm also going to do some green grapes which I've quartered seedless green grapes please do not use the ones with seeds instead of making a Waldorf salad you'll make an annoying salad and we'll also toss in our now cool toasted walnut pieces and that's it do not screw this salad up I try to be creative and throw a bunch extra stuff in some people put in dried fruit things like that but I'm not into it the only other thing we're going to put in here is our dressing and we do want our fruit coated but we don't want it totally swimming in the dressing so what I'll do is I'll throw some in and mix it up and then evaluate so that's what I'm doing right now I'm staring at it thinking to myself chef Jon you need a little more dressing that's what I call myself in my head so I tossed it in another spoon and gave it a mix and once that's mixed up and we feel like we have the perfect amount of dressing all we need to do is give it a taste make sure everything's just right and then we have options we can serve this immediately which I actually enjoy or you can wrap that up and put it in the fridge for up to 24 hours this actually holds surprisingly well and then as far as how to serve it you have so many options as you saw it made a beautiful base for some pan-roasted chicken breasts but this is also a terrific side dish for things like roast turkey or pork chops very nice with this but having said all that I think my favorite way to enjoy this is just in a bowl just as a simple standalone fruit salad so that's how I'll be finishing this video off just serving that up as is with maybe a couple sliced grapes for a little color contrast and of course a few extra toasted walnuts are going to hurt anything and that's it our Waldorf salad is done so let me go ahead and dig in and like I said I just love the combination of tasting textures here sweet crunchy tangy just really really fantastic and while I do enjoy Waldorf salad just using regular celery stalks I think by using the root we get a little more interesting a little more mild flavor but yet it still has enough of that bitter celery flavor to bring out the sweetness in the other fruit which really is what makes the salad so delicious but anyway that's it my take on the venerable Waldorf salad which as you may have guessed by the name was invented at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York back in the day so while this is a very old salad it is still very relevant and by relevant I mean incredibly delicious and easy to make so I really do hope you give this a try soon head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
