 hello I'm David and welcome to 101 cooking easy and I'm here with another quick and easy one pot pasta spaghetti and meatballs it only takes about 45 minutes and it'll serve four to five so let's get started okay I'm going to start with about a pound and a half of sweet Italian sausage and I'll add 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder one teaspoon of Italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper and with clean hands I'll mix well and you can make spaghetti and meatballs many different ways you can use ground beef a mix of ground beef and veal turkey chicken Italian sausage sweeter hot I'm using the sweet and you can cocoa many different ways you can bake them in the oven you can fry them cook them in the sauce and I know a lot of people will boil them just to discard the fat and then cook them in the sauce and I'm going to do something like that but not quite because that's where all the flavor it is I'm gonna set my stove on medium and I'm gonna add about 2 and a half to 2 and 3/4 cups of beef broth or you can use vegetable now I'll just go ahead and make the meatballs while everything is heating up and this will make about 18 to 20 meatballs about the size of a golf-ball doing it like this really does have its advantages and I don't mean just doing everything in one pot I have a small wood stove about a 35 BTU and doing it like this makes it so much easier just to do all my wood stove and I can cook anything from a low to medium temperature on that wood stove it just takes a little while it's like a slow cooker and this really speeds it up and I can bring two to three cups of broth to boil on that wood stove and hardly any time but 2 or 3 quarts and to have to boil that for spaghetti and that would take me all day okay I finished up my meatballs I'm going to give that a quick cover and let that come to a boil I'm still on medium and once that comes to a boil I'm going to reduce the heat to medium-low cover and let those simmer for about 20 minutes stirring every few okay it's been about 20 minutes I'm going to set these aside for a few minutes okay I'm going to crank the heat back up to medium and add the spaghetti and actually you can use any long cut pasta here vermicelli angel here pound for pound it's all about the same as long as you can get it to lay flat and about two cups of broth that's great this pot is slightly under but it still works out just fine and don't forget about half a cup will simmer off when you do the meatballs and draggin a fork back and forth across the top helps keep it loose and I'll only do this for about a minute just to make sure it's good and loose then I'll just cover and let that finish coming to a boil and once it comes to a boil I'll give it one more quick stir with a fork reduce the heat to medium-low and by the way this pasta will need about 6 minutes to reach all dente I'll reduce the heat to medium-low cover and check it again in three minutes okay it's been about three minutes and it's looking pretty good and it'll need another three minutes I'm gonna cut the heat back to low cover and I'll check it a few times between 9 I want it to finish absorbing the broth but I don't want to burn it or dry out okay it's been about three minutes and it's cooked a total of about six and it looks fine it's absorbed all the broth and I didn't need to add any water time to add the sauce and I'm going to add about 24 ounces of tomato sauce then I'll add about two pinches of Italian seasoning and my pinches are about the size of half a teaspoon and two pinches of dried oregano another 1/2 teaspoon each of onion powder garlic powder salt and about another quarter teaspoon of ground black pepper then I'll give all that a good stir add back the meatballs and stir them in cover turn the heat back up to about medium and give that about five to ten minutes to reheat and there you go here are one pot pasta spaghetti and meatballs plain simple quick and easy this has always been one of my favorites and now even more so it really hasn't been quite cold enough to light the wood stove yet but it's getting there and I'll be uploading again soon until then enjoy you
