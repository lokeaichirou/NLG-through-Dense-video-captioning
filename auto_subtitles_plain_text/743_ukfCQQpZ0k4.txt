 now i'm going to be using an onion red pepper or capsicum a couple of tens of coconut milk I'm using some laksa paste that you buy the supermarket i'm going to try using a hooky and noodles although you could use two minute or ramen noodles if you wish and for my seafood i'm using these beautiful fresh local prawns or shrimp now you can use whatever seafood you like or you could use chicken as well but prawns are nice and easy and simple so I'm just going to use them so what I've done is cut the capsicum up into fine strips and you don't have to use capsicum but I just like it for the color I've also diced the onions and I have cut their heads off these prawns which I'm now going to wash now i'm going to leave the shell on them but if you do want to peel them please do okay so first I'm just going to add a little bit of oil now I'm going to add the onions and the laps of sauce now it's time to add the prawns we're going to cook that for about Oh see that spicy we're going to cook that for about three minutes keep stirring that occasionally after the three minutes we're going to add one haha of the coconut milk and the capsicum just stir that through we're going to turn the heat down once that starts to boil and let that simmer for about five minutes uncovered now if you think that source is looking a little bit too thick just add one tin of the coconut milk and maybe half a team of water now while it's simmering for five minutes it's time to prepare the noodles now these noodles are very easy to prepare only takes a minute just need to put them in a bowl then cover them with boiling water then you just need to gently separate them using some toms and we'll just let them sit for about a minute now once that one minute is up we just need to gently drain the water from the noodles now by the time those noodles are all heated the prawns should be nicely cooked and it's time to serve up so now it's just time to pour this mix fill up that bowl
