 well howdy today we want to do some beef shish kebabs I got pretty good recipe here at we're going to make a marinade to let them let the or meet soak in for we need you want it to marinate for at least two hours in our case we're going to let it set overnight the first thing we want to do is make our marinade and we start with 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar eighth of a teaspoon of paprika eighth of a teaspoon of black pepper eighth of a teaspoon of garlic powder and an eighth of a teaspoon of onion powder then we mix in two-thirds cup of the red wine of the burgundy or you want to some kind of a dry right wine Burgundy's a good one that's what this is stir make sure all the stuff gets dissolved in there that's it it's a pretty simple marinade that's basically all there is to it right there and in that we we bought a chuck roast you can also use a sirloin steak you want something that's lots at least an inch thick just because we're going to be cutting this in cubes and you don't want little bitty slivers of me you want one a good chunk there but base you know you can use sirloin or basically any any cut of meat and we're just going to cut this into cubes okay we got all our meat cubed up about a inch cubes that's kind of the way I la comes like this going to put them all in our Ziploc baggie and then put a marinade on top of it it's all working their way I like to do is let all the get all the air out of it and just let it let it set like that overnight and are at least two hours we're going to set it overnight and then we'll come back in the morning and put them in our PG 500 and that's some vegetables to them and grill them well honey we've had our stuff marinate we let this marinate overnight you don't have to let it marinate overnight but at least two hours and as you're letting it marinate you need to if you're using the bamboo skewers like we're using you need to make sure that they get soaked in water for at least two hours and easiest way to good is I just put these in a pan filled it about a third of the way full of water and put a paper towel over all the skewers to make sure that they stayed underwater so they're good and wet now or marinades been we've let this soak for overnight and we're ready to make some shish kebabs now I'm a to skewer man and the reason why i like to use two skewers is when you put the meat on and all the vegetables you can turn it real easy and the meat just don't spend on the on the stick so the used to and start off with piece of piece of our meat there leave you about leaving enough to hang on to and then just add some vegetables I've already chopped this the I've got a red onion some button mushrooms some zucchini and some bell peppers and I like the yellow and red and green bell peppers just because I think they taste good and they're purdy and it don't hurt when your dish looks purdy and just make it it don't matter what order you put this stuff in just just put it in there well we got all our fish kebabs assembled or shish kebabs is my youngest cousin we both we made both the chicken and beef we've used the same marinade on both of them so to make it easy and when we get when we got them all done you might you saw that up put a real light coat of olive oil on brush them with all around that's just to help them not stick when we put them on the grill and one of the neat things about the PG 500 which is what we're going to be using today there's a direct side and an indirect side we're going to smoke them on the indirect side for about two hours at 225 and then after the two hours we're going to go back out there and I'm going to put a nice little char on them on the direct side and then put them in the warming drawer we've got a warming drawer on that PG 500 that'll keep everything nice and hot until all of its done so let's go out there cook them on the PG 500 well we got them done it took about an hour and a half we cook them that at 225 and what you want to do is bring the meat temperature up to about all about a hundred and twenty hundred and thirty and then finish them off on the high side that way you get some nice grill marks on them you can use your warming tray to keep the ones that you get done keep them hot while you finish off the rest of them that's the neat things about the PG 500 but a little note just make sure if you use like we used a pot roast you'll need to do some trimming on that to trim out the the gristle and stuff so that you're not you don't have beef bubblegum but they turned out really good there's nothing to do but enjoy them if you have any questions or like to discuss this recipe or anything else just feel free to give me a call at 800 4 230 698 or you can drop me an email at B underscore vice at cook Shack calm or visit us on the web at WWF I
