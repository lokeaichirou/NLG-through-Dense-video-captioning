 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with good old-fashioned pancakes that's right anybody can add water to a box mix but you're better than that or at least I assume you're better than that so let me show you how to make your own classic American diner style old-fashioned pancakes so easy and here we go so step one here we're gonna sift our dry ingredients which is a flour just regular all-purpose flour we're gonna add some baking powder not soda baking powder some salt and some sugar and then we're gonna sift that now you know I'm not big on sifting if I've said it once I've said it a hundred times there's no money in sifting okay but here kind of important so I want you to sift at this time once it's all sifted we are going to add melted butter an egg and some milk now one tip here I want you to be standing there with your whisk ready to go as soon as you add those wet ingredients I want you to mix this quickly okay so I popped that egg yolk and then I whisk vigorously until it's combined now why I want you to have the whisk ready as soon as you add the wet ingredients is because if you add that butter and the egg and the cold milk and then go look for the whisk and come back five minutes later that cold milk will have solidified that butter and it just won't mix in as well so make sure you have all your stuff handy and like I said you're just gonna whisk that until it comes together should look like that looks like pancake batter all right I'm gonna let that sit for five minutes to give that baking powder a little chance to sort of start doing its chemical reaction thing and then you know the rest it's the same as if you use that package mix I'm gonna preheat a nice big skillet on medium-high I'm gonna give it a little light spraying with vegetable oil and then I use a quarter cup measuring scoop to make my pancakes all right like the little ones you can make giant big ones I guess but I like kind of three smaller ones for a serving and then the classic question how do I know when to turn it well you've heard the expression being able to read body language here you have to be able to read bubble language that's right the bubbles will tell you first you're gonna see bubbles around the outside then you're gonna see bubbles come up through the middle when the bubbles come up through the middle turn your pancake it works every time so depending on your flame depending on your pan medium to medium-high heat should be perfect once you flip them the other side goes a little quicker so if the first I took 2-3 minutes maybe the second side takes a minute to two minutes but you'll know you know when pancakes are cooked we're all born with that ability it's in our DNA all right I'm gonna transfer those to a warm plate nothing says I don't really love you that much like serving food on ice cold plates so don't do that especially for breakfast I'm gonna spread a little bit of butter on top you know optional but by optional I mean please do it it's not pancakes let's get a little melted butter on there and then cue gratuitous maple syrup scene sorry I can't find my sexy music sound clip but anyway you can hum that part to yourself and there we go good old-fashioned pancakes how amazingly simple this is the classic recipe not too thick not too thin tender delicious just amazing so I really hope you give these a try this was a very popular food wish all the ingredients are on food wishes calm as usual and as always enjoy [Music]
