 hi guys today we're gonna be making a General Tso's chicken actually pretty simple to make firstly he is set up breading stations have some flour egg and breadcrumb and of course a chicken i diced mine so just take a piece of chicken dump it in the flour and then the egg and then the breadcrumbs it's about to be really messy put on a baking sheet lined with foil and spray it with coconut oil when I keep it in the oven for about 20 minutes again drill goes by with sesame oil in it together now it's time to slowly Porter's Watson right now is liquidy but just wait for about four to five minutes and it will be more syrupy and salty like you know it gain more self this how your chicken should look like when it comes out of the oven you even eat this as like maybe chicken nugget now I'm just stirring the chicken I'll just mix the chicken together mixture every pick a chicken get some even an ounce - it was no green onion and there you go general chicken
