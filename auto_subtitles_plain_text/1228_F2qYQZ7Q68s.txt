 hey everybody and welcome to the Wolfe pit tonight we're gonna make some beef and bean burritos I'm not really shooting for an authentic recipe this is just going to be the way I'm going to make them tonight so what we have here so far is we got two pounds of frozen 80/20 ground beef so we're going to melt this down and brown it up all right ground beef is all browned up and there's not really a lot of fat in this so it was 80/20 but there's shirt on a lot of fat in there so I look at my branding now what I'm going to do is add in one large yellow onion chopped up and one medium bell pepper chopped up now I'm going to add in our seasonings so I've got two teaspoons of black pepper tablespoon of granulated garlic a teaspoon of salt a tablespoon of oregano teaspoon of cumin and about three tablespoons of chili powder all right now I'm going to add in about a cup of salsa in one can of undrained black beans this is just my preference I hear a lot of people grilling me a little bit about not draining the beans but I like to juice in the beans all right now we're gonna add in about about a cup and a half of cooked rice all right we got our burrito filling all done all the moisture is pretty much soaked up all right so we're going to put about a half a cup of filling inside the burrito they want to sprinkle that with some cheese and now we're going to roll it up squeeze it tight fold it over and rolled up as important you heat up your shelves just a little bit before you roll them up otherwise we're going to crack alright our beef and bean burritos are done and you could you could top these with guacamole salsa sour cream jalapenos what-have-you I'm just gonna eat them plain tonight so we're gonna go ahead and bust into one of these and see how they turned out mmm very meaty very cheesy mmm very good nope thank you guys very much for watching and we'll see you next time
