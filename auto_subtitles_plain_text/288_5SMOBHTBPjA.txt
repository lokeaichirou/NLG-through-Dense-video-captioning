 hi I'm Archana welcome to my kitchen in today's recipe I'm going to show you how to make masala dosas that is a very classic South Indian dish in this dish boil potatoes a spice with ginger green chillies and curry leaves and filled into a rice and lentil CREP called those odds without wasting no time let's dive right in to see how to make this simple and delicious South Indian dish now we'll begin making the masala for the masala dosas using the potatoes to begin with add in just a teaspoon of oil again I try to use as less oil as possible and once the oil is heated I'm going to heat the pan once the oil is heated add in some mustard seeds and this is haft would have done these our lentils that add delicious flavors to the masala dosa again I'm not going to be using onions because I'm showing you how to cook at the South quick way but you could optionally add onions as well okay the dal is well browned just browned enough at this stage I'm going to grate in an inch piece of ginger and I have one green chilli that I've chopped up here and some curry leaves that I've chopped too chopping and tearing the curry leaves gives added flavor to the masala as opposed to having adding it as a whole leaf and now I'm going to add in the potatoes have chopped up the boiled potatoes stir it in so that the potatoes get well coated with the seasoning next the turmeric powder I don't add the turmeric powder to the oil because it could tend to burn then the salt and give it a stir now this looks more like a vegetable because you see the potatoes are chopped and doesn't really look like a masala that you find or eat normally so what I'm going to do is use the potato masher just give the potatoes a gentle mash you don't want it to become a lump or the dough but you just want them to be mashed a little bit so this is a good technique to mash up your potatoes and give the masala dosa masala good texture that's it the masala dosa is now ready what I'm now going to do is to chop up some coriander leaves and add it to this to give an added flavor to the masala dosa smelling delicious I can't wait to make the dosas and have this with some coconut chutney so now we'll proceed to make the dosas for the masala dosa so now I'm going to take a ladder full of batter put it in the center and and spread it evenly around you could either use oil or you could go use ghee to cook your dosas and I'm just gonna add in a little bit of key because masala dosas and gr a great combination and yes G is sattvic too according to the Ayurvedic diet you can optionally cover the dough cells where the lid and allow the steam to cook the doses or you can cook it open when you do cook it open you will find the tops a little bit raw and I will show you a technique how to remove the rawness from the top after about a couple of less than a minute you will start finding brown spots on the dozer and that's when you know it's ready and now if you did not use a lid to cover the pan the stick of flat spatula and spread the raw batter around like this and that's what most restaurant people do so what I'm going to do now it's perfectly steamed hand see how beautifully it comes out of the pan because the pan is well-seasoned and now if you are using a nonstick pan you don't have to worry at all so now I'm going to use you can either serve the masala separately with the dosa but as always we do place a large ladle of the masala in it towards the center and what I'm going to do is to do a double fold hold it press it down a little bit and your Wragge Multi millet multigrain masala dosa is now ready a lot of times you have to make sambar chutney and the extra paraphernalia to have masala dosas but at home we have it with idli milega puddi and some yogurt it's as simple as that and we just simply love it with this do do give the super simple recipe a try in your kitchen and when you do don't forget to give feedback in the comments below and how you twist it and modify this recipe until then until next time happy cooking and healthy eating
