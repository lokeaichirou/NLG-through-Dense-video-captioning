 yeah yeah I'm remembering my mother chicken curry welcome to YouTube my name is her pulsing Sookie and axing and cook we are cooking mother's recipe something which we all cherish right when we were children we would love to sit besides a mother and then kind of look at what she was doing and this is something which is very close to my heart very personal I miss that taste of course I'm trying to replicate that in YouTube just for you so what do we require first of all my mother used to you know grind spices that were whole and them used in the recipe so I've got some coriander here around two large tablespoons of coriander 1 tablespoon of cumin into this okay she would use black cardamom so you get a nice flavor this is very flavorful so I'm just adding four of them some bay leaf into this - three bay leaf okay she would definitely add peppercorn peppercorn to this cinnamon round two to three pieces not bigger than this size and let's dry roast this for some time this is something which she would really do you know all the spices she would roast and then grind it very passionately she would cook this curry and the flavors I still can't forget them so what I'm doing here nice spices all of them whole I'm like dry roasting them I don't want them to be colored but just get that nice flavor out so this should not take more than 30 to 40 seconds do not roast it on a high flame or anything on a high kind of you know burner or something like that so this should not be colored flavors are nice now what I'm going to do is grind this up what up your full blender here so let me just grind them all the dry spices and that's the beauty of this correct all the spices into the correct beautiful this remember our parents who very dearly thought all this and used to passionately cook food for us especially in India I'm sure you will all agree this yeah anywhere in the world actually some time or the other parents must have done something good feed us nice food and this is what I am sharing with you so let me this is my scent powdery all flavors fresh I'll not unlock it because I want all the flavors to be absolutely intact next quickly light this burner up let me pour some oil some generous helping of oil actually 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in this she would definitely use a lot of oil and let the oil get heated up the meanwhile let me slice up some onions quickly quickly because the oil is heating up you know so onions sliced absolutely finally and this into the oil oil is hot let me slice another one and slice 3 to 4 onions for chicken curry so making like a kilo of chicken at least 4 onions are required onions here fast and quick that's what I am going and thanks to this knife all the onions into this some are getting ground some are just added now to get a great flavor here so let me give a quick stir to this now something which I remember my mom would never do is brown the onions she would not brown the onions probably because browning the onions Wow this is making me cry the emotional quotient yeah it's because of the onions and yes because of my mother's recipe so she would not actually brown the onions because that would require too much of oil right so she would just slice it and add to this and cook it until it has translucent now tomatoes she would also not make fury of the tomatoes one properly because I feel we were all living in small villages during those days you did not get anything that was hybrid you used to get what we call is locally available tomatoes that were locally grown you would get that now those tomatoes a little Tangier then what we have now is not so sweet as these hybrid ones that we grow now yeah wild onions get cooked translucent my chopping of tomatoes is also over onions now getting lightly Brown this point where I am going to do is add the ginger and garlic paste she would use one tablespoon of ginger and garlic paste separately one tablespoon of each into the mixture and Wow saw Phyllis but just around 30 seconds onions and ginger garlic cooktop what we'll do is add the tomatoes into this no puring of tomatoes that's important because one when you puree Tomatoes I feel you don't get a bright red color so don't Kure tomatoes that's what my mother also never used to do and I am also not doing it because I want to show you something which is cooked my mother style you know tribute to my mother here and sharing of this recipe with all of you beautiful so let this get cooked for some time let's cover this up and let it get cooked until the tomatoes are absolutely mushy so that you get a nice gravy in the meanwhile this is something which we had ground all spices that we had cooked here they're nice and course it's not a complete powder beautiful flavor now to this my mom used to add ginger powder also so I'm adding half a teaspoon of ginger powder she used to add whole dried ginger to the garam masala so I'm adding dried ginger to this and mix this up close it up because I don't want all the flavors to you know kind of run away from this beautiful blend of spices that happen it let it be here meanwhile let's look at the tomatoes let them get mushy let them get cooked for some time let us now check tomatoes are nice and mushy now it's almost you read here and you get a great taste when you use tomatoes like this so now what we will do is add the rest of things add some chili powder she would add a teaspoon of chili powder two types of chilies go on inside now the black pepper and red chili now we have some turmeric 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric salt to taste salt inside what some cream Chili's also she would add green chilies but chop it up just like this in a large way green chilies inside this and let's saute this up beautiful what I'm going to do is now going to add the chicken to this so let me cook the chicken together no water just cook the chicken together with all the onions tomatoes and spices chicken let it get cooked meanwhile I've got some coriander my mother definitely would add a lot of coriander lots of coriander let's chop this up and keep it aside while the chicken gets cooked here is coriander check the chicken getting cooked beautifully now we'll do is we'll add all these spices that I've grown so all spices here the little coarse but that's what the flavor is that's a beautiful flavor of the garam masala coriander cumin pepper everything and in goes the dry spice here Wow all of it inside the curry that's what she used to do grind only that much of spices that are required for the dish so that everything stays the fresh if you were to do this curry in your house do follow the way I am doing here now beautiful suddenly this lot of flavors that have erupted from the chicken curry we cook for another 4 to 5 minutes before I add water to make a curry so let this get cooked for 4 to 5 minutes becomes nice and good because the chicken would also leave its own juices and then we'll add water as required to make a curry which is not very thin but not very thick also so let the chicken get cooked Wow divine flavors I must tell you and after sorting just become too good you can just eat it like this but I am making my mother's chicken curry so to this at least 3 cups of water let's bring this to a boil now beautiful now this chicken curry you see is not a very clean clean dish it's nice and coarse you see these spices they still course the onions are like whole and the tomatoes also like they got massive but most of the ingredients are really not in a fine texture form that's because during my mother's days we never used to have a blender chop word they would grind everything in a stone you know so that's why most of the things used to be coarse so let's cook this curry now and bring it to a boil till the time the chicken also gets cooked curry gets nice and beautiful chicken curry is now cooked for around 10 minutes so let me give a stir Wow as you open the lid what flavors and what flavors I remember my mother beautiful play spices course curry reminding me of my childhood days finally some coriander into this lots of it because she would love to add coriander and that's because it also gives a nice fresh flavor to the curry beautiful Wow I am amazed at the way this chicken curry has come out let me just have a quick taste I tell you I've gone back to my childhood days same taste same play was just too good to try it in your houses let me know if you have remembered your days childhood days chicken curry a mother style just for you
