 hello and welcome to easy gluten free today I'll be showing fave healthy recipes calm how to do a copycat version of cracker barrels hash brown casserole now there's no shortage of knockoffs for the recipe but all the ones I've seen call for a can of condensed cream of chicken soup which usually contains gluten so I'm going to show you a gluten free alternative to that ingredient and I'm also going to lighten it up with lower calories swap outs from some of the original ingredients so you won't feel too guilty with this version alright to make this you're gonna need a 30 ounce bag of defrosted frozen hash browns where you could just grate 2 pounds of potatoes yourself if you want 1 large onion that's been peeled and finely diced a 12 ounce can of evaporated skim milk 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon granules make sure it's gluten free if you're on a gluten-free diet a cornstarch slurry which is 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of cold water until you have a lump free mixture 7 ounces of low-fat Greek yogurt 6 ounces of grated reduced fat cheddar 4 tablespoons of melted butter 2 tablespoons of diced butter 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper all right now first preheat the oven to 350 degrees and spray a 9 by 12 inch casserole dish with nonstick spray to make the cream of chicken soup in a small saucepan add the evaporated skim milk and the bouillon granules and stir over a medium heat until the bouillon dissolves and the milk just starts to come to a boil then add the cornstarch slurry and stir for one to two minutes or until the mixture thickens then remove it from the heat and pour it into a large mixing bowl to cool down once it's cooled add the onions cheddar yogurt salt and pepper and melted then stir to combine in a very large bowl pour the sauce mixture over the grated potatoes and mix until everything is well combined now pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish and dot the top with the diced butter which will help it get nicely browned on top bake it for 55 minutes to an hour or until it has the color that you want on top if the casserole isn't as dark as you want after an hour you could stick it under the broiler for two to five minutes when it's finished let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes to set and then it's ready to serve now this one has all the creaminess of a casserole with hash brown potatoes playing the leading role it's great with any meal so why wait for breakfast I initially had mine for dinner with some roasted chicken and a small salad but for all you breakfast lovers out there rest assured the leftovers were reheated the following day to make a phenomenal addition to this mid-morning feast I can't think of a better side dish with sausage bacon eggs or whatever breakfast fare you have in mind so give this one a try and leave me a comment to let me know what you'd serve it with and if you'd like to see this recipe in print you could always visit my blog and for additional recipes and tips to fit in with your healthy lifestyle visit my friends at feed healthy recipes com see you again soon
