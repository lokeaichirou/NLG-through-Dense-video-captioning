better so it's not that hard this is a simple spicy beef taco with guacamole simple to do for my eat fat get thin cookbook we have grass-fed beef you want is only the best quality animal protein not feedlot beef but grass fed no hormones antibiotics pesticides it's got more omega-3 fats more antioxidants better for you and taste better a little more festive but worth it and we have olive oil extra virgin olive oil by the best because it's full of polyphenols antioxidants it actually protects against heart disease and so much and it's delicious and then spices spices are critical spices have all sorts of antioxidants and any planetary compounds or phytochemicals with all sorts of powerful name compounds then get chilly here coriander cumin just makes a great beef taco but it's also really good for you we got black pepper and we have sea salt and we have some just delicious vegetables you tomatoes and onions and garlic which add all sorts of beneficial properties your diet cilantro which is a great detoxifying antioxidant red cabbage which is more phytonutrients and is also great detox fire and of course avocado is my favorite full of monounsaturated fats such a good for you and lines for the guacamole and making it tastes good and it's also good nutrients in there so this is all medicine all good stuff and great for you so here we go we're going to start and by the way you know I get a lot of my staples at a place called thrive market which is a fantastic online market it's a discount market where you can get all the best quality whole fresh real foods for twenty-five to fifty percent off the retail price I'll ship it directly to your door so I get all my staples nuts seeds spices salt pepper and all the ingredients I use for cooking really come from there and it's great I encourage you to check it out ok so let's get started we heat up a pan and we're going to start with olive oil you can measure it out I don't usually worry about measuring to my you know just kind of my ballpark coat the pan a little bit a couple of tablespoons or so of olive oil and you don't want to heat all about to hot because it can go bad it can actually go rancid and get damaged you want to just heat it up gently on the pan instead of just looking and not super bad and throw in the garlic and the onions and let it down for a bit and then we put in the beef and the spices delicious and amazing cooking is one of those essential simple tasks that we have to learn how to do if we don't know how to cook we can't feed our bodies it's so simple it's so essential you know what it's fun you get to play with your food I love to play with my food and you get to smell these awesome smells garlic onions and olive oils and my favorite smells so once the onions and garlic cook down a little bit you grab the ground beef and grass-fed of course and you just kind of put in here and then smooch it up make sure it's all smooshed up sometimes you can use your hog I sent I use my hands when I cook I play with my food it's kind of fun well you don't be touching anybody else after you fetch raw meat that's not a good idea total for that but just want to chuck it all up into nice little chunks and don't burn yourself I'm going to look down and put the spices in all the spikes that pre-measure we've got cumin coriander and chili all together then we sprinkle it all in here so we're just letting the talk let's cook up a little bit and then we're gonna make guacamole now I wash my hands in between and I wash the ball so don't worry we are going to make guacamole now people they know bok moly you're so hard how long you make wakka moly but it's actually pretty easy I'll use avocados a little bit of lime salt and pepper and that's it and here's my secret way of cutting the avocado it's great you don't cut your hands and then you take the pit and you can just notch it with the knife like this little trick pops right out I have to make a mess and then you basically scoop out the guacamole avocado into a bowl voila so you can scoop try it out and put all in a bowl I just make a couple of a cosworth and avocados just full of powerful in any disease compounds that are so delicious is so rich it's so creamy and you can use it in all sorts of things you can use it enough in smoothies you can use in soups you can make ice cream out of it it's awesome food and then we take some limes and we slice them up actually for the condiment right so we have a little bit of limes here for afterwards so we can sprinkle them on our taco and then we want to take some line and actually put it in the in the guacamole and I have my favorite little hand tool here everybody's all these fancy machines this is a simple squeeze there for lemons or limes I love it then you squeeze it all in there and squeeze the other one and we've got two lime juices in there and super-easy a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper and well you got guacamole and then you smush it very simple in your fork you can get a potato masher but it's pretty easy you just go chop it up mush it up and it takes a minute and it's all while the beef tacos cooking so you kind of maximize your time and you have every ready when the tacos are done in about three minutes we're going to have a taco so it's quick it's easy it's simple doesn't take a long time and it actually it's so delicious and so good for you and you get all the good quality fats from the olive oil from the guacamole and from the grass-fed beef which you know interesting has a far more omega-3 fats then then you'd imagine and because they eat grass and that's where actually wild animals get all their omega-3 is from eating wild plants and you know feedlot beef has no omega-3 and people epi has way more omega sixes which are inflammatory and are problematic so here you go you got your wok Amole so easy guacamole and then you actually spread it on the on the leaves and the way we make the tacos is we don't use flour tacos or torn tacos we want to reduce our grains as part of the eat packet in program we just have to take a little bit let me sort of spread it on here like a basic sort of creamy kind of filling for the taco on the lettuce wrap I like these a lot but you don't have to do so much and you know we pretty much have our tacos done it's so simple and we're going to take now the beef which is done it's ELISA ground beef and put it in here Oh yummy stuff here we go and then we just put a little bit of the ground beef inside the taco oh here we go and little bit in here there's a lot of tacos let's meet your whole family and you can kind of wrap it up at the end and you get to just get like a like a taco take a little cilantro we're on cilantro you tomatoes the tomatoes and easiest to cook it's not that hard even a doctor can do it imagine that and and then you take a little line and spritz it on that's it and lime and well I you got your tacos dinner how these use that and everybody's happy your family your kids happy they love it it's delicious and it's easy to make it's good for you so I encourage you to get in your kitchens take back your kitchens
