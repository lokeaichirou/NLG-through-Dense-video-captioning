 hey everyone its Julie today we'll be making generals so and now this recipe was given to me by my friend Jack's girl Fani from the cooking with Jack show Jack already made a video for this and you might think well wait a minute why would you make it if you already made it well before I recommend another youtuber to you guys I like to try their recipes and I thought this was so delicious it was incredible and this is what you can expect over at Jack's channel everything looks amazing please go check them out and don't forget to subscribe so now let's get started so into a bowl I threw in some cornstarch soy sauce and two eggs I follow this recipe exactly how Jack made it except the only difference is that I decided to use two eggs instead of one truly there's just one egg in there my camera didn't catch me adding the extra egg but trust me he got in there this texture was perfect for me and very easy to dip the chicken in I used three pounds of chicken breast and I just cut them into bite-size pieces make sure to coat each piece of chicken well and shake off any excess I fried my chicken in batches I use vegetable oil cook the chicken for about four to five minutes chicken came out super juicy and crispy on the outside and from now on I plan on flying all of my chicken this way I think all fried chicken should look like this color is beautiful and to be honest I could have stopped right here because these little chicken bites were so delicious but no worries I didn't stop I continued with the recipe I threw in some cornstarch water soy sauce minced garlic sugar chicken stock white vinegar and some white wine give everything a whisk and I will say that you should not eat this every day also this dish is meant for sharing that looks like my morning coffee bye and don't think I'm lecturing you guys for the most part I get really sweet positive comments thank you for that however once in a while a member of the YouTube culinary police likes to stop by and make sure that everything is healthy and clean and a skillet with some olive oil I saw taste some green onions and some dried chili peppers Jack removed the seeds I left them in that is completely optional I like really spicy food however the finish result was not spicy although general tso chicken is normally not supposed to be spicy I would say has a sweet and salty taste which is what makes us so good I poured in the cornstarch and soy sauce mixture and let it cook over medium high heat for about 5 to 6 minutes and before you know it it will be thick and velvety you want to toss in your chicken give it a stir let it cook for an additional 5 minutes on low heat and then it's ready to serve I serve this with white rice I did a season the rice because the sauce from the chicken will give the rice all the flavor it means I hope you guys give this recipe a try please don't forget to visit my friend Jack's channel make sure to subscribe for his awesome recipes and thank you guys so much for watching
