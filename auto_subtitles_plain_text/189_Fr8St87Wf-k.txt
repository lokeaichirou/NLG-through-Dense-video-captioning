 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make a very classic Tuscan soup recipe called minestrone here's what you need spinach carrots celery potatoes garlic onion fresh basil pancetta tomato paste chicken broth red kidney beans diced tomatoes short cut pasta and of course extra virgin olive oil salt pepper first thing you want to do is wash your spinach and just trim any big stems like that one I just trim it just because sometimes the ends can be a little bit too tough okay now I'm going to start chopping our vegetables I'm going to peel both carrots Caeser to just do this over a large bowl so you don't have any peels going all over your counter carrots are peeled now just kind of chop them I find it easier to just cut them in half just for my own safety and cut that in half and just do a nice dice cut down the middle next is the celery same thing you just want to cut it you want everything to be about the same size so that it cooks evenly okay just like that just little dices in the bulb next is your onion just a small onion define okay peel the outer skin is kind of tough and dry oops there you go like I said you want all the vegetables to be about the same size I just put two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil in a big soup pot and let it preheat for just a couple seconds and now I'm going to add my fit cup pinch it oh let that saute and get crispy it once it's crispy I'm going to remove it from the pan and I'm going to put it in my chopped vegetables I mean wow what a pen ten is crisping up I'm going to peel and chop my potatoes now depending on your signs you might need one or two so I'm just going to come one and see how much that gives me this is a pretty large potato well 1/2 and I'm just going to cut this a and then 1/2 well I think I think one potato will do pretty big just going to stick with 1 by 10 Chet it's nice and crispy understand take it out I'm going to add in my vegetables okay you wanna like you cook until the vegetables start to soften by four to seven minutes now while the vegetables cook we're just going to chop out my clove of garlic whack it with the back of your knife just makes it easier to get the peel off there we go and just give it a little chop just rock your knife back and forth okay that's good kind of add that with the potatoes so we can add the potatoes on the garlic with our vegetables halfway through it's been about three minutes since my vegetables start cooking and as you can see that the onions are starting to get a little common lines at the bottom at this point I'm going to add my potatoes and my garlic I'm gonna let them cook for another three to four minutes and you will notice that I didn't salt my vegetables I normally salt every element of the ingredients while I'm making a recipe but this time I didn't because I sauteed the pancetta in the oil so the pancetta very salty so there's plenty of salt left in the oil to give it to get the rest of the vegetables let's cook for about three to four minutes while I get my stock and my tomatoes ready it's been about seven minutes total not all the vegetables been cooking in the olive oil so now I'm going to just add in my 14 ounce cans a red kidney beans that I've rinsed and drained okay okay I'm going to add in a 14 ounce can of chopped tomatoes young okay I'm going to add in three cans of chicken stock okay now I'm going to add in about I don't know a big teaspoon full of tomato paste because I really like my minestrone to be very tomatoey I'm going to add that lid on for about 20 minutes me and me for about 20 minutes when it comes to a boil you want to add in your spinach and your pasta they all cook together and get really nice and thick and then at the end we'll season it so it's because of about 20 minutes now it's perfect it's just where you want it to be okay now I'm going to season it make sure your taste before you season with salt because I can set the pancetta is very salty okay and this point I'm going to add my pasta put a cup a short cut pasta okay and I'm going to add in a few leaves of basil okay and my pancetta when the pastas cooked just about a minute before it's ready we'll add our spinach I've been about 8 minutes since I've put the pasta in it's almost ready so now I'm just going to toss in my spinach now this will take literally a minute to wilt down you just want to work it in your pan ok give this about a minute or sell once it's all wilted you can see it the soup is nice and thick it's not watering the vegetables are all cooked I need to just plate it here we go here you have it and there you have it homemade Tusker minestrone it took no time to make and it's super delicious I hope you enjoy spending time with me to get this recipe and other recipes visit my website at www.att.com/biz you
