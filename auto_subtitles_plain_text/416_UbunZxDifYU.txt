 got some fried chicken going on there people curtsy a career path come welcome to my kitchen today quick uneasy well that's so quick what a flavor for did the ultimate Island style fried chicken let's get cool just about four pounds of chicken in here an entire chicken that I cut up into pieces and I washed it with the juice of a lemon and water drained it dry and I left the skin on there purposely because I love that little texture and everything else to the batter is going to hold on to that skin if you want to take the skin off you can certainly do that an entire chicken that I cut up except for the backs there's no meat in the back now we're going to marinate this first sir gonna go in with some salt some Caribbean style pepper sauce and this is where you're going to get a lovely little kick from some fresh ground black pepper we're going to go in with some Caribbean green seasoning in the description of the video below I'll have a link for how to make a Caribbean green seasoning and all it is it's a blend of all the different fresh herbs that we like using down in the Caribbean and the final thing I'm going to go in there with is a piece of ginger and I'm just going to grate in a little bit of ginger if you got ginger powder you can use that mix that up and allow that to marinate for a couple hours in the fridge as the oil a customer maybe over 4 or 5 cups of maybe four cups of vegetable oil heating in a wok and I use a wok because of the high sites prevent a lot of splatter from going on the stove so while the whole oil heat on a medium high flame I've got my flour and just all-purpose flour we're just going to season up sort of batter the pieces of marinating chicken with pinch of salt pinch of curry powder and we want to go in with a little bit of smoky paprika so all I'm going to do now is mix that up and then we're going to get to sort of coating the pieces of chicken with that just whipping a couple large eggs and a bowl here I'm just going to pour it all over that chicken and again you want to mix that really well I want to make sure every piece of chicken is coated in that egg mix so basically all you would do now is grab a piece of that seasoned and marinated chicken roll it around in the flour press on it a bit and then you want to tap it and set it aside for going into the hot oil with that final step of putting that beat in the cup of beaten eggs in there it's going to allow this flour to stick on to give us a lovely batter sort of batter for Friday's chicken I would do it in two batches because I don't want to overcrowd the pan so let's try one more piece there we go remember to shake off the excess flour and get ready to go into the hot oil the first batch is in the oil now going to give it about 10 minutes on each side on one side and you going to flip it over and make sure it's completely covered in the oil of the other side that is and let that go for about another 10 minutes or so I didn't cut up the chicken in two large pieces if your pieces are very large well then the cooking time will have to increase by a little bit but all you need to do now let that go for another 10 minutes then you will need some paper lined Bowl or plate this and as a trainer of the excess fat when you fish these out of here the first batch look at a lovely color I love them does the first batch is ready so I'm just going to remove it and put it to drain on some on a wire rack with some paper towels below just a soup just to get rid of all that extra grease on there the second bath is going to go in I just getting out the last batch yeah lovely car any more people Chris don't lead you guys wrong remember that only one wicked recipe that is an excuse I hear the denies the big pieces of chicken breast guys I don't do who the chicken we don't do the whitening kind of thing but so there we go friends wicked wicked wicked today is the ultimate Caribbean style fried chicken live and direct from Chris's kitchen a is stained by all I need is some ketchup I love me some ketchup with Fried Chicken Christian father come always a pleasure to have you guys here in the kitchen with me remember down below click subscribe all the latest videos are going to be sent to you it's such a pleasure having you guys here in the kitchen with me
