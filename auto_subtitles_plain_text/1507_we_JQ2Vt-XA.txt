 I find that the secret to light and fluffy scrambled eggs is to cook them over at low heat and keep them moving in the skillet and use enough butter to make them not stick and this will ensure that the eggs do not take on any color and that they remain Golden whisk three eggs in a bowl like this with a fork people add water they add milk they add cream for their scrambled eggs but if you're cooking in a pan the way I'm going to be doing I find it just if you have really good eggs you don't need anything in the eggs at all so basically a tablespoon of butter and a nonstick skillet and I'm get the butter so that when you drop a little bit of moisture in it it'll splatter don't use too large a skillet or frying pan to cook your eggs a little water like that off see it's splattering like that that's just as hot as you would need it so whisk them up put them right into the pan and just keep moving them around cooking them over low heat you want the eggs to cook and set but you don't want them to brown or get you hard so just stir around mmm this looks so good really perfect always put your eggs on a if you can a heated plate serve with toast or if you've English muffin and that's it perfectly good so delicious scrambled eggs
