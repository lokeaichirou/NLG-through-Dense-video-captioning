 Isis robbing from the willow room today we're going to make potato latkes it's a very simple recipe what we have is potatoes I've already peeled these you need five large potatoes and what we're going to do is grate these this is a box grater if you have a food processor at home with the grater grating attachment that'll work also so all I'm gonna do is grate to five potatoes okay we have our potatoes grated this is what they should look like they're gonna start turning oxidizing but that's perfectly fine we have an onion we're gonna grate this also this is perfectly acceptable to add that much of the onion left so you don't break your fingers off and there's our grated onion and you just throw this into the potatoes give it a little toss okay now we're gonna try to squeeze some of the moisture out of these you can press it through a colander I find that this is better this way squeezed all the moisture out of this you can see there's quite a lot of moisture in there wouldn't be good if we didn't squeeze it so our next step is crack our eggs about 3/8 here we're going to throw our garlic in there which is one teaspoon of garlic pour this over our potatoes season with salt and pepper and the third of a cup of flour I like to do is mix this first then incorporate the flower and that's basically it I'd let this sit for about five minutes that will activate the starch and the flour and some of the starch from the potatoes will come back together okay our oil is hot it took a little bit of our mix warming into a little cake like that drop them into the world some people prefer these to be flatter like mine to be I guess I call it a medium thickness [Music] I have this on medium heat you want to cook them on each side for about say two to three minutes if you will if you're still in these ahead of time and you have a lot of company you can't have the oven hot just holding in the oven that works mine okay this has been cooking about six to seven minutes and the pull them out and let them drain on these paper towels I have a paper towel you can tie some of the excess oil off all right what we're going to do now is just put it on this plate and a little sour cream and chives here you can serve it on the side or right on the potato pancake and can also use apple sauce which is very good too so that's it I hope you enjoyed until next time eat well thanks
