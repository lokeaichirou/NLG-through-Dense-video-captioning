 hi everyone today I'm going to show you how to make your own buffalo wings I am using chicken wing gits and you want to coat them in Lawry's seasoned salt you don't want to use too much because that's a lot of salt it may look like I'm using a lot but I'm not really using that much then you want to prepare your batter I'm using about a cup of flour a little bit of paprika a little bit of black pepper and a little bit of cayenne pepper oh and also a little bit of salt now I'm using sea salt because I couldn't find the regular salt and you just want to mix that in really really good then you want to get a ziploc bag and you want to put your chicken wings in the bag then you're going to add your flour to it and give it a really really good shake so that all of the chicken is lightly coated with the flour then you want to take it out and put it in a container or put it on a plate and then you want to cover whatever you put the chicken in cover with saran wrap and put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes one hour always do thirty minutes because I'm always ready to eat wow that's in the refrigerator you want to start making your buffalo sauce and to make that always use hot sauce I really like to use Franks red hot pepper sauce instead of Louisiana but I didn't have any then I use add pepper to that garlic powder melted butter and I stir it up mix it up really really good then I add celery flakes and parsley and then I stir that in now it's been 30 minutes and the chicken is now ready to fry I put it all in I try not to stack them on top of each other unless I don't have a choice and there's me and now the chicken is fried once it's done fry you want to put the chicken on a paper towel to get rid of all the excess grease because you don't want all of that on your chicken and then you want to add your buffalo sauce once you get it all on the chicken you want to coat the chicken you want every inch of the chicken covered in buffalo sauce or as much you can get covered then you can take it out and put it on a plate and it is now ready to be served I hope you try it and enjoy it and thank you for watching for the season wings you want to use some of the same ingredients hot sauce melted butter cayenne pepper paprika salt and mix it all up put your chicken wings in a ziploc bag and pour on the sauce shake it up really good set it to the side for about 30 minutes at room temperature and then put it in a pan and you're going to put in the oven on broil broil on high for about 15 to 20 minutes or until it's fully cooked and this is how it looks as you can see someone stole the piece of chicken and now left with two and this is the end results season chicken wings thank you for watching
