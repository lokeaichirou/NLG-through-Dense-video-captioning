 hello and welcome my name is random also known as our m2k dev today we're going to be cooking Japanese ramen so let's get started firstly we're going to add 2 cups of water to a pot then we're going to add 2 beef stock cubes now start a small fire and we're going to leave that pot to dissolve the beef stock get a larger fire going on another bottom and we're going to heat up some olive oil in a pan I'm using quite a lot of oil here because this is going to form the base of our sauce later now I'm going to season some beef by adding a lot of salt now this may look like a lot of salt but we're going to add extra here so that when we add the meat to our soup that's what will be the seasoning and now I'm just going to add some pepper and again we're going to be adding extra pepper here now we're going to add that meat to the pan I've spread this up so that you don't have to wait and once your meat is ready we're just going to take that out of the pan and leave it to rest now to the oils remaining in the pan we're going to add half of an onion that we've diced 1 tablespoon of garlic 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger and then Chili's a taste I'm using about one teaspoon here now just give that all the good mix and we're going to brown the onions and once your onions looking brown like mine we're going to add some Japanese barbecue sauce if you don't have Japanese barbecue sauce you can find it in the Asian section of your grocery now if you don't have any on hand you can just use soy sauce and add some chili and barbecue sauce to that now we're just going to mix that in and let that cook once it's mixed and hot we can take it off the heat and then move to putting our noodles into this stock that we created earlier now we can just leave our noodles and move on to cutting our beef so just cut your beef into some thin slices like I'm doing here I prefer my beef well-done but it's totally up to you what rarity that you use now that all of our ingredients are ready we can begin serving place your soup and noodles into a bowl just careful not to splash them everywhere then go and bring that meat and place that on one side of the bowl and add any of the juices that have formed from when we rested that meat back into the soup now get the garlic barbecue onion mixture that we created earlier and then spoon that on top of the beef and finally I'm just going to add some spring onion to this but here you would be able to add any sort of vegetables that you like or even an egg and there we have it our ramen noodles are done so if you enjoyed this video please click the like button also don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel and I appreciate all of your feedback so go ahead and leave that in the section below thank you for watching bye
