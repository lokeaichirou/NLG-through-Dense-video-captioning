 hi everyone welcome to another episode of cravings log I'm Karen are made and today we're making something that's delicious and healthy the Vietnamese spring roll I was introduced to this spring roll a couple of years ago by one of my co-workers that brought us in for potluck his parents used to own a Vietnamese restaurant and I was so taken back by the beauty of these spring rolls but also by the taste that I started to make these at home with many different fillings and my kids just love it now the plus point is it's not only healthy but it's also gluten-free which today is a big plus to have my sister-in-law is gluten intolerant and I'm always looking for recipes that I can serve when she visits me in the summer so let's get started I just want to go through the ingredients really quickly I'm going to make a very quick dipping sauce and this dipping sauce is also going to be used I'm going to use a little bit inside the spring roll just to give it a little burst of flavor so I've got about two teaspoons of hoisin sauce and I've got another two teaspoons of chili and garlic sauce and all I'm gonna do is just mix these two together now you can also use peanut butter peanut butter goes really well with hoisin sauce but since I'm sending this to my kids school for lunch I'm going to leave out the peanut butter I've got a fout a pound up regular tiger shrimp you can also use white shrimp I prefer my shrimp to be a little bit bigger but I just got a medium-sized today and all I do is put it in a pan with about a tablespoon or two of water and just let it cook it doesn't take a long time with a little bit of salt once that's done I take the shrimp out and I leave it to cool but don't throw the stock away because it has so much flavor even those two tablespoons of water has a lot of flavor in it I add some more water to that part and then I cook my rice vermicelli I've got about a cup or so of rice vermicelli and that just adds some additional flavor to the vermicelli next I'm going to add arugula you can add regular lettuce but I find it in google has a beautiful peppery taste I'm going to add some mint for freshness I'm gonna add a little bit of coriander I've got some chunks of cucumber just cut them in logs I've got some red pepper that I've cut into a sort of large confetti pieces I've got Julian of carrots and I'm going to add some crab meat now traditional Vietnamese spring rolls uses pork belly or ham I'm gonna opt to make this completely seafood only and so I think the shrimp and the crab together is a fantastic combination my kids love it now lastly we're going to use the rice paper I've got two sizes here I've got a small size and a medium size today I'm going to use a medium size which is perfect for school lunch or snack but the small size is lovely to make little appetizers so you can choose to use whatever you want I'm not going to talk too much about the quantity of ingredients today because I'm not too fussed about it you can use as little or as much as you like so I'm simply going to just mix the two tablespoons of chili garlic sauce together with the hoisin the lead this as is or you can add some freshly chopped coriander to this totally up to you just going to keep that aside and next I'm going to work on the shrimp so here's what you do take the shrimp put it down on your board take a really sharp knife and just cut it all the way through I'm going to do this to every one of the shrimp and you're gonna get to Hobbes like this which are gonna look really pretty in the spring I've cut all the shrimp and put it aside and now we're going to start by softening the rice papers here's my rice paper it's quite hard what you need is some kind of container that's big enough to hold some warm water now don't make the mistake of taking a really small container and trying to shove this thing in there i've seen some people do that it's just not a good idea so put it in and let it soak it only takes literally maybe 30 seconds or so to soften up and once that's done I'm going to stuff it up it's nice and soft I'm gonna take it out put it on my clean wooden board which I just washed now we're gonna stuff it so the first thing that's going to go down are the shrimp because I want people to be able to see it when they pick it up eat with your eyes so here's the shrimp you're going to use as many as you need to depending on the size of your shrimp my shrimp are big I'll use three but these ones are a little bit smaller than I plan to use so i'm going to use four of them i'm going to put in some arugula you can use regular lettuce but i love arugula going to add a mentally i'll stick a cucumber this is gonna add a nice freshness a little bit of coriander I'm gonna put in a tiny dab up the sauce not too much just a little bit some carrots I've got some red pepper confetti but this is quite a large confetti now this adds a lovely colour to the the voles I'm going to add a little bit of crab and finally some rice noodles just on the time and now the fun part we're going to roll it I'm gonna try and roll it without breaking it obviously this takes some practice but I'm going to fold it in just like I fold in a spring roll look how gorgeous that is and then I'm going to fold it over and we have a beautiful tight package that's just bursting with flavor now I'm going to keep going till I have quite a few done and ready for lunch I've got about ten done and I'm just gonna keep going I've got a fantastic momentum going I've got one soaking while I'm rolling the other one I've had a few along the way they are just staff delicious they're light and so fresh-tasting now remember as you're rolling it to keep wiping down your board because if you're bored gets really wet it gets very slippery and difficult to roll so thank you so much for joining me see you next time on creating vlog and please subscribe to my channel at youtube com / cravings blog hope to see you
