 g'day guys very easy recipe today you will need two snags now here I've got Italian sausages but are you can use whichever ones you want of course got some freshly chopped chives a coarsely chopped onion a bit of butter some potatoes have been killed and chopped up into smaller pieces some olive oil some milk some corn flour some chicken stock and a bit of salt and pepper now we're going to start with the gravy because it will take the longest because we are caramelizing some onions so into a pan I'm going to add some oil and that chopped onion and we're just going to let this cook on a low heat it's going to take about half an hour or so guys and you want to resist the temptation to stir it too often every five minutes or so should do it if it starts to burn turn it down if they take on a burnt flavor you have to start again so once they're caramelized I'm just going to put a bit of that chicken stock into a cup to mix with cornflour and the rest of it into the saucepan with the onions and once that's up to a simmer I'm just going to mix a bit of cornflour in with the cold stock and just add it in now guys and stir it for about a minute or so until it starts to thicken and then just leave it off to one side to simmer and cook down a bit so what's happening we're going to get those sausages started and we'll get into the mesh now here I pulled these potatoes for about 12 minutes or so they are soft and while it's still hot add that butter in and start mashing now we're just going to match this until that butter is melted all the way through it then we're just going to add a bit of salt a bit of pepper throw in the chives and just a bit of milk guys you're better off putting less in the start with and add more if you need it then put too much in the start with so just a little bit at a time and just work that through with the masher another point with mash is it's important not to over mash it so our gravy is done our mash is done and our sausages are done so ready to plate it up guys and there you have it it is absolutely awesome it's very easy to make you want to give this a go guys thanks for tuning in and I'll catch you guys next time
