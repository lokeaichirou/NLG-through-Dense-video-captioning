 hey dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah cooking we are making pad thai this is a recipe that's been requested several times it's probably the most famous Thai dish that most people have heard of it's a noodle dish we're gonna do some shrimp with it and I'm really excited to share with you have been trying to figure out how to make this to like recreate the first time I had it when I was 19 since I was 19 and I think I finally got it so I'm stoked to share it with you let's get just stir-frying all my ingredients perhaps that is super important when you're doing any kind of stir-fried dish because everything moves really fast once you get going on the heat so you want to make sure that you've got your me simply in plot or in place okay so for the sauce I've got some tamarind liquid tamarind juice tamarind concentrate this is what a tamarind bean looks like you can find these whole and a lot of like Hispanic or Latin markets or Asian markets and then you can find this juice in Asian markets also so using some of that if you can't find it for some reason you could use a lime juice but use a little bit less than the recipe calls for for the tamarind because it's limes a little harder so tamarind is very tart we're gonna balance that with some sugar and I should be using palm sugar but I'm using light brown sugar because it's a lot easier to find than palm sugar and some fish sauce and if you are a vegetarian and you don't want to use fish sauce I think that you can find vegan fish sauce that's like sort of flavored like fish sauce that doesn't have fish in it I think if not you could use some soy sauce so what we're doing here is like getting a good balance between sour which is the tamarind and sweet and salty which is the fish sauce I really like this red boat brand it's just made from anchovies it doesn't have any sugar or anything in it so it's just got a clean salty briny flavor just good combined and then we'll set that aside so I'm using shrimp like I said eggs are pretty much seen in every pad thai unless you're vegan and then I've got some fried tofu cubes I fried these ahead of time if you want to see how to press and fry firm tofu I did a video on that a long time ago with how to stir-fry so you can go check that out if you want to you've got some peanuts some bean sprouts so limes and then these are called garlic chives and they're similar to regular tribes but you can see they're really flat they're much more they much more look like a blade of grass and they're very pungent like they're kind of making the whole kitchen smell garlic and onion II right now so if you can find these use them they're very perishable so try to use buy them just like a day or two before you need them and keep them in the fridge just wrapped up in a damp towel because they'll get kind of soft and gross pretty quick or you can use regular science or you could use green onions and then I've got a shallot that I've thinly sliced and a whole lot of garlic and did I mention shrimp I don't know okay and some red pepper flakes okay finally the noodles so I've got these this is the kind that I like they're called rice stick noodles I like this size medium you can get them in any width from like 1/4 inch to all the way to up to a half an inch and I like something that's kind of in between that but they're flat and long and all I've done is taken half of that package and soaked it in some warm water for it's probably been about 30 minutes now so they go from looking like this like kind of translucent and a little beige to looking like this or there's more opaque and white and you want to just let them soak until they look like this and when you bite a piece like between your molars it feels a little like you're chewing on a rubber band not so chewy that you can't like after a couple bites like swallow it and chew it up it's fine but like the first time you bite into it it kind feels like you're biting on a rubber band so that's good we're just gonna let them stay in this water this water is cooled off now I'm just gonna let her stay in the water until we need to add them to the walk if you don't have a walk just use a really big skillet or even like a really big comb all you need something that's big because this is a lot of stuff that we're gonna be putting in here if you don't have a skillet or a wok that's approximately that size then you might want to just cut this recipe into two and you might want to have the recipe okay so we're gonna start out with this in high heat now a little bit of oil I'm using safflower oil but peanut oil is probably more traditional once your oil gets hot we'll add in the shallots and the garlic and fry those for maybe 30 seconds and in this case you do want the garlic to get a little bit of color on it and the shallots will get a little bit Brown then we're gonna add the eggs and just let them set for about 15 seconds and then start to break up the yolks and whites with your spatula so you end up with some distinct chunks of yellow and white and then we'll add our shrimp you can made this out of huge don't you shrimp or you can use thinly sliced chicken breast or chicken thighs instead we're gonna add the shrimp and cook that for maybe 60 seconds just until the edges start to turn pink and they start to get a little bit cooked we don't want to cook them all the way at this point and it will add the tofu if you want to add if you want to use tofu so after about 60 seconds of the shrimp here we're gonna add the noodles and I'm just gonna use some tongs to lift them out of the water and put them straight into the walk so that they're not drained totally dry we want a little bit of that water that they're soaking in to cling to them we're going to add the noodles we're gonna add however much the chili flake you want to use and then we're gonna add the tamarind sauce that we made and cook and stir fry this for about five minutes until the noodles are soft and al dente and then we'll add half of our peanuts half of our bean sprouts and half of the garlic chives and just stir fry that for another 30 to 60 seconds until the bean sprouts have wilted and then once all the sauce is absorbed and the noodles are soft we're ready to serve anytime you do Pad Thai the noodles kind of separate from the good stuff so kind of do a little twisty thing cute and then you can pick out you know if you want tofu or shrimp and you noticed I left the tails on the shrimp just because I think it looks a little prettier and then you just garnish it with more roasted peanuts and these I just crushed up in a mortar and pestle so that their various textures and piece sizes little peanuts maybe a little more fresh chives definitely some fresh bean sprouts and then stir in each bowl with a little lime wedge for some fresh sourness on top so there you go so if you like this recipe check out the how to stir-fry video I made a long time ago to see how to fry your tofu if you want to do tofu I also did a spring rolls video a couple years ago that would be a good accompaniment to this so let's well let's see how I did I'll tell ya so I don't know if you can remember have the noodles were before but now they're fully cooked still they always have a little bit of a rubberiness to them but that's part of the pleasure this is too big of a bite mm this was pretty much exactly like I remember the first time I ever had pet time in Boston when I was 19 and there's like one of the best things I ever ate my life and now I can eat any time watching
