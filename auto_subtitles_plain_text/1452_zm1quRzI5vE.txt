 hi everyone today I will make a popular summer kimchi young radish kimchi the kimchi all by itself is very delicious to eat with rice however it is also very useful in other dishes such as in peeping pop and noodle dishes once it becomes well fermented obtain about 1 and 1/2 pounds of young radish remove any bad parts and wash them several times cut them in to about 1 and 1/2 inch in length spread out a hand throw across the bottom of a big mixing bowl evenly sprinkle some coarse sea salt on top repeat this process until there is no more remaining radish I used about 1 cup of sea salt let it aside for about an hour meanwhile make some broth for the kimchi add 4 cups of water 1 dried anchovy pack 6 pieces of kelp and 1 dried shitake mushrooms once the broth start the boil cook for about 5 minutes and then remove the cap then cook for another 5 minutes on medium high discard the entropy pack and mushroom let it cool down pour 1 cup of the broth or water in a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of sweet rice flour stir until the flour completely dissolves in the broth cook on medium keep stirring it when the rice flour mixture starts bubbling and thickens it is done let it cool while you're preparing the other ingredients flip the learish pieces over a couple times but not too often so that they will get sorted evenly for better flavor and texture you have to handle them very gently after salting the lettuce for about an hour a liquid will start to foam gently rinse the radish twice and then drain chop the veggie ingredients combine the cooled rice flour mixture and all the ingredients for the sauce mix everything together add the drain the lettuce and chop the veggies into the sauce mix everything gently cutter container glass jar or about one cup of the Prada you saved or water inside close the lid but leave it on loose leave it out at room temperature overnight then store it in the refrigerator you will take one or two weeks before it is well fermented looks delicious and I cannot wait with some of this in my peeping pup and Pippin cooks ooh try some day thank you for watching - use no game bye
