 are you one that loves to eat calamari when you're out at a restaurant but you're super intimidated to make it at home well today I'm going to share with you some of the rules in preparing calamari first start at your fishmonger or your fish shop and make sure that when you purchase squid that it has a very nice briny aroma it shouldn't be fishy at all the squid shouldn't be slimy and the flesh should be firm in texture but not rubbery so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to take the tentacles in the head away from the body all you need to do is pull the body away from the tentacles so that's just like this here and the innards should come out with it and now part of the innards here is the the ink sack of the squid and that's really great at flavors risottos or pasta dough but we're not going to use it today and now to separate the tentacles from the rest of the head you're going to cut in between the tentacles and the eyes and your knife should be able to slide right through nice and gently we're going to discard this whole thing the tentacles now you want to cut away the long tentacles these are the grasping tentacles and there you have a beautiful thing of tentacles and then for the cavity or the mantle of the squid first things first you need to remove the cartilage which is inside and the cartilage is also called a quill because it resembles as you can see here a quill or you know a pen or a feather so this is tough cartilage it almost looks like plastic you want to make sure to get rid of this so now to remove the membrane on the cavity of the squid here you're going to pull away the flippers which are these guys here and this is how the squid steers itself in the water so all you have to do is pull them away from the cavity and the membrane that outer membrane should come away with it so now the last step is of course rinsing the mantle getting rid of any sand that might be in the cavity here and now we're ready to cut the squid into rings and make the most delicious calamari which is a lot easier than you think first what we have to do is cut the tubes into rings so I have a little bit of paper towel to dry off the calamari and you need a very sharp knife for this and you want to slice this into anywhere from a quarter to a half inch rings if you didn't want to fry your calamari like I am today you could certainly do so many different things with this you could stuff the cavity with a nice breadcrumb stuffing and braise it in a little bit of tomato sauce so today I'm using a very simple seasoned flour mixture for the calamari now it's all-purpose flour a little bit of pepper coarse salt paprika and cayenne but you could use anything in this mix you could use a little bit of old bay so just mix it together sift all of your ingredients again I'm using all-purpose flour but you could use rice flour that would create a lighter coating so this is mixed up nicely I have a neutral flavored oil here in my pot at 375 degrees so you want a high temperature to fry your squid in now I'm going to put in the tentacles here as well and gently toss the calamari in your seasoned flour mixture any residual moisture will help the seasoned flour mixture stick to the calamari and since the tentacles are a little bit bigger than the Rings I'm going to start with them and they're going to go right into the oil now whenever you're frying I like to tell people to do this make sure you don't overcrowd your pot because what it does is it brings the temperature of the oil down and the oil will soak into your batter or your flour mixture and you'll get a greasy calamari so don't over crowd make sure you are watching the temperature and it's staying at around 375 degrees and these fry for about a minute to a minute and a half so not a long time at all so it's been about a minute and a half and the calamari looks great it's a light golden brown color transfer to a wire rack as always when I'm frying I like to transfer to a wire rack instead of paper towels because I find if you put things right on the paper towels they start steaming on the bottom and your batter or your coating gets soft and soggy right when you come out of the fryer a little bit of salt and maybe some freshly ground pepper so there you go guys get this right to the table maybe with a little cocktail sauce and lemon now you know how to make calamari at home it's not so intimidating you have the technique and the recipe enjoy now if you have any kitchen conundrums seafood conundrums write in the comments section below or reach out to me using the hashtag kitchen conundrum bye guys you
