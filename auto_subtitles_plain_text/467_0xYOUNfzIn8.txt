 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you the perfect recipe for the most amazing chicken parmesan you'll ever have here's what you need just to make the sauce extra virgin olive oil crush peeled Italian plum tomatoes white wine garlic hot pepper flakes kalamata olives pick pitted if I can get it open here we go pitted common olives fresh parsley your also need fresh basil and of course salt and pepper now we're going to go to stove and start making the sauce now I have a pan preheating in a medium high heat ground drizzle and two to three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adding in my garlic that I've sliced thinly now chicken parm I mean it's it's a kind of dish that you know you've had it at least once if you go into an Italian restaurant it's really it's a huge to go to Italian meal it really is that and lasagna but there's I can think of but to me believe it or not it wasn't something I grew up eating when I was in Italy so it wasn't I wasn't sure how to get it you know adapt to it because I wasn't my favorites really bland just sauce and cheese so the way I make it is with just like lots of flavor in the sauce a couple different cheeses to just really bring up the flavor of the parmesan its all-around amazing just trust me make this recipe once and you'll forever be hooked now my garlic needs to cook for just a couple minutes just tell us slightly golden and then we'll add in our hot pepper flakes just so you know you should always have before you start cooking anything that can involve cooking pasta bring a large pan of um water to a boil so that it's ready for whenever you ready to put pasta in because it takes a long time for the water to come to a boil my garlic is almost there I'm going to put it in some hot pepper flakes I'm just going to go with about quarter teaspoon but it's all up to you depends how you like it how spicy you like it smells so good now I'm going to put in the white wine oh you want the wine to reduce you want all the alcohol to cook out so it's going to taste about three to four minutes you want to reduce by half and then we'll add in the tomatoes my wine is reduced so now I'm going to add my crushed peeled Italian tomatoes be careful because nothing splashes splatters like tomatoes I'm going to add two cans because I like a lot of sauce on my spaghetti and my chicken parm so you can always store this in the fridge for a few days put on some chicken breast toss it with some pasta a few days later you're good to go season it with salt pepper grab it yes I always felt with the pepper first and I don't know why here we get some saw nice just stir this for second lid on medium heat 20 minutes keep an eye on it but I'll take about 20 minutes and then you can continue the process while the sauce is finishing cooking and the water is coming up to a bully for the pasta here are the Romanian greens you're going to need for the rest of the dish chicken breast obviously pounded thin just like that all purpose flour eggs breadcrumbs granulated garlic provolone cheese Parmesan cheese mozzarella pepper coarse salt parsley basil you're going to need a splash of milk and of course you need spaghetti now first thing you do before we touch the chicken because remember if you touch the chicken I have to go right and wash your hands so get everything prepped before you do that we're going to put in a splash of milk and with the eggs just that beat them up just a little not too much perfect now I'm going to seize into my break bottom this is my little secret that I put in the breadcrumbs I put in granulated garlic just add more flavor beautiful and we're going to just salt and pepper the breadcrumbs a and the fiber remember you want to make sure you season every element of your dish so you get a nice rounded flavor so that every single layer is flavored the breadcrumb the chicken everything so just going to mix this around just a tad I'm gonna put in a little more garlic in the breadcrumbs I love it it's fabulous believe it or not it's subtle it's not very strong okay so here we go mixing this around now I'm using these pounded-out chicken breasts like that I buy them from the store like this but if you can't find them you can always buy about five ounce chicken breast and pound them yourself but every grocery store carries them so it shouldn't be too difficult it's perfect for slices amazing past one then we do eggs and the seasoned breadcrumbs you want to make sure everything is nice nicely coated here we go now I'm going to go wash my hands and go to the stove and start cooking up our chicken collards now I have a large nonstick to a pan for heating we've got three tablespoons of olive oil you want a nice and hot that's exactly what you want to hear it's over a medium-high heat I'm going to do batches of two because I don't want to steam the chicken I want to really get it nice and crispy so when I do this it takes about four to five minutes on each title it's nice golden brown and crispy and cooked all the way through chicken breast perfectly done crispy on both sides turn the pan off now you want to let you thread for about ten minutes while we finish our sauce and then we'll assemble the whole thing my sauce is cooked now for about 25 minutes now I'm going to add up some I'm going to add the chopped up kalamata olives and chopped up fresh basil and parsley as you can see this is not going to be just a regular boring old chicken parms and full flavor fresh herbs the one really comes through it's amazing turn this off because you don't want to really cook the olives too long otherwise they become really bitter and too strong but kind of overpower the dish and you don't want to do that the start of the dish is the chicken that's how it's going to stay turn this off i preheated the oven to 450 and now we're going to start layering I'm just putting in a little bit of sauce not much and I'm going to use my chicken breast like so just trying to do as best as possible so you can see and now I'm just going to ladle some of the sauce over the chicken just like so I'm just going to show you how I do one so that I can finish the rest of them now what I do is a tape Pro Bowl and cheese two slices okay then we top it with some fresh mozzarella and then we sprinkle Parmesan Reggiano all over the top oops like so I'm going to just finish the rest of them and I'm going to pop them in the oven till the golden brown and bubbly on the top here we go chicken parm out look at that top is nice golden brown and bubbly I'm serving it with a nice heaping helpful of spaghetti of course just like that mmm cheese is nice and melted it's full of flavor I wish you could smell this amazing little sauce right over the top a little fresh basil always and here you have it Tommy that doesn't look absolutely magnificent I hope you enjoyed spending time with me to get this recipe and other
