 I do and it's Kevin long from big night entertainment group and this is a this is something that I'm not super expert at but I try real hard this is some nigiri tuna and salmon so basically our nigiri the root of the word basically means finger finger of rice so we've got some prepared sushi rice over here and you're simply going to form the rice and put the fish over it we have some some super nice yellowfin tuna here the idea for a nigiri cut on the tuna is to really kind of take take the fish and you're going to cut it really at an angle so you can see I have the square block here I'm going to cut this at an angle your first piece you can use for something else you're just going to cut another thin slice to produce this sort of angled cut then we're going to do basically the same thing it's a little bigger piece with the salmon we're going to do that same sort of angled cut here produce these nice thin almost like bias cut pieces of fish so when you're when you're operating with your prepared sushi rice you always want your hands damp so that the sticky sushi rice won't stick to your hands you don't want to get too wet you just form this little little foot ball almost you don't want to crush the rice just want to form it fairly gently then drape the fish over it traditionally form and I'll lay that big nice piece of fish draped over there formed over the rice so it's that same little shape you start out usually kind of crush it a little bit people are usually scared to not crush it enough or you know to keep it together or they're scared that they're you know and they over crush it you want to kind of find that that happy medium there where your where your fish comes out your your rice comes out nice and sort of held together but not really smushed we try to do as much as you can with the one hand on the right so you don't pass it to the other hand it's the same thing with the tuna basically goes over gets a little form in gets turned around you're just going to get that right balance of keeping your hands just wet enough for that that rice doesn't stick to you I will spin around form in that so that basically the fish kind of drapes over the sides it's pretty simple but that is a that is basically how you put it together so a little nigiri of salmon and tuna so here you go I'm Kevin long the executive chef with big night Entertainment Group and this is a some simple nigiri of salmon and tuna
