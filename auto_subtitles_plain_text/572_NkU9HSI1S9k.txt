 a 15-minute Thai soup this is hot and sour chicken soup otherwise known as tom yum gai hi this is Jayden from steamy kitchen com what's so awesome about Thai food is that they combine many different flavors in one bite there's spicy sour savory sweet and in this soup recipe it has all of those flavors together out of all the soups in Thai cuisine this is probably the most popular soup this recipe is from everyday Thai cooking by Katie Qin the flavor of this hot and sour chicken soup comes from fresh herbs the first of these herbs is actually a leaf this is kaffir lime leaf if you tear this leaf in just a small place and and put it next to your nose oh my goodness the fragrance of this kaffir lime leaf it just smell that aroma is just incredible tear the leaf in a few places just to really so it can release all of its flavors and aroma but don't tear the spine of the leaf this way the leaf stays whole there is so much flavor and aroma in the oils inside the leaf and you want to make sure you expose that as much as possible the second special herb is lemongrass the lemongrass along with kaffir lime leaf together our quintessential herbs of Southeast Asian cuisine that give dishes a bright sweet and herbaceous flavor in aroma to release the flavors of lemongrass you're only going to use up the last six inches of the stock the leaves of the lemongrass have nothing to do with flavor it's all in the stock near the root most recipes will have you slice the lemongrass very very thinly or in this case bruise it so I like to cut it into smaller slices and then take the back of my knife and just kind of pound it a bit just to release all of the the fibers to loosen the fibers and release its flavors and oils I'm lucky enough to have a my growing in my garden both of these however you can find them at the Asian market and if you're nowhere near an Asian market here's your substitution take a line and a vegetable peeler and peel the line you're going to use the lime peel as a substitute for both kaffir lime leaf as well as lemongrass I like to bruise the lime leaf a bit as well before I throw it into the stock this helps release the oils and the flavors in the in the peel as well oh I forgot to tell you I'm using chicken stock as the base add a few slices of fresh ginger and a couple of slices of hot chili pepper all of these aromatics are going to simmer with the chicken broth for about 10 minutes and then we're going to scoop them out and discard them you might want to taste the soup right now if you like it a little more spicy add that keep the chili pepper in until just before serving and then you can remove everything so take a strainer and take out all of the aromatics all of the flavor has been infused in the chicken broth already now we're going to add the chicken this is a boneless skinless chicken thigh you can use breasts if you want but I actually prefer chicken thigh dark meat chicken in my soup another very very popular Southeast Asian seasoning is fish sauce there's unfortunately no substitute for fish sauce if you can find fish sauce at most grocery stores these days in the Asian section okay here comes the sour part of the soup this is freshly squeezed lime and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and then that's it I like to add fresh cilantro leaves in the soup as well and stir that in once the soup is done cooking there are so many ways to personalize this soup you can use shrimp along with the chicken or just use shrimp instead you can also make a vegetarian version by just using vegetable broth and instead of adding chicken breast meat and add more vegetables in also instead of using canned straw mushrooms use fresh thinly sliced mushrooms for the full recipe or you have any questions at all head over to steamy kitchen comm slash 146 of hearing from you so if you try this recipe let me know if you love my video recipes make sure you subscribe to my youtube channel thank you my brand new cookbook steamy kitchens healthy Asian favorites just came out I hope you have a chance to pick up a copy there is over 100 Asian recipes that are easy they're healthy they're good for you Plus tons of photos
