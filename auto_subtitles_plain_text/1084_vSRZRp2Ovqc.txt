 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with spaghetti carbonara which is I think gonna be a lot different than you imagine first of all there's no cream in it I think that's a later day invention but really this could be called spaghetti with bacon and egg sauce because that's basically what it is so I'm going to slowly cook some bacon in a little bit of olive oil on medium-low heat traditionally which uses somebody called guanciale which is a cured pork cheek bacon type product or you can use pancetta those aren't smoked I actually prefer the unsmoked flavor of the pancetta so if you can find pancetta or guanciale use that alright so we're gonna cook that until not quite crisp we want it cooked but not browned and crispy we're also going to add a healthy dose of black pepper by the way that's where the name comes from you can read about that in the post all right so while the Bacon's cooking I'm going to take two eggs some more black pepper did I mention that's an important ingredient some fresh Parmesan or pecorino romano cheese or a combination of both I think 5050 is perfect so we're going to put our grated cheese in there whisk that up and set that aside alright our bacon is cooked or hopefully in your case guanciale or pancetta when it looks like that we're going to turn that down to low as it goes and we're going to put on our pasta to boil now the pasta water is an important aspect of this sauce so we're going to use that water as the pasta cooks to finish this sauce so what you want to do and by the way I'm making this for two people so I have about six ounces of raw pasta in there so I'm going to take about a cup of that pasta water and add it to my pan okay and again that's just on as low a heat as it goes once the pasta is cooked I'm going to drain it and toss it with that black pepper bacon mixture by the way if you're wondering why that looks kind of dark I'm using a whole-grain brilla plus pasta which I love once that's mixed drizzle in your egg cheese mixture so you're going to stir in the egg it's going to hit that hot pasta and it's going to form a really creamy rich but not cream-based sauce alright as soon as that's combined like that turn off the heat throw in your cheese I'm using half pecorino romano half Reggiano parmesan mix it around and you're ready to eat so anyway that's my version of authentic spaghetti carbonara like I said smoked bacon not the best choice it works in a pinch but try to find some pancetta and I think you're going to like this even more without that smoky flavor it can be a little overpowering and if you want to serve of course a little more black pepper and a little grated cheese and by the way the name carbonara or at least the story I believe the name comes from all those little specks of black pepper look like carbon and since this used to be served to coal miners it all makes sense kind of a double entendre which is not telling it's French okay now I'm just confusing myself anyway all the ingredients are on the site if you want to give that a try and as always enjoy
