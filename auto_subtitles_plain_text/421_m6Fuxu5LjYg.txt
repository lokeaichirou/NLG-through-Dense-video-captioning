 hello and welcome to easy gluten free today we're doing Fried Chicken but not just any fried chicken today we're doing a crispy delicious KFC copycat and this recipe has been requested more times than I can count and I understand why since being gluten-free means you just can't run to KFC and pick up the real thing but today I'm going to show you just how easy this is to make it home now of course no one actually has KFC secret recipe nor do we have their patented pressure fryer in our home kitchens but after quite a few experiments with both the recipe and frying technique we've got a fried chicken here that tastes amazingly like KFC okay now in a bowl large enough to house a whole cut-up chicken add two cups of buttermilk and if you don't have buttermilk in the house you can make it yourself by adding a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice per each cup of milk add one egg a tablespoon of salt and about two tablespoons of hot sauce and don't worry contrary to how this looks this amount of hot sauce won't make it hot and spicy now whisk it all together and once it's combined add the chicken and I've got one chicken that was cut into eight pieces but the breast pieces were so large that I cut each of them in half so they cook at about the same rate as the other pieces now let the chicken soak in the buttermilk brine refrigerated for four to six hours or even overnight then to dredge the chicken we'll need to make a seasoned flour and for that in a large baking dish add 2 cups of gluten-free flour and today I use this rice flour blend but I'll put a link to my flour blend in the description box add one cup of corn starch and whisk them together now for the spices I'm adding 2 tablespoons of salt 1 tablespoon of paprika 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon each of onion garlic and chili powders ground sage and coriander old bay and black pepper now stir the spices into the flour mixture until everything's pretty well distributed and we can start dredging the pieces and to do that let the excess buttermilk drip from each piece of chicken then toss it around in the seasoned flour to get it well coated on all sides and place it on a wire rack now for the wings you'll want to tuck back the wing tips before dredging just like they do at KFC and when you have all the pieces code at once we'll coat them all again just dip each piece back into the buttermilk and into the flour again and once they've all been coded twice leave them undisturbed on the wire rack for about an hour so everything adheres really well and the chicken comes fully down to room temperature now to fry the chicken in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet heat 3/4 of an inch of vegetable oil to 350 degrees and I like to use a thermometer when I do Fried Chicken versus some other fried stuff because the chicken is going to be in there for a while so if the oil is too hot the chicken can easily get too dark before it's properly cooked and I like to start frying at about 350 degrees then try to maintain a temperature of about 320 degrees for the rest of the cooking time and you'll want to have a clean wire rack ready and waiting to drain the chicken now add the chicken in batches of four to five pieces at a time and turn the pieces every three or four minutes to keep them from getting too dark before they're fully cooked now the wings are going to take about 10 to 12 minutes and the other pieces will take about 15 to 20 minutes depending on their size and once you have a deep golden skin and an internal temperature of 165 degrees the chicken is done drain the pieces on a wire rack so the air can circulate and the skin will stay nice and crispy and this fried chicken is ready to devour and when you taste this and see how close to the kernels original recipe this really is you'll never have KFC envy again I mean just listen to how crispy it is this is some of the most amazing fried chicken you'll ever eat and if you'd like to print a copy of today's easy fried chicken recipe you could always visit my blog at the link below and for brand new recipes every week don't forget to subscribe see you again soon
