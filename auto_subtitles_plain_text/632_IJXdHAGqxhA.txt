 hi everyone welcome back to another episode of honeysuckle catering today we're going to be making Korean food and I'm going to be showing you how to make a really popular dish bulgogi after Vietnamese food of course Korean food is my favorite cuisine it's so comforting spicy it's so flavorful Korean food is a great social food to be shared with friends and family you're my family so let's get started so we can eat you're going to need 1/4 cup of soy sauce 2 tablespoons of sesame oil a tablespoon of brown sugar 2 tablespoons of honey a tablespoon of sesame seed a quarter teaspoon of red chili pepper flakes also called go-to guru 3 cloves of garlic 2 stalks of green onion a pound of sliced beef and half of a whole yellow onion in a large bowl combine your soy sauce sesame oil brown sugar honey and red chili pepper flakes mix them well [Music] now take your three cloves of garlic mince them well and add them to the bowl now cut your yellow onion lengthwise and set aside now take your green onions and slice them I actually have a really cool tool that'll shred them easily and make them look really pretty set aside a little bit of the green onions for garnish later and then add in the rest of the onions and your beef into the soy sauce mixture finally add in the sesame seeds and mix everything well with your hands this is your easy marinade and we're gonna pop it in the fridge for about an hour - I'd say five hours for the beef to soak up the flavors once your beef is done marinating take it out of the fridge take a heavy skillet put it on the stove add some oil and turn the heat up to medium-high you want to cook your beef in batches so that it gives a nice chart if you cook too much it's going to end up seeming the beef and it's not going to be very good [Music] and there you have it delicious bulgogi with the green onions that we set aside earlier top it to garnish it slow so good I love having it with rice thanks for watching another episode of honeysuckle catering I want to know have you tried making Korean barbecue and do you have a special way of making it comment below and if you want to see more videos in episode please subscribe above and visit my Facebook page for more daily updates and I'll see you soon bye [Music] delicious
