 this is Giancarlo Cal desi I'm Katie Cal Daisy author of this book the Italian cookery course and owner of our cookery school La Cucina Cal days in London today I'm going to show you an authentic Italian recipe today I'm going to show you how to make pizza margherita we've got for the base 500 grams of double zero flour 10 grams of fresh yeast but you could use 7 grams 1 sachet of dried yeast I've got 2 heaped teaspoons of salt 120 mil of water 200 mil of beer and the flours I've said for the topping I'm going to be using 400 grams so that's 1 can of plum tomatoes I've got a heaped teaspoon of oregano 1 heaped teaspoon of salt and some basil leaves and to finish some balls of mozzarella so to make the dough to begin with what I'm going to do is melt the yeast into the water and you can do this with your fingers just to make sure that all the little lumps of yeast are really well combined into it if you're using dried yeast what you do is scatter they're dried you straight into the flour as long as it's the easy blend version of it so I'm going to put the salt in there now make sure my yeast is really really well mixed up and there aren't any little lumps clinging to the bottom here so I can pour that straight in I'm just going to mix up the salt a little bit first then I can pour that straight in and measure out 200 mil of the beer beer gives it a really nice flavor and it also helps activate the yeast quite well so just make sure I've got enough in there so all the liquid into place and then using a dough scraper or your hands if you don't have a dough scraper just mix the dough together if you feel it's a little bit dry you can always add a little bit more of either water or beer and all the alcohol in the beer is cooked out so don't worry about giving it to your children right so now I'm going to get my hand in there just one hand at the moment so you don't get covered in dough and now I'm going to need it so you can see that it doesn't have much elasticity at the moment but you're going to develop that by the kneading so what I'm going to do is stretch out the dough fold it to trap the air in there and turn it right so once it springs back to the touch let's have a look there we are you think it's springing back to the touch so I know that I've needed it enough so it's probably been around seven to ten minutes but that's really going for it so I've got my lovely soft ball of dough I'm now going to cut it into four if you want to be accurate you could weigh these on a digital scale so you know that each ball of dough is the same and that way everyone gets the same size of pizza if this makes for pizza margaritas are now going to make them into little balls so if you say I've got a triangle here I'm going to fold in the edges here so I've almost got my little dough ball and then just chafe them like this moving my hands around them so that all the little crevices get tucked into the bottom and you get this nice even topping here now what we're going to do is rub a little bit of oil over the surface just so that they don't get a crust on them so I'm going to leave them for maybe about an hour really until they've doubled in volume and I can see that they're nice and puffy and ready so to make the pizza topping I've got some tin Tomatoes here I'm just going to mash them up using a potato masher into here I'm going to put the Oregon oh just over a heaped teaspoon of Oregon ax and a heaped teaspoon of salt as well the pizza topping should have a lot of flavor to it there's a couple of tablespoons of olive oil going in there as well so let's see how the pizza is done Wow that's risen up really well so you can see they're doubled in volume doubled in size and now what we're going to do is roll them out plenty of flour now and roll them out with a rolling pin and put the pizza on to the board and when you're doing this just make sure that your pizza is going to move around on the board all the time so now for the topping it's probably a couple of tablespoons and then spread it out over the surface of the pizza and always remember that less is more now I'm going to tear up I've got proper buffalo mozzarella here so a proper margarita pizza should be buffalo mozzarella it should be basil good olive oil good tomatoes and again you don't need too much cheese it's amazing how much it spreads so couple of sprigs a basil on top and it's ready to go in the oven just check again that you can still move the pizza on those word so I'm going to go to the back of the tray and slide Pizza run so in a really hot oven about seven minutes is right for the pizzas to be ready because it may take longer if you're not reaching such high temperatures and that's how to make pizza margherita in the Italian way
