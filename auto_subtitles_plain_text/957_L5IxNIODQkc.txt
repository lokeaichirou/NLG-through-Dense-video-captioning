 hi there I'm chef Eric Crowley owner of the culinary classroom in West Los Angeles and today I'm going to show you how to make a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict this also has different titles like a Norwegian eggs benedict or eggs Montreal what we are going to need is some hollandaise sauce a video of which you can see elsewhere on mahalo comm also some poached eggs you can also see that video elsewhere at Malo we have some posted English muffins some smoked salmon Norwegian pence Norwegian Eggs Benedict room temperature is absolutely fine we're gonna start off with our eggs after we wind up poaching them and we shock them in ice water and drain them we're gonna reheat them and we can actually use the same water that we use to make our hollandaise sauce with so I take my poached eggs I'm gonna slide them into my barely simmering water and they only need to sit in there for about 30 seconds or 45 seconds we're really just looking for the eggs bein there long enough to warm them up and take the chill off we don't want to cook them any more so it's really important that after the eggs come out of the water we have a trade that has some paper towels in it because we need to actually block the eggs dry if you wind up kicking the eggs out of the water and start to assemble your eggs Montreal or your smoked salmon Benedict when the hollandaise sauce gets onto the wet eggs is just gonna wind up diluting the sauce and getting it to run all over so eggs have been in the water long enough lift them on out get them on some paper toweling you know blot them dry but our smoked salmon on our toasted English muffin follow it up with the egg then last but not least our hollandaise a really nice change of pace from a classic Eggs Benedict the Easter is coming up this would be a wonderful brunch dish you could easily do many steps way ahead of time you can poach the eggs ahead of time toast the English muffins the smoked salmon only needs to be room temperature make your hollandaise at the last minute and that is a classic brunch dish smoked salmon eggs benedict or eggs Montreal thanks again for watching be sure to subscribe so you can get some additional information if there's a recipe that you would like to see me make feel free to send an email to requests at Mahalo com thanks again and I'll see you soon
