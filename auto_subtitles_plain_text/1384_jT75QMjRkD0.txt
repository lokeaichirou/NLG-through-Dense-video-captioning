 hello namaste Salam alaikum sorry akahl welcome back to another session with your wash of Arabic um yesterday we made tiny which is a very strong sesame seed flavor and I loved it very much but today we're going to make hummus this is also another dipping sauce which you can use as a spread or you can just eat it just like that difference let's go ahead and learn how much lot of people at tiny to make this hummus but if you do not have any you can just add 1 tablespoon or a 2 tablespoon of sesame seeds okay just make the sesame seed paste and add into a blender in this add pepper powder salt lime juice garlic I love garlic any preparations I do if the garlic is there I usually add double the quantity of what a lot of people add so add garlic these chickpeas I have soaked overnight if you are cooking in a pressure cooker you can boil for 20 minutes or you know a couple of reasons like 5-6 results that should cook this chickpeas and I'm going to add some water these hummus you can make it thick or even little bit thinner so that should be good enough now this is a blended but a little bit coarse now add some olive oil that should be enough and I think I can add some more water now the thing is make it to the consistency you like I like it a little bit final some people like it a little bit coarser but you know you can blend it the way you like it and lot of people make lot of these Hummers and keep in the fridge sometimes they use canned chickpeas or even the bottle thingy I do not understand because when this is so easy to make just make little quantity just for the day and every day whenever you want to eat it make it fresh so you find it very nice and tasty look at this you can just have a spoonful of this or spread it over a chip or even a toast and then Wow fantastic and very tasty Wow tiny is nice rich and lot more flavorful but hummus has its own flavor and some people just love to use this instead of mayonnaise just the way I told you about tannic efference just the spoonful of hummus reminds me of those beautiful bellydance this Hamas may remind you something else to you but eat it and enjoy it but do not forget whatever is all about inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes and cooking tips at war ever calm so others can benefit from your great cooking thank you
