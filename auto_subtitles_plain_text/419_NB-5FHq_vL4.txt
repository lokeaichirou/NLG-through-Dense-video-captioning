 [Music] hey party people it's me Biddy welcome back to cooking with Dede I am so excited today's a great day we're going to make my famous fried chicken and let me tell you this fried chicken is very easy to make it's so simple however it is so good that it's going to knock the socks off anyone you make it for if you have a boyfriend it's gonna make it put a ring on it or if you make it for your family they're gonna be like oh my gosh this girl is just or boy I have to like put it out there to the boys out there who are cooking as well it's gonna knock everyone's socks off actually my son made this a couple weeks ago for some friends they went to a party and he made it they said it was the best chicken they'd ever had and yes mother's the best thing you can do for your kids is teach them how to cook especially your boys because a lot of those girls aren't cooking these days so anyway I'm gonna run through the ingredients we're gonna make this chicken and let's go okay let's run through the very easy ingredients you're gonna need about four pounds of chicken today I'm using drumsticks thighs and wings I have one pound of drumsticks one pound of thighs and about two pounds of wings then I will need about one and a half to two cups of buttermilk and this is three cups of flour and I have garlic salt black pepper seasoning salt and paprika that's it if you miss the ingredients which I hope you didn't it's so easy I'm going to show them to you now [Music] alright let's season the chicken I usually start with my seasoning salt and this is all to taste I don't really use measurements here so I guess just try to follow along with how much I'm putting in here so I just put a layer of seasoning salt over the top of the chicken and I'm gonna repeat this a couple times I'm also then gonna add some pepper over the top and since you're sticking this in oil a lot of this kind of cooks off the chicken so feel free to be a little heavy-handed on the seasoning then I have some garlic salt and again just a light layer and now I'm adding some paprika all right now that the top layer is covered washed hands I'm just going to run my hands through this and try to get the seasoning on all the chicken all right and now we're going to add more seasoning just wipe off my hands there a little bit you don't want the raw chicken on the seasoning bottles so I'm going to repeat this time I'm just going to start with the paprika then the violets lots and the pepper [Music] then the seasoning salt all right so I'm just gonna run my hands through this again make sure the seasoning covers all the chicken all the pieces here and you want to make sure before you start seasoning that your chicken is washed thoroughly I like to cut a little bit of the extra skin off and the facts all right so it looks like it's seasoned pretty well the last step to this is I take the chicken wing and I make it kind of one little piece I wrap the leg behind the back part of the drumette that way when you're frying it it just stays kind of like one piece instead of like the wing and the everything flying all over the place makes it easier to fry all right find all my wings in here now I did a little more wings than normal because my husband loves chicken wings [Music] all right almost finished here look for those wings that one's being a little testy all right looks like I got all the wings and I tuck those little suckers back here's a one all right looks like we're good to go all right now that you have the seasoning on it right my hands off you want to let the seasoning sit in for about I don't know 10 15 minutes prior to frying and you also want to pour some buttermilk over the seasoned chicken now the butter and the chicken when it fries it's going to make a big difference it's gonna be so tender and juicy all right so this little bugger didn't want to stay back so again in the seasoning with the buttermilk you want to mix it around and make sure that every piece of chicken is soaking in that buttermilk there all right that looks pretty good and just going to wipe my hands and at this point you're going to want to heat your oil and I like to heat it to about 350 380 and right now I'm gonna start at about 360 and I'm going to preheat the oil well all of the seasoning and the buttermilk soaks into the chicken and we will start flying probably in about 10 minutes after the oil is warm see you soon okay it's been about 10 minutes our oil has been heating up and now it's time to get the chicken ready to fry so in a ziplock baggie I have some flour what you want to do is put I don't know like five six seven eight pieces of chicken how many ever will fit into the bag I'm gonna do a combo of wings legs and thighs just kind of roll in the chicken around in the buttermilk here oh here's a nice little leg me myself I like the thighs my daughter likes the drumsticks and my husband likes the wings so that's why I choose these pieces of chicken one came apart so I'm not going to use that all right once you have a few pieces of chicken in here you're gonna want to seal it like so get the air out and then you're going to want to shake it up make sure that the flour covers all of the chicken in your bag if you just take it up just go back and forth upside down should coat the chicken wall with the flour now what you want to do is check and make sure that your oil is hot enough I like the temperature to be about 360 so you know when your oil is ready if you insert the end of a wooden spoon and it starts to sizzle let's check it out see if it's ready into the oil oh yeah there we go it starts to sizzle your oil is ready the temperature of the oil is very important in frying chicken it has to be hot enough but not too hot so that it burns a chicken right now we're at three hundred and sixty degrees all right so the chicken that I put into the flour I am now going to transfer from my bag into the pan look at that sizzle right away be careful you don't want to burn yourself the secret to great chicken is making sure that you turn it frequently that gets the ultimate Christmas and color on the chicken [Music] you'll see this is already turning a little bit Brown honestly you're gonna turn this chicken over probably about 20 times before you're finished with the chicken well this is browning on this side I'm going to go ahead and add some more chicken to my flour mixture over here it smells so good remember what I said a way to a man's heart is through his stomach and you definitely have to try this chicken [Music] so you have your pan that's prepared with paper towel so what you want to do kind of shake that grease off of there and stick it on your pan to drain the excess oil see the wings are nice and golden brown and very crispy finish I just wanted to show you what your chicken should look like as it's coming out let this excess oil come on stick it on your prepared pan nice and golden and crispy what it should look like [Music]
