 hey everybody welcome to the Wolfe pit today I'm gonna show you how to make crispy and golden fried calamari simple easy and delicious so let's get started I have some calamari rings here that I've patted dry on paper towels and these are actually squid rings a lot of people don't know that that's what they are I'm gonna simply season them with salt and pepper and now get your hands in there and give them a toss now give them a good dusting of flour and now get your hand back in there and give them a good mix to make sure they're all well coated shake off most of the excess flour and then drop into 350-degree oil for about one minute or until lightly golden brown after one minute the calamari is lightly golden brown so I'm gonna go ahead and pull these out and sprinkle the salt and you want to be careful you do not want to overcook these otherwise they're gonna turn into rubber bands now continue this process until all of the calamari is lightly fried in golden brown and there you have it fried calamari lightly fried until golden brown served with lemon wedges and your favorite marinara sauce thank you guys very much for watching I hope you give this a try and I'll see you next time
