 hi everybody and welcome back to cook and share we were in the supermarket the other day in the seafood aisle and we came across a really good deal on some fresh squid and we kind of thought hmmm wonder what we can do with this so we came back and put together a fried calamari with a mayonnaise lemon dipping sauce which turned out to be a really delicious appetizer so let's get started so what I've got here is some squid that I've cleaned by removing a tube in the membrane and I'm going to go ahead and slice it into rings also remember not to throw out the tentacles because you can use them as well now I'm going to begin making the coating by adding the flour to a container you can also use the ziplock bag if you length followed by the salt I like a little bit of a zip to mine so I'm going to go ahead and add some cayenne pepper if you don't like this you can simply leave it out some ground black pepper and I'm just going to mix this up until everything is nicely combined then we're going to add the squid in put a lid on and give it a good shake until all the pieces are fully coated next what I'm going to do is remove any excess flour by placing the squid into a sifter or colander and we're going to set it aside on a plate now what I have here is some vegetable oil that I've preheated so what we're going to do is give it a task by dropping some flour in and if it sizzles and bubbles you'll know it's ready then we're going to place the calamari in and fry it and batches oh I'd save for about a couple of minutes after about two minutes and the calamari is nicely golden brown we're going to remove it and set it aside on a platter lined with a paper towel and we're going to repeat this process for the remaining batches of calamari this is the sauce that I like to partner my calamari with so I'm going to begin by crushing some garlic into the mayonnaise followed by some freshly squeezed lemon juice now I'm just going to give this a mix until everything is nicely combined now this seems simple but believe me it's really good and there you have it our delicious calamari with lemon mayonnaise plate it up with some lemon wedges on the side for more details on this recipe visit our website and click to subscribe for more awesome recipes thanks for watching and see you next time you
