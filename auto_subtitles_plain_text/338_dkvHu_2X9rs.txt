 hi guys welcome back to cooking with Claudia today I'm making grilled pizza I'm gonna be showing you how I make the pizza crust from scratch and all so let's get started I'm gonna mix the wet ingredients I'm adding some sugar into warm water I'm also adding some olive oil salt and some yeast I'm gonna stir this in and set it aside I'm using rapid rise instant yeast so I don't need this to rise it just works instantly next I'm going to start mixing the dry ingredients I have some flour in a bowl see that I'm gonna add some Parmesan cheese and some Italian seasoning and mix that in very well and now I'm adding in the wet ingredients and I'm gonna fold this in to form a smooth sticky dough and again I used rapid rise instant yeast so this dough does not need to rise I'm just gonna cover this up with a plastic wrap and set it aside for about 10 minutes and then I'm gonna transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and work it with my hands next I'm going to cut the dough into two equal house and then need each housing to a flat surface and kind of shape it like that next I'm gonna put the dough on a hot grill and grill each side for about two minutes on medium-high heat I'm gonna grill the other half as well and transfer them onto a baking pan and brush the surface with some olive oil next I'm arranging some sliced tomatoes on the top and I'm also gonna add some fresh basil sprinkle some Parmesan cheese over that and also some mozzarella cheese I'm also adding some turkey pepperoni some more basil I'm adding some chunks of cream cheese I'm adding some olives and I'm gonna sprinkle this with some mozzarella cheese and this is gonna bake in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes while the pizza is a hint I'm gonna make a delicious sauce for it I'm heating up some brown sugar into that I am adding some balsamic vinegar let the sauce boil and thicken up a little bit and set it aside the pizza just finished baking and it's looking so delicious I'm gonna garnish this with some fresh parsley drizzle the sweet sauce over it and this delicious pizza is ready to serve thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed spending time with me please don't forget to subscribe to my channel by clicking the subscribe button up here that way you get notified whenever I make new videos because I have more delicious recipes to come
