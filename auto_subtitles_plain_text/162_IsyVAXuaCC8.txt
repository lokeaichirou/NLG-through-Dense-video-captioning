 hello and welcome to another episode of and there you have it spring is a pause and we want to be outside and we want to be skewering up a couple of shish kebabs so I'm Armenian and we're going to be making some great armenian shish kebab along with that my dad's simple and easy rice pilaf so let's go you and there you have it now the first thing we want to do is we want to make the marinade for the meat and this is going to have to sit in the fridge for I like to do it 24 hours so what you want to do is prepare this around the time you plan on eating dinner the next day so first and foremost we're going to make the liquid portion and that's going to consist of a half a cup of red wine any dry red wine doesn't matter and then we have a one-fourth cup of tomato paste just toss that in will have a white shirt we're going to have some great times with that okay be careful now and then we have one-fourth cup of extra virgin olive oil and we also have two tablespoons of red wine vinegar going to be a little more careful this time than that one now we take our whisk right here and you just want to whisk that up nice and easy just like so so that the tomato paste sort of dissolves a little bit in the rest of the liquid then we are going to add two cloves and finely chopped garlic just like this and one softball sized onion finely chopped just toss all those at onions right in there and then you want to go ahead and give that a quick mix again it's going to be really oniony I'm really garlicky almost like a bit of a paste and the last thing you want to do is you want to toss in your spices I just mix them all into one bowl just toss that in and try to mix that up as even as you possibly can and then we are going to have one and a half pounds of either lamb which is the shish of the shish kebab so if you don't use lamb it's no longer a shish kebab it's actually a beef kebab chicken kebab you can use whatever you want then chop it up into little squares or you can ask your butcher and they can do it for you they'll chop it up into squares it's pretty simple you can get yourself a roast of some sort and just chop it up into little skewer size squares but anyway so you're going to toss that right in just like that toss it all the way and don't be afraid to get your fingers dirty because this is going to get dirty but I promise you it's worth it so what you want to do is you really want to mix this up as much as you can so that every piece of meat is completely covered and once you've done that just kind of settle it down in the bottom give your hands a quick quick rinse and we're going to cover this and we're going to toss it right into the fridge for a good 24 hours okay now that our marinade has been marinating for 24 hours we're going to actually start the cooking process for dinner so the first thing you want to do is get your rice started we're going to make a rice pilaf it's a very simple rice pilaf but very tasty so grab yourself about three tablespoons of butter you're going to toss out the pan and get it started okay you just want to bring that you know to a medium heat we're going to melt it but while we're doing that we also want a little bit of spaghetti just get like you know good I don't know quarter size of the way I judge it is looking at this angle here and that's about the size of a quarter right there and that's probably too much so I'll take just a tiny bit away from that but that's about right what you want okay and what you're going to do is you're actually going to crack this into tiny little pieces so what I like to do is just snap off the bottom so that the length of them are about that long about that long okay take a pork or whatever you want to do your met your butter is melting like that what you're going to do is you're going to mix it in just like this and essentially what you're trying to do is brown these okay now these are about brown they're about where I like them nice golden brown as you can see not burnt but golden brown so once they're at that color then you're going to add the rice I've got one cup of rice here and always with rice as I always say double the water so again use cold water if you want it to sit in the rice so we got two cups of rice our one right we're going to go with two cups of water since I have the noodles in there i'm going to add another cup of water for the noodles okay don't you want to do is bring that up to a boil so you want to turn that on high bring it to a boil as soon as it boils bring it down to a simmer cover it and leave it for about a half hour let's begin so I like to go here just all you got to do is grab a piece of meat stab it right through the center get it all the way you want to leave a little space there so that you have a place to flip these when you're ready to flip them on the on the growth and then it's up to you however you want I like to do an onion right up near there then let's go with the tomato right down the center how about another piece of meat just like that yeah get in there perfect then right down the center I'm not a huge fan of green peppers but they do add a nice color so I'm going to put one there just for color and then what we'll do is we'll do the same combination again onion tomato and one more piece of meat right on the skewer that seems to be just about right enough space where you can spin it like that we're going to do the whole set pretty simple I'll see you back here when we're done with that ok I'll rice is looking good starting to look really nice I gave it a little stir as soon as it came to a boil and I brought it down to a simmer and covered it I'm just going to leave that and the next thing now that this is hot and butter you just grab these and I'm just going to put all eight of these down right here so soon as this one side for about six to seven minutes after about six minutes or so I'm going to flip it over to the other side do about six minutes and then I'll just kind of rotate them to my taste I like about medium but some people like him well done some people a little rare but for me it's a good medium I do about six minutes on each side pretty much ready to go enjoy alright it's time for plating let's go grab your rice just like that it is done what we're going to do is we are going to scoop right down the center of the plate a couple of nice big scoops kind of even it out over the plate just like so now some people like to pull these off the skewer for the people i personally let them do that so i just pull them right off like that like I said I'm doing for foreplay grab two at a time don't burn yourself whoo smells so good turn those off Armenian shish kebab and my dad's rice pilaf mmm and there you have it you
