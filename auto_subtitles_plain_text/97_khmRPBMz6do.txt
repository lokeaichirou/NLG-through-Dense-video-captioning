 [Music] hi everyone it's April and Justin thank you so much for tuning in to cook with April today we are going to show you how to make spicy tuna rolls Justin took me to a like a sushi class right it was a sushi institute of LA and we learned how to make spicy tuna rolls so this recipe the credit goes to the sushi institute of LA so stay tuned and learn how to make it I'm not a pro like roller but you know it's all about the taste right so thank you let's get started we have to have to use sashimi grade tuna it's very important because of the freshness and the flavor and you're going to slice your sashimi grade tuna into the smallest pieces you could possibly slice it into you can even use your hands because the tuna is really tender and then you're going to place that tuna in a large bowl next you're going to slice some green onions then you're going to add some mayonnaise I have the complete ingredient list and measurements in the information box if you're interested so I'm going to mix the tuna and the mayonnaise together with a spatula then I'm going to add some chili powder mixture then I'm adding some chili oil because it is spicy tuna hoo-hoo so it's got to be spicy then I added some free Racha for another kick of spiciness and I'm mixing all those ingredients together with a spatula then I'm adding some of those green onions and I'm mixing again with my spatula and you're going to cover that with a saran wrap and let that marinate or sit in the refrigerator overnight or for at least an hour next you are going to work on your rice you must use short green rice or any rice that's labeled sushi rice and remember to wash and rinse your rice about four times and click your rice on the white rice setting now you're going to work on the flavoring for the rice you're going to add some rice vinegar then you're also going to add some sugar and you're going to mix the rice vinegar and the sugar together until it completely dissolves [Music] then you're going to add some salt again you're going to mix those ingredients until it dissolves once the rice is cooked and not too hot you're going to add the rice flavoring which is the rice vinegar sugar and salt and you're going to mix those together now you're ready to work on your sushi grab your nori and place a shiny side onto the mat where the bumpy side is facing you then you're going to add your rice and use your fingers to press the rice down and add more rice if it doesn't cover up the nori sheet and then you're going to add some sesame seeds just sprinkle it lightly or add more if you like you're going to flip it over and make sure you cover your sushi mat with a saran wrap because it'll keep your mat clean so you're going to place the spicy tuna mixture inside and then you're going to roll with your hands and a tip that I have for you is if your hands get too sticky like mine rinse your hands with some water and it won't be as sticky so you're just going to roll it make a caterpillar shape if you want I call it a caterpillar shape so I'm just going to press down and I'm using the mat to make it a perfect shape and it's ready to be cut you're going to just cut your sushi into about 8 pieces or so and if it's too hard to cut I like you I like rinsing my knife with water that's what I learned at the Institute so your sushi is ready you have wasabi and ginger and you are ready to enjoy okay so the sushi is set up it's on a nice plate the sushis there the gingers there wasabi soy stuff and the chopstick does this mean I get to try it yes so good and as you can see I have like a lot more ginger in Justin a little bit I could just like eat ginger ooh that eyes are closed [Music] well that is delicious it's yes so good yeah yeah you did a great job you know your traditional you're supposed to eat sushi and one bite right a roll yeah I was kind of challenging because he made it pretty big yeah I did I like myself there I saw a lot of right it is so good it's very tasty and I love this spice that you made it actually a little spicier than most like spicy tuna rolls I've had which I like oh yeah I did the chili powder and then I did the chili oil and then I was like you know what healthy love Sri Racha oh man it is so good thank you or anything well you should try some I'm going to try it later because um I look funny when I eat fish because like it doesn't fit in my mouth so I like falls you always look crazy so thank you friends so much for watching um stay tuned for the next episode of tasty Tuesday and I hope you like this recipe have a beautiful day [Music]
