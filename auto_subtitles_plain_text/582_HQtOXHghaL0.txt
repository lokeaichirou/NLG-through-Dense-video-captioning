 so we're gonna start with a pre-heat your oven to 350 we're gonna line a large baking sheet with tin foil like this which I've done and we're gonna start with garlic and onions but what I do it's a little bit different is i saute the garlic and onions first because it brings a lot of flavor this is what fantastic meatloaf so I have 1/2 cup of chopped onion 1 clove of garlic right here and I also have 1/4 teaspoon of thyme dried thyme leaves and when you saute herbs like that it brings out flavors even more so all right about a teaspoon of olive oil into a small pan like this 1/2 cup of onion in here and that 1 clove of garlic that I put through the garlic press and that quarter teaspoon of dried thyme leaves also goes in here okay so we're gonna saute this for about 5 minutes until it's like even a little bit Brown because this I mean if you put this in raw it just won't be the same you've got to saute it and cook it till it's nice and brown and by the way this meatloaf was in my cookbook this recipe people said it was the best meatloaf they've ever had it was the most popular recipe in my book and it's just really good there's quite a few ingredients but you just kind of after this you just dump everything in the bowl it's really easy so we'll give this about another four or four and a half minutes and we'll start to put it all together so after about five minutes it's going to look like this nice and browned and that's what you want we'll turn this off and we're gonna set this aside to cool while we put all the other ingredients together and pretty much everything gets dumped into a bowl at this point except the meat that's gonna go and last so here's my recipe all right it's a 1/2 cup of quick oats into a big bowl it's 1/3 cup of milk I like to put the milk in second to kind of soak into those the oats a little bit third cup of milk and over here we have a quarter cup each of finely chopped carrot I kind of shred the carrot and then chop it up a little bit so it's the quarter cup of chopped carrot a quarter cup of fresh parsley and these really really makes such a difference it's a quarter cup of green pepper and 1/4 cup of red pepper these the the red pepper is sweet the green pepper is tart it makes a great combination okay we're also going to add a half cup of ketchup right here that goes in half cup of ketchup one egg a teaspoon of Dijon mustard which I pre measure it already 1/2 teaspoon of salt some fresh pepper and this is the only way to do pepper okay and then we're gonna mix this up see these colors this first of all the oats instead of bread or whatever the oats add fiber and healthy fiber to this meatloaf and a great texture the peppers add antioxidants the green and red peppers onions and garlic are very healthy so there's really a lot of great health benefits to this okay that's all stirred up now all we're gonna do is put in the cooled onions and the ground the beef so the onions go in onions and garlic and thyme and this is going to I think I better put on some gloves for this it's one and a half pounds of ground beef and by the way I've done this with ground bison you know Buffalo which is very lean and no storm owns or anything it's really good you can't even tell the difference but this is one and a half pounds of the leanest ground beef I get this one I think has maybe nine percent fat okay so that goes in and now I'm going to switch to my gloves and we're gonna mix this all up now you want to get it mixed but not over mix it so kind of fold from underneath and and just stir it enough so it's all incorporated but don't overdo it because then it won't be quite as soft after it's done this just takes it you know maybe 15 or 20 turns okay that's it now it's time to put it on to that foil lined baking sheet that we did which is right here and we're gonna shape it into a loaf I just kind of dumped it on there and shape it into about a five by nine inch loaf and there's a reason why I'm using the foil lined sheet and not a loaf pan you'll see when this is done the fat is going to drain away from this loaf making it very very lean because when you use a loaf pan the fat stays in the meat and that's the fact that you don't want there's a little olive oil in there there's lots of flavor you don't need any of that saturated fat to make this really really delicious so I think that's it try to make it about even now this is going to go into the preheated 350 degree oven and the best the safest way to cook it is to know that it's a hundred and sixty degrees inside so what I do is I put a thermometer in this is one of those instant read thermometer you can test it later on when it's done but I have one that will continue to read I put it in the center of the meat like that and then I put it in my oven and this end stays out to taeyeon Tilly I'll show you in a second so this goes into the oven for one hour at 350 and then I have this thermometer that I plug this in to which I don't know if you can see and then that'll tell me when it reaches the temperature but again you can test this with an hour is pretty much it anyway but you can test it with an instant-read thermometer and after an hour wait till you see how beautiful this all browned on the outsides fantastic one hour okay the thermometer says it's 160 degrees and it's all done and it's absolutely beautiful look at this here to be pull-out food thermometer okay look at this awesome see look at that see that fat that's drained away that's all that saturated fat that causes heart disease you don't need that so the fat that's why you do it on the the sheet with the foil like that it's browned on all sides the end cut is the best part but you do have to let it rest for 10 minutes before you eat it so you know you have to just be ancient but when you try it if you don't think this is the best meatloaf you have ever had maybe you should take your meatloaf and
