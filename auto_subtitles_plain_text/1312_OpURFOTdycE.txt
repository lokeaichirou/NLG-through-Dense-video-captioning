 hey it's Dan McDonald the life regenerator what's up you asked for it you got it we're going to keep with these recipes that are real practical and inexpensive and simple to do and I'm going to have Darrow run you through this one so what are we going to do today sauerkraut alright thank you hi everybody its Dara and I am here with Dan the man and this is our first time making sauerkraut and it's not just any sauerkraut it's raw living sauerkraut not the cooked kind and the reason we're making it today is that you can go to the store and buy sauerkraut and if you can find the living stuff it's really expensive so we want to make you independent of all of that expensive food so I'm going to show you what's involved dan can you show them sure okay go ahead and start so basically I'm going to show you the tools that we need a sharp knife a cutting board we have a big glass jar so that we're going to put all the sauerkraut in here after the cabbage and all the vegetable ingredients are inside we're going to weight it down with a plate inside and glass of water a jar of water to push it down so we have as far as the vegetables you can use a lot of different things but cabbage is the main ingredient onion we have garlic we have daikon radish and carrots we're going to use a little bit of salt and that's it so first I'm going to show you how to properly cut a cabbage if there's an easy way to do it so you're going to kind of cut it in half first okay and you kind of take out the outside layer and I'm going to cut in a little v-shape to cut out the core and that's it and you just cut it in half like this and we're going to end up putting it in the Cuisinart with the shredding blade and I will show you so that's the cabbage I'm going to end up doing that one the same way this is the daikon raddish my favorite do you juice the entities oh you can okay cool I save them so I peeled one and we're going to end up Dan said he likes this one kind of sauerkraut that has little um slices of it little round disks so I'm going to use this little handy mandolin and I highly recommend using a glove to protect your fingers there are ways there are mandolins that have a little safety a safety guard but I like to do it this way so I think that's in the daikon by hand if you want to absolutely do it you can do all of this by hand you can just Finlay slice everything but for speed the Cuisinart does wonders cool so everything can be done by hand every great down my hand and so um so what we're about to do is independence raw living sauerkraut to make you independent of expensive raw food so what do we want to do first I guess I'll show you the radish the daikon yeah go ahead okay so we just kind of take it like that then you get these little pieces see and there's some more perfect ones you can get perfectly round once you get in the swing of it it gets a lot easier so then you make a whole big bowl of those and I'm not going to do the whole thing while you're watching we're going to cut this and then come back when all of the pieces are ready to go into please and iron is that we're going to do uh show them a little bit with the cabbage shred the cabbage okay show them a little bit of everything and then it will take a break and we'll chop everything up okay so oh this goes back on so this is the shredding blade it's goes like this usually the s blade goes at the bottom of the Cuisinart and this one sticks I couldn't figure out what to do with it when I got mine and I finally watched the video and there we go so it goes like that like shut and turn okay so all you want to do is this is the private times nine we have to do this a little bit thinner actually you can you can put put it down right in there okay there you go No so that's the cabbage we're going to do the green and the purple and then we can do the same thing with carrots shoma carrot I like to do this part so to sum it up what you do is you take everything that you see here and you shred it or chop it in any way that you see fit yeah so but basically we're going to just run everything through the shredder here so and then the one important thing that you need is a nice big bowl because you're going to put all the ingredients in here and squeeze them and let them sit with the salt so that they have juices and jus and when it's juicy that's when you can put it into the glass container so we'll get to that part okay cool so we're going to take a little break here and we're going to shred and chop everything and then we'll come right back so stay tuned all right back everybody and what we've done so far basically decided to shred everything in the Cuisinart including the daikon radish because it was going to take a little bit longer to make little mandolin slices so everything has been shredded it's beautiful it's colorful and now I'm going to add some salt probably about 4 teaspoons and the salt is going to help break it down and get the juices out of the vegetables so that there's enough liquid so what we're going to do is mix it now with your hands and gives it a really good mix and in about a half an hour this should be juicy enough so that when we put it into the glass container there will be enough juices from the vegetables to cover the vegetables so you want a little bit of liquid rising above which is why we're going to wait it down and push with the plate so that the juices stay on top so it stays moist and the premise is is that the vegetables are going to forget and their sugars and the vegetables are going to start digesting themselves so that the digestive enzymes are in play so we don't have to work so hard our body doesn't have to use its own digestive times to work to digest it so it's easy to digest and it's healthy flora so there you have it we're gonna let this sit and come back to you a little bit thanks Steve okay so what's next okay so what's next is that everything has been kind of marinated in its own juices between the salt and my really squeezing I got a lot of the liquid out of the vegetables so now we're ready to put it into this Josie how much liquid is down in there hey Dad oh good yeah it's work okay then I'm gonna fill it about three-quarters of the way full and you want to check it every day and if there's any foam or any mold you're going to remove it and depending on the temperature of the room you want to do it keep it store it in a dark kind of not too hot not too cold room and in about four days approximately it could be ready and you'll taste it and see if it's sour enough for you so you can always leave it to ferment longer and once you're ready you keep it in a sealed glass jar in the refrigerator and it could last for awhile and it's nice you'll have a lot for your family some people say you should be eating these things with every meal probiotics cool so let me see here we spent about ten bucks on vegetables and it's usually 10 bucks for a little jar yeah what's a little jar I'll show you guys a jar if we still have that here it is so this these jars right here are ten bucks okay so we just made about four ten bucks we probably made about six of those so so we've got six times our money's worth by making the sauerkraut ourselves and we're about twenty minutes into the process from the time that we started chopping the vegetables and then we she marinated it here with her hands for about five or eight minutes or so so it's really not as time consuming as I thought very really easy and you can you can just eat lots of it and not feel guilty that you're just you know wasting money and this helps you to be independent to be able to be a raw foodist and not have to spend so much money so we're really conscious about giving you some recipes that are affordable and accessible so I'm placing this right in here okay and I'm going to press it down so that the juices cover the vegetables and then you weight it with a clean large clean stone or a mason jar filled with water and it press down let everything's really covered with its juices so we can begin to digest itself yeah and then ideally I think that the jar would be a little bit lower we could have filled it a little bit less but you cover it with a towel and there you go and then in about four days it'll smell really funky and it'd be really good for you so I hope you enjoyed that anything else can I think you did a fantastic job I want to thank you so much for sharing this stuff with everyone I'm sure they really appreciate it I know I do I'm counting down the days till we get the grub on that stuff thanks a lot Darrell my pleasure see you soon everybody take care guys we love you peace
