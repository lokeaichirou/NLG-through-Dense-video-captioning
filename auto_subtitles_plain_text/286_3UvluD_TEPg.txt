 hi YouTube this is men and again welcome to my channel in this video I'm going to show you how to make the masala for masala dosa starting off with frying the the mustard the Bengal gram the dried red chillies and the curry leaves and ginger-garlic paste so heat oil in a pan first so I'm adding about two tablespoons of oil once the oil is hot you add the other ingredients and fight well before you add the onions and green chillies ok the oil is hot now to this I'm going to add the mustard seeds about 1 tablespoon of mustard then 2 tablespoons of split Bengal gram one spring of curry leaves 1 TSP of ginger-garlic paste also about 4 dried red chilies cut it into half fry well ring that's when you add the onions and green chilies to it okay that's right well now to this I'm going to add the chopped onion I have 1 big onion here which is chopped well and 5 green chilies which are slit lengthwise try this well for couple of minutes it looks like it is fried well to this I'm adding the chopped videos I have three potatoes here Jeff Jeff chopped well so to this I'm going to add the potatoes and fry for about a minute after frying the potatoes for about a minute and three cups of water and let it cook until the gravy becomes thick and potatoes are cooked I'll be adding 1 TSP of turmeric powder and salt to taste I'm going to add the turmeric and salt you can see the nice color of the masala as it boils now once the potatoes starts to cook it'll be good if you could mash it with the spatula to get the flavors out of it okay you can see that the potatoes well I want this water to get dried up a bit more so it'd be the right consistency to make the masala dosa this will be the idea of consistency if you want to have it with chapati so porous as potato masala so I'm going to reduce a flame and cook it in low flame for another two to three minutes until the water gets right and the masala gets a bit more thicker you can see that the masala is nice and dry and thick this would be right to make masala dosa I'm going to switch on the stove and then transfer this to a serving bowl and start making my Tosa for dinner okay now let's see how to make masala dosa so I described about this in my previous videos so one scoop full of batter and spread it evenly over the pan circular movements and then to this add the preferred oil am adding ghee to it once the process starts to get drawn just spread the ghee evenly all over the top a then we can see that it is nice and wrong at this point I'll add the masala to the center this is full full and fold it into half and transfer it to a serving plate you see how nice and brown it is
