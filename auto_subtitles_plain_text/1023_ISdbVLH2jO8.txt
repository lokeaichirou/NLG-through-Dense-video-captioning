 so I'm a member of this group on Facebook and it's for ninja owners and if you're not a member I'll put a link to it down below we need to go ahead and become a member that group that's full of awesome people and they're super helpful have great recipes and one of them today that we were going to try was submitted by a lady by the name of Lorri Lonard and I hope I said your last name right but she posted a picture in this group of the General Tso's chicken and it looked amazing so I said I got to try it so I went to the grocery today got what we needed and we're gonna try some General Tso's chicken so what you will need is roughly 2 pounds of chicken breast or unify the chicken tenders you're going to cut these in little squares I got the chicken breast is a dollar cheaper or pounds and the tenders but need two pounds of chicken need two packets of the general tso chicken seasoning mix and you can find this in your grocery in the Asian food aisle you'll also need some General Tso's stir-fry sauce find that in the same aisle and then you just need a little bit of flour and a little bit of oil and then if you want to cook it over rice you'll need some rice too I also picked these up here I might try to mix those in have a cup of flour and I've got my chicken and it's cut in about 1-inch pieces so I'm gonna put the chicken in in the bag and then shake shake it to coat the chicken okay so next I'm going to put the stove top for the ninja on stove top high and I'm going to add four tablespoons of oil inside the Ninja and warm it up okay so once your oil is hot and you will scoop out some chicken out of your bag and then and do the Ninja and you'll cook it on all sides okay so I have all my chicken in there if you have more than I would probably just do this a single layer if you have more you may cook some and then scoop it out and then go for Ian but we're gonna let that cook and I'm gonna pulse it make sure it's cooked all the way through okay as it cooks I just continue to cook thoroughly following cooking okay so after looking at this packet this is essentially making General Tso's sauce and each one of these is for one pound of chicken so and on the back you have to make it with soy sauce water sugar if it makes this packet we don't have soy sauce so I'm going to mix this up - the soy sauce because it's only 3 tablespoon and mix those two together and make our General Tso's sauce okay so I have my seasoned patent mixture here and I have my bottle of general so here I'm going to pour it all into the Ninja and the chicken nice and cooked brown so we're gonna pour everything in here and bring it to a boil okay so there I added everything in I'm gonna stir it up a little bit if that come to a boil again it looks like it is definitely boiling and we will turn it down to low and let it simmer until it starts to thicken up so I have my can of chop suey vegetables I'm going to add those in now I have drained them I'm going to mix them in here while it's simmering there we go get it all mixed up and then we'll let it all simmer for a few more minutes okay so cook some rice just real quick on the stove and here we go here's our General Tso's chicken thickened up quite a bit as you can see there we go looks delicious so we had a little modification along the way didn't exactly make the General Tso's recipe according to the plan but the combination of the one packet and the bottle of sauce was plenty of sauce and the flavor was great I mean it really had a good strong general tso's flavor to it the only thing I would change is probably put some more vegetables in there with it it was kind of just chicken and you know we added that little can of vegetable but I think maybe some fresh broccoli or something would be good cooked in with it other than that it was it turned out really good so give it a try let us know how you made it and if you like these videos give us a thumbs up and subscribe more videos coming - thanks
