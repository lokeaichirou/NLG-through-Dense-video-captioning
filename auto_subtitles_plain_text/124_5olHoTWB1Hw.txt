 hey you to the babies this is breaking and cooking again today I will be picking southern style macaroni and cheese with the twist because of any bread crumbs on top so let's get started first I'm going to boil some water as you can see I added some salt and I'm adding some olive oil okay now I'm clicking my noodles in and you're going to cook them to al dente which is what the pack is telling you doing with 6 min so you can go buy a package or you can be ghetto and country and games 1 the noodles and for a while if it sticks it's all detailed I know I'm brilliant but that's how it should look ok I have my three cheese's right here I have some Kobe Jack cheddar and some Velveeta okay now I have some heavy cream now I have about 3 cups I'm going to be Annie today then I'm going to add my house seasoning as you guys can tell and if you want to know what's in my house season seasoning just look down below and I will tell you guys what's inside all that season ok now I'm going to add three eggs to this okay now you guys you do not have to use heavy cream you can use milk but I wanted to use heavy cream because I wanted to do it you know the real fatty way because macaroni cheese is not supposed to be healthy ok you guys just because I had a lap dance don't mean I don't get down the empty unhealthy food ok so yeah so I'm going to mix all this stuff together like so and also you guys I did at sour cream I did not show that but yes I added about um not a cup of sour cream today and I have some pepper right there I have and some pepper smoked paprika right there okay you got a smoked paprika and I'm going to mix excuse me for using a plastic utensil but I'm a firm believer and not trying to mess up so many dishes because I am a messy cook so I try not to use all you know what I'm gonna add my changes to that um put all that milk in Caesars and is I'm going to add all that cheese to it you're going to mix so just continue to watch what I'm about to show you next is pretty much self-explanatory I'm just gonna be mixing all this cheese together with all I'm just gonna be mixing everything yep all right so just stay now you guys I did have to add some milk because I kind of made too much so I had a little milk but like I said this is pretty much pretty much self-explanatory this coming oh my now you guys are da Gries my hands a little bit of butter and I'm putting some butter through my noodles so they won't be so sticky speaking together he just made he has not all together for you now gonna add all the stuff that I've mixed together put all of it now I could put all this in a large bowl but I don't have one at the moment so I had to do it this way okay but I will prefer mixing all this in a large bowl and put it in your cooking dish whatever you want to call it that's how it should look and I am adding some of my house seasons on top and some I put some nice smoke Peplink on top of there too as well and I got some cheddar cheese and I want to sprinkle a little bit on the top just like he has a little bit on top I would have put a lot more but I wasn't thinking that I'll put bread crumbs on top of it because also add more cheese in the oven but I forgot I was a big bread crumb quick I use Texas toast croutons Four Seasons please me kind of yes honey this is is so good oh my god but I'm going to beat it all together like so you know this puts out a lot of English and I got some melted butter real butter y'all and you're gonna mix melted butter and the breadcrumbs together the kind of toast it'll toast the bread crumbs on top and I add had to add a little bit more books I did not have enough because you wanted to look like this the guys that's that bread crows adapt but I'm telling you it smelt so freakin good when I was making it together so good but you gotta put the bread crumbs on top like so see you guys I didn't put a lot of cheese on chuckles I wasn't think I was putting bread crumbs on top I was not thinking Irish the bread crumb on top and I was like a guinea there's a milk cheese in there but you gotta add it all over night so hang on pre-heat your oven to 350 and that is hard listen it was completely done doesn't look scorch it suck I had this in the oven for about 40 minutes what about me and guys look how good this looks it was so cheesy and and those breadcrumbs like really really did the job out those breadcrumbs dust on croutons or the bar so I'm going to cut into new just to show you guys hi look solid team yes sir a child yes but you see a big one per girl video right now something will catch on but this way look you guys and this is all we ate and just ate the macaroni and cheese laughter every chuckles Elvita but like I said you don't have to add all those cheeses you can add whatever kind of cheese you want but then feel Vita it's like the secret because it gives you that creamy sensation of a macaroni and cheese but just marinate all the way down this megaron cheese was a bomb but you guys my next video I will be making buttermilk French lemon pepper fried chicken now yum yum but you're gonna feel gonna put that will be my next video guys remember stay blessed thank
