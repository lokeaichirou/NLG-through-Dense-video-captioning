 okay here we have yellowfin tuna being cut for sashimi from shigeki see he's got 40 years experience as a Japanese chef sashimi chef this yellowfin tuna is caught off north coast of Queensland off Mooloolaba first cup is just coming in under the wings chops the head straight off he'll scrape he'll probably scrape the meat off that it's nice and sweet meat off there okay okay the the reason I when you buy sashimi you should be a little bit careful who you buy it off is it's not so much about the fish even though the best fish obviously works coil but it's it's more about the cleansiness okay Japanese chefs are highly trained in in in keeping their everything nice and clean and and keeping the bacteria nice and low it's must most important that the benches are spotless and the knives are spotless and their hands are nice and clean which is all part of their trade okay he's coming in he splits it down the middle on the blood line and come into the bone okay actually inside the fish there's no well there should be no dangerous bacteria until we introduce it that's why the knives and the hands I'm going to have to be spotlessly clean if it's not okay the bacteria is getting introduced to it and then we're eating it raw and that's where you have all the problems that's why you really should only buy sushi me or people that you can really trust that know their stuff okay comes along the backbone all right so that's that's one law in also have to be careful not to tear the meat you have to cut the meat away so you can get nice flops of sashimi okay that's one beautiful loin of yellowfin tuna okay then we'll get the other side we're only going to do one side of this hey you can see you just I'll turn that do it the other down the other way all right so there's all there's a bone that goes down the middle he just cuts through that around it and then along the back they're quite expensive fish so it's very important to get all the meat away yeah every yo bijelo fin as well the excess of $1,000 excuse my filming basically it's very important to cut the meat away not to rip it as you can see also once the meats taken away we don't wait laying it all over the boards even though the boards have been sanitized it's better to keep it all open I've got another beautiful loin place that over there and now here just scrape scrape the bones okay the meat on the bone is very very sweet and an ideal for sushi or or even even raw for sashimi very easy just with a spoon all right guys okay an expert sushi chef gets very little advice okay so we won't we won't follow with the other side okay the other side you just repeat the process okay so just move that away again most important thing to clean the bench down he's just getting some water the bench is cleaned down it's already has been sanitized okay so now we're just going to clean a loin up and cut a few blocks for sashimi all right normally cuts it into three pieces pending on the side of the fish this is only a small one okay the the smaller fish the light of the color usually the less oil there's also a lot of other reasons for less oil when the fish are caught they're caught on a long line and some fish are actually dead when they're bought in those ones there are very low grade we we stick with the live online ones with high high oil content which which gives us the best best-tasting sashimi okay there's a blood line the blood lines taken out it's just along the middle of the line okay that's that's removed and rolling away now we have the block so so then it's cut the surface is cut into two blocks the rest of it would be cut into blocks that row up for this just for the day we'll just take the top one off the rest of it you just skinned it and cut it the same way okay okay now we add the block and cut the block in half again all right he cuts he cuts it along the grain in it and then against the grain all right Japanese traditional style is probably a little little thicker than the Asian style or western style very sharp knife knife Sonia sharpened on one side and they just cut straight back one thing about Japanese chefs is their artistry and display it's all part of the display all right and there we go you
