Corin Gordon another day another meal yep another day another meal so guilty going out to eat for a living I never feel guilty about anything at all and what's the Wonder work we like to actually be a food critic sort of 365 days a year unimaginably good so much better than being a chef I can't any listen before Christmas it's really important I would love to have a food critic in the kitchen just to show you an insight or is like doing a full day's work and being up at 6 o'clock in the morning it's like saying that's nice aim to a policeman I'd like to spend a day in prison I know it's bad in there that's why I'm not in there as a critic what do you think the starter I've had better but then I have to have so much it's a great piece of program you know so it's a dead there from there from nice duck Tommy yeah they're Hungarian yeah but in terms of but in terms of the provenance of it it's nice to know at least it came from I'm quite enough to you about their sort thing there is a rumor okay but you weren't interested ones I'd actually asked the name of the pig before you get it yes I have done that but really the name of the farm will do and even though you you love for me you're more and more into this you've got something going on at home which is fairly sort of Hugh fairly written sources of Harmony I mean I live in the city I want my children to learn and and where their food comes from what's this for Turkey salute me that's right and why they got so much space run around and get what exercise exactly get fat and exercise surprise surprise Corden's had one of his fantastic ideas which I'm not exactly over the moon about he's decided that we are going to grow Christmas lunch he wants to make the children understand that Christmas lunch you know actually comes from somewhere not just from the supermarket so we're gonna fatten up the turkeys and grow our own vegetables but make I think you really attached them you know that Holly there we've tough old Birds I want to hear the noise oh no louder but if I go quick jump on corn quick jump and again jump and again jump they've got to be in this pen and we've got to keep them away from the foxes we got a problem in this setting with foxes because there's a lot of them around this woods behind and what we're gonna do is enclose everything with wire chicken wire and we're gonna bury that into the ground 18 inches who's gonna help me me my wants perfect garden but I've spent all summer having landscape gardeners he's now going to be ruined if you're naughty you're sleeping out here with the Turkish as well yes okay you understand what we're here don't you yeah we're gonna choose six of these birds to take home okay to fatten up for Christmas are you hungry what do I do one we have both bronze and white turkeys they're all free-range so there's very little difference in it the bronze are just a little bit game you're in flavor it's just personal preference really Chris needs six turkeys for Christmas the idea bring them here today was to sort of give them a sense of where they come from to make them understand that Christmas Day isn't just coming out of a supermarket Jack and we caught one yet come on we've got 4,000 turkeys here on this farm yes how old are they these are 16 weeks old is missing and they go right up to 24 of these will be about 24 weeks when what's the difference in weight will show the bronze turkeys from about 7 or 8 pounds oven ready right up to sort of 30 pounds around okay trim or whatever yeah good go turkeys need a diet which is rich in cereals and so we put at least 70% weight barley oats into the diet and that gives us a lovely finish and and that gives you a marvelous Christmas run today daddy's driving they're [ __ ] themselves hauling them welcome you home now we have to think of some names for them and I thought okay because there's six of them okay we got one each okay we'll name them after chefs okay yes yours is called Gary that's always spikey bum Gary yours walks a bit funny so we'll call him Jamie oh no look there is the stubble one down the end then one who wants to be on the lonely bird that's Delia what's yours called

meeting Turkey however yeah but y'all have got a so just make sure my turkeys are fine with you I can guarantee that the turkeys on fine order getting very plump and [ __ ] everywhere just just just just put it down to experience yo there's about this money any tips that you may have that I could pick up on to sort of I suppose make them feel a bit more at home just make sure they got plenty of room yes so plenty of food water and you let them in and out each day at in time okay right and maybe give them a bit more grass when they've eaten off all the graphs are that real pen you got me give them all gasps it's worth it so now I don't those plump breasts are gonna taste a lot better than more grass than my back garden sheets I written to you okay we don't cut yourself there you go nice
