 hello James here hanging out in the kitchen and today I'm planning on making an appetizer what I'm gonna make is a escargot appetizer so I've purchased a small can of escargot at a finer supermarket and you can also find puff pastry there it comes frozen so I've pulled some of my puff pastry out and then I'm letting it fall for about 40 minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna make some whipped garlic butter for my escargot and today I'm gonna do a batch using two sticks of butter I don't use precise measurements that's just the way I cook so I've diced up some garlic and I'm gonna put some garlic in the butter hence the name garlic butter and some parsley from my garden and I'll put some parsley in the butter so I put a little bit of low sauce in there use a seasoning salt I like to squeeze a little bit of lime into there so I'm just gonna use make sure I don't get any seeds too little corners a lime in there and that should do it and also I need to do is put my bowl in and I put this paddle on there lock it down start it off kind of slow I'm going to prep the escargot for my application and this happens to have a very easy opening top it's a lot of fluid it that they're in so what I'll do is all we're going to just strain them like this and I give them a quick little rinse off nice big escargot and I'll just keep them in the bowl like what andthat's cargo looks like this is a snail it's common brown snail in the United States they weren't so common before actually they were brought over by a French entrepreneur that was going to introduce escargot to the United States and they weren't ready for it yet so he went boss ended up letting the snails go and they became a species in the United States your garden snail is an ancestor of that French entrepreneur that brought the snails over now my wife is a vegetarian and so she doesn't eat snails so I'm gonna be making some mushroom stuffed puff pastry snacks for her using the garlic butter okay here we go my puff pastry has thought out it comes in a box folded up in thirds so I unfold it like this I've put it on some wax paper put a little flour underneath it and I'm gonna use a rolling pin and get a little bit more size out of it and I'm not going to over roll it I'm just going to flatten it out oh I've taken the puff pastry and I've sliced it into thirds I'm going to make one with the mushrooms and two with the ass avoiding cross-contamination of the escargot and the mushrooms I'm going to start out with the mushrooms first so I have made a little egg wash to help stick things together and I'm going to brush it along the edge of the puff pastry egg wash works like a glue then I will place a mushroom over here usually some of my garlic butter for the seasoning I'll just put a very generous dollop of butter on top of each mushroom now puff pastry's loaded with fat and delicious isn't good and this butter makes it decadent I'm gonna fold it over like so and just press it down as this stuff gets soft it gets a little harder to work with but we'll be good and just for a little show I have this ravioli maker and I'm going to locate the mushroom and kind of score in where the mushroom is you I'm going to go ahead and use the remaining egg wash for the top of the appetizers you it only took 15 minutes the appetizers are ready all this left to do is the plating we have put a little dish in marinara sauce homemade out of our garden and I'm gonna lightly brush the top of these pastries with some garlic butter or hot those are good I was a good
