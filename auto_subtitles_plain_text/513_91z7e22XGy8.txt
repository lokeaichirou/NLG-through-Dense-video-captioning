 hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with cheater perot e that's right i was sitting around thinking how can I make my polish grandmother roll over in her grave and then it came to me make this recipe so while this is far from authentic it is very pierogi like and very tasty so here's how you make it so we're going to boil some potatoes for the filling I have some Yukon Gold of course i salted the water we're going to cook those in till completely tender and while we're waiting we're going to take our cheese out of the fridge that is farmer's cheese read about that on the blog post for me it's kind of a cross between like cream cheese and ricotta cheese but very delicious stuff once the potatoes are cooked you have to drain them extremely well you don't want water in this and then we're going to mash those while they're hot and they really should cool down to just warm before we add the rest of the ingredients so smash them and let them sit there for about ten minutes to cool down while you're waiting you can season them with some salt some pepper some that's right Cayenne a little bit did my grandmother use cayenne I highly doubt it alright so ten or fifteen minutes later the potatoes should be just warm I'm going to throw in a whole egg and myfarmers cheese and once that's mashed together you are done and by the way Pro you can have a million kinds of fillings this just happens to be my favorite but what I'm showing you here today will work with almost any filling alright so once your cheese is mixed in and your fillings made I'm going to go ahead and wrap that up and refrigerate it I find it easier to work with cold but you don't have to you can actually start folding your pierogies right now if you want alright so the filling is done and chilling until needed that wasn't really the cheater part of this recipe that filling is actually fairly legit here is the cheating part that's right we're using round wonton skins for our pierogi dough wonton skins are nothing more than perfectly round perfectly even pieces of pasta it's incredibly fast and easy and again this is a cheater recipe so relax alright so we have our wonton skins I'm also going to need a little bit of an egg wash which is just a beaten egg with like a tablespoon of water you're going to want to lightly flour your surface I'm going to take a pastry brush or a finger tip I'm a fingertip guy go around the outside around the outside around the outside to moisten with the egg wash so the dough seals properly once it's been a gouache around the outside it's time to place down your filling all right I'm using a little sorbet scoop it's about 2 teaspoons or so and then just simply press the edges together to seal if you want to go and do the little fancy crinkle fold go ahead I don't bother because once these are cooked as you'll see they look great so I'm just simply folding it over pressing and that is it seriously it's that easy alright so you're going to want to egg wash fill in fold a whole bunch of those as many as you want to eat would be my advice and then to finish these are simply boiled for 2 minutes in boiling salted water and then they could be finished in any number of ways you can cook them in a little bit of butter that's probably my favorite way or is I'm going to show you now in bacon and onions which takes it up a notch alright so let's get in the time machine and go back about 20 minutes I took some bacon and some onions and a little bit of butter that's right we're cooking bacon in butter I'm using medium heat and I'm going to cook the onions and the bacon together and the bacon fats going to render and it's going to brown the onions beautifully and when your Bacon's as crisp as you want and your onions are nice and caramelized I'm going to push those off to one side and I'm going to evaluate how much fat I have because you need a couple tablespoons to fry these program so right here I think I have just about the right amount of course if it's too much you use the old paper towel trick and soaks them up and if it looks like you need more throw in another little chunk of butter nobody's looking all right I'm ready to place in my just boil pierogi and of course you're doing both these things simultaneously you have your pan of fixins next to the boiling pot so when your probes are done you're transferring them right into the frying pan it's a perfect system I'm going to brown those lightly for a minute or two on each side I'm going to toss it with the bacon and onions and that is one of the world's great comfort foods of all time alright you don't have to go crazy with the portion sizes 4 or 5 is plenty so I'm gonna place those on a plate a nice dollop of sour cream very traditional you can top that with some fresh dill or fresh chive and that's it totally fit make way way way way faster and easier pierogi and talk about a textural tangle in your mouth you got that crispy buttery crust and inside you have that soft luscious potato farmer cheese mixture just magnificent anyway there you go cheater pierogi sorry grandma but I had to do it one of these days I'll make the dough from scratch it is better but having said that these were super delicious and something I hope you try especially if you've never had pro-v before consider this like training pierogi so I hope you check these out
