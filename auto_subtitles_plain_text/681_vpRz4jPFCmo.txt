 give a welcome to Todd's kitchen today's recipe is a classic recipe but there are many variations out there so today I'm going to show you one of my versions that I guarantee you're going to love so join me today as I make my version of spaghetti and meatballs okay so we're going to start off by making our meatballs so into a bowl we got a place in our beef mince then today we're going to place in one brown onion that I've just roughly chopped up one peeled and grated carrot now finely chopped up parsley one beaten egg our breadcrumbs and our crumbled up better cheese now using clean hands of course I'm gonna get right in there and we're gonna give that a very good mix around just so everything is well combined and mixed through okay next I've got a bowl here with some plain flour notes that we're just gonna add in some salt and some pepper and just give there just a quick mix through okay so next I've got some of our meat and I'm just rolled it into a meat size sized ball so gonna place into the flour and what we're just going to do is just coat it in the flour just say it's all nice and coated just like that and just continue on until they're all done okay so now that we've made up our meatballs I've got a fry pan on a medium to high heat so tell me just gonna add just a drizzle of olive oil and then grabbing our meatballs I'm just gonna place them onto the pan and when I cook them for about say two to three minutes just until they're cooked all the way through okay so once you meatballs have been cooked all the way through it's just a super matter of taking them off the frypan and we're gonna place them into a container we're just gonna keep that container covered just while we work on the next step okay so now we're gonna make the sauce for a meatballs so I've got a pot on the stove on a medium to high heat so it's gonna add just a bit of olive oil and today we're gonna add in one onion that I've just roughly chopped up and a couple of cloves of fresh guy that I've also roughly chopped up I'm just gonna keep on stirring the onions around just until they're soft enough so should take about a minute or so okay now that the onions have softened up we'll just go adding a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste yeah I'm just gonna stir that through okay so next we're gonna add in our beef stock and a 400 gram can of diced tomatoes and it's gonna give that a very good stir through now I've lowered the temperature down to a low to medium heat and what we're gonna do is we let this simmer away for about 15 to 20 minutes just until the liquid decreases by half just so we have a nice thick sauce okay so our sauce is reduced by half and it's smelling fantastic so now it's just a super matter of returning our meatballs to the pot and just make sure they're all time of by our meatball sauce and we're gonna cover it up and let it simmer away for 15 minutes and in that 15 minutes these meatballs are going to infuse all their lovely taste and they'll finish cooking okay so Wallen meatballs are simmering away this is a perfect time to do our pastime so into a pot of salted hot water we're just kind of placing our pasta we don't bring this up to the boil when I cook this for about 10 minutes just until it's al dente it'll dente is not too hard not too soft but just right okay so these have been simmering away for 15 minutes and I'll tell you what these smell fantastic so I have to do now let's take off the heat and plate it up yes they don't play some delicious meatballs just onto our spaghetti okay so then if you left now is to sprinkle on some Parmesan cheese okay and these spaghetti and meatballs are done and I'll tell you what let's see how they taste as fantastic as they smell fantastic mm-hmm I can tell you with all honesty they actually taste better then they smell it really is a lovely lovely combination now I tried a number of meatball recipes in the past but I can honestly tell you out of all of them this one tastes simply delish and it was so easy to make now this recipe will easily serve for people so you may want to make a little bit more because I guarantee they're gonna be wanting to come back for seconds so thank you for watching this episode of Todd's kitchen a list of ingredients are down below as well as links to my Facebook Twitter and Google+ pages please do me a massive favour by giving this video a thumbs up and leave a comment and I'll see you next time for another delicious recipe you
