 every year millions of people come to the UK and they go out looking for what they think of as traditional English food and where better to get that food they think than a traditional English pub big mistake unless of course you want scampi frozen pies and sausages with God knows what kind of meat inside them now if you're comparing an English view to say fine French cuisine or maybe some Japanese sushi then of course it doesn't have the finesse with those cuisines but it has something different it has nothing in a smooth strainer see wine so these are really really possible carefully hats well once you speed now the last the potato into a sieve this is where the hard work is push the potato through the sieve into a bowl back to the spoon now the reason I'm doing this because it makes the smoothest creamiest mashed potato now obviously an easy way to make a potato is tomatoes until you can put a knife through them then you can drain them off you can just use a potato masher as know place it there there's amazing I'm not gonna lie to you I'm going to put a few ingredients in the shepherd's pie which aren't exactly what you'd think of as traditional but keep with me till the end you'll see exactly why dibs it's going to taste amazing first I'm going to use these of machining mushrooms which I need to soak first in some nearly boiling waters believe that on the side whilst we cook up some carrots some onions and some garlic sizzling away already in a frying pan on medium heat and just make a nice and sort of doughnut round water right now you cook down in onions in your camera next I'm going to do is adding a couple of good handfuls of button mushrooms and then time net a couple of sprigs and the way to get this off is just to push your finger from the bottom all the way up to the top and it comes off just like that and then just cook those mushrooms down but rounding off I'm just going to take out my coaching mushrooms which have been soaking now for about ten minutes nice and soft right so now that meats cooked I've got this out I'm going to add some Marsala wine into it and then porcini mushrooms chopped up these smell actually intoxicating a real woody and natural smell so a real richness to the source as well ennifer back on vegetables and this is where it starts to get a little bit more put so funky ingredient number one ketchup really really good flavor so give it a really good squeeze like that funky really number two babies couldn't get more traditional than baked beans you might seem a bit weird but other recipes that use tomatoes chopped tomatoes the baked beans just it has one now - trust me when you have it you see what I'm talking about next ingredients and frozen please check out the colors that's absolutely gorgeous then we're gonna season it a little bit more than your salt and then some oyster sauce another great really really good season and then we need to do so a part of the way put on the low heat leave it there for at least 20 minutes maybe half an hour we'll miss that oh yeah one thing I forgot is that we need to put a bit mushroom water from the chena mushrooms into it so just put a couple good gloves three in there definitely hot tuna on the seasonings good as well so we can make it up now okay our meats in here and if I want to keep the rest for another time I'm just free - no problem we're gonna mash potato if you made it into the middle then we're just gonna spread it to the sides now a mash is this screaming if you want to be really pretentious about it you'd call it poly Museveni but I just call it pretty much now I'll spread it all to the sides and once you cover the means sit check it out doesn't need to be too delicate then the next thing going to do is press and she's over it now I have got some mature cheddar which are perfect absolutely perfect exactly once you covered all of it with a really thick layer of cheese I'm just going to stick it under a really hot grill or five minutes until it's brown what best thing about this dish is you don't need to have with anything it's got everything you want right beside it and serve really nice golden color on top which is exactly how you want it and then just put a big healthy spoonful onto your plate like so get a little bit more means it's pretty good time just to garnish a little bit of pepper and they have no-nonsense delicious traditional shepherd's pie just the kind of thing a Shepherd Ward's Potteries had a hard day you
