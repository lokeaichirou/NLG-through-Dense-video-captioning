 okay today I'm going to be making a Waldorf salad now I find salads quite boring really so this is brilliant because it's got things like grapes and apples in which make it a really refreshing change for a salad so start off with your letter to make sure it's thoroughly washed onto the top and then just slice it into chunks okay so we have the lettuce and we just need to add in our celery and red grapes now again wash your celery onto the top I'm just using one here and then just slice that into trucks as well as mentioned it if you feel like you need any more of this any more of anything just you know add it in as desired I love red grapes so I'm going to be putting quite a few of these in as well and I also like to just chop them in half as well and the next is to get an apple now I usually put between half an apple and a whole Apple in depending on how much lettuce Heusen I'm going to use a whole one here some people like it's be sliced white thinly but I like it cut into chunks so I'll probably divide it up into eight ten pieces and then cut it into chunks like so just making sure there's no hips going in as well so another thing that makes a ward off side of Waldorf salad is the walnuts so you'd probably want about 150 grams maybe in this bowl of salad so just sprinkle those in as well and then just a drizzle of oil as well and to combine everything together you want to get yourself some mayonnaise and then just start mixing everything together and depending on how much you have you might just want to wash your hands and get your hands in there too zip now probably gonna add a few more grapes in there and possibly another Apple as well then once you're happy with the quantities of everything you've got in the salad just make sure everything sorry combined and the mayonnaise is kind of sticking everything together as I said add more anything you want obviously it's your own preference but um once you mix it all together it's then ready to serve you
