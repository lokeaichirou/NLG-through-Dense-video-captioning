 hello this is chef john from food whooshes comm with inside out grilled cheese sandwich actually should be called inside and out grilled cheese because we have cheese in the inside as you can see but we also have crispy crunchy caramelized cheese on the outside this is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich I'm gonna show you how to make it take some real butter melted in a pan you're gonna need a nice nonstick pan for this and I don't know why people try to spread cold butter when they make these things and they tear up the bread melt the butter in the pan much easier by the way there's only one choice for grilled cheese that of course is white bread check the ingredient label you want to make sure there's no fiber save your wheat bread for the turkey sandwiches and there's only one cheese extra sharp cheddar cheese I know I know what about American cheese I said there's only one cheese for this sandwich that of course is not cheese I'm using grated just because I had it but this will work with slices of cheddar also so we put our portion inside we flip the top over now that top was just in that hot pan so I'm gonna put some additional grated cheddar on top of that the heat from that butter is gonna melt the cheese slightly I'm gonna add a little more butter to the pan I'm gonna flip it over so the cheese is down and I'm gonna do the same thing to this side about a tablespoon or so of grated cheese and basically we're gonna toast that slowly I'm on medium-low heat you don't wanna go too high here you don't want the cheese to burn you want it to get crispy and caramelized alright so it was about three or four minutes on that side I flip it over so I can crisp up the other sides cheese and you can hear how crispy that gets it really is just truly amazing you know they have cheese that drips from the pizza and kind of burned onto the edge of the crust and it's all crispy and crunchy and delicious and everyone kind of you know maneuvers to get that piece this is like a whole sandwich of that effect anyway there you go inside-out grilled cheese sandwich I mean look at that cheese on the inside crispy crunchy cheese on the outside this thing is cheesier than karaoke night on Jersey Shore at one point I was let's just say involved in a group of cooks that we're not only hungry they partook in things that made them extra extra hungry they have given this grilled cheese sandwich their stamp of approval so you know it's got to be good so anyway go to the site there's nine ingredients its bread cheese and butter it's a technique but go to the site anyway and as always enjoy
