 hi guys welcome to Steve's kitchen today I'm going to be teaching you how to make fantastic falafels and stick with me because through this little series I'm also going to be making the pita pockets and I'm also gonna make a teeny sauce from scratch so let's get on today and make the best tasting falafels you've ever tried oh and by the way you'll need to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already if you want to see the other videos which should be coming up over the next few days now for the best flavor of falafel you want to take your dried chickpeas and just put them into a glass jar that's a cup of chickpeas so we cut the chickpeas at least a couple of inches above the peas themselves and we're gonna leave them to soak overnight or at least eight hours now you can use canned chickpeas as well and then work perfectly well just make sure you drain all the moisture out of those chickpeas before you start making the falafel okay let's get these pythons started we've got two cups of our chickpeas that we rehydrate it overnight we pop those into a bowl now the secret to really good for apple is lots of flavor chickpeas are not great on their own I mean they are good but look this is a whole big bunch of parsley and I'm just gonna chop that up roughly and that's going in the bowl as well it doesn't have to be done - finally I'm just gonna chop the whole order and pop it in it stalks and all actually not right down to the tough stalks pop that in with our chickpeas and flavor flavor flavor I've got four nice bunches here a nice great big lump of coriander or cilantro I think our Americans call it and again just roughly chopping those up we're just gonna pop those in this is really what makes the flavor the smell coming off that so I intro that coriander it's delicious and I've got two brown onions here that I'm just going to cut up roughly then it doesn't have to fine and into our bowl so now the onions the chickpeas and all the herbs are in there we're just going to mix that through with our hands now guys my big food processors not working at the moment so I'm going to use this smaller one and I'm gonna do mine in two batches but it doesn't matter flavor flavor flavor this is what's gonna make the difference all these herbs and spices just look at the colors of that now let blips that down you can decide if you want it really fine or whether you want it fairly coarse I prefer a fairly fine falafels I think it fries up better now guys look at the colors of that that is what falafel should look like it's coarse but reasonably fine it's packed full of flavor the texture is moist but reasonably dry it'll hold together nicely but we haven't finished yet I've got one tablespoon of coriander seeds whole seeds not ground down just pop those in there I've got I get it right this is one tablespoon of seeds that I've ground down to a fine powder coriander again I've got one tablespoon of cumin I'll come in as people call it pop that in there and one tablespoon of ground cumin a teaspoon and a half of regular salt and a really healthy portion of ground pepper now I'm using ground white pepper here but you can use ground black pepper either will do now why did I use white pepper you might ask because I've run out of black and white tastes really great anyway okay now take a spoon and we start to mix those spices in with the rest of our mixture here now I'll just show you now this is almost perfect but I think it's a little bit I don't know if I can if you can see that there but it's a little bit damp now the way to combat that and that's because the herbs had a lot of moisture in them is just to add about a tablespoon to two tablespoons of flour into this mixture so I'll sprinkle some flour over there that's one tablespoon I'll just fold that through and see if that's a now I think that's enough flour they're holding it together nicely they're still damp but let's test this one and cook it off now I've got a pan a deep pan with about three inches of oil here and I want to bring the temperature of this oil up to about 350 375 degrees Fahrenheit that's 175 190 degrees Celsius so I reckon that's around about 175 now I test it with a little bit of bread see straight away that fizzled up and that's going to cook nicely within 30 40 seconds that will be brown so that's now ready for the falafels just making Michel apples by hand I just roll them into a little almond shape and then just drop them into the oil okay once he's bubbling away like that I'm just going to use a slotted spoon to drop the rest of them in probably book 4 or 5 in at one time now if I just gently put a slotted spoon in there I mean look at those they're holding together beautifully they've got a lovely crusty outside I'm going to pop those on some kitchen paper and let them drain and I'm gonna cook some more okay I fried off my falafel they're beautiful and crisp on the outside let's just open that one up and inside you've got all that flavor and I can tell you that tastes delicious that's the best falafel I've ever had now we're going to take our falafel our salad our tahini sauce we're mixing all together making one fantastic meal okay guys firstly I'm gonna make a quick tahini sauce and I'm using the fresh tahini that I made earlier you can buy shop-bought tahini but fresh is best so I've got 1/2 a cup of tahini sauce there and I'm just going to cut up a lemon fresh lemon and we want the sort Li we want the juice in that lemon in the bowl first so I've got on my lemon in there and the keep all the the pith in there as well and put my half a cup of tahini then 1/2 a cup of water in there as well and now just take a fork and mix that through and then we just want to season it with about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of salt and I'm just going to add 1/4 of a cup of a thick Greek yogurt into the mix as well and then mix that together with a fork and we've got this lovely thick dressing that we'll be using in our palette all right to go with our falafel our little pita pockets we're gonna make a little fresh salsa now a simple salsa is often best we've got red onions fresh tomatoes and cucumber and I'm going to cut these up and dice them into little cubes so we've diced our cucumber our red onion and our tomatoes or tomatoes as our american friends say and then we're just going to pop those into a bowl together and then we're just going to mix those through now I've left all the skin on the cucumber as well it adds beautiful color there so we're set this aside in the fridge ready to use when artful apples are ready to construct okay guys we've got our pita pockets now and we're just going to cut a piece off the top and I've opened up the pocket inside now this can get a little bit messy we're going to take a couple of artful apples and pop them inside there drop them into the bottom and then we're going to take a spoonful of that shatter their little salads now so that we made and pop that in there and I want a big spoonful of the tahini sauce dressing and then another couple of falafel some more salad and again our tahini sauce over the top of that now you take a look that is a falafel that's gonna taste absolutely delicious so there is my take on a perfect falafel in homemade pita pockets with your homemade tahini now guys you can buy tahini from the shop doesn't matter pitas you can also buy but I'm gonna try this one now but not while you're watching it's gonna be messy so guys thank you for watching subscribe to the channel get over and watch the other videos
