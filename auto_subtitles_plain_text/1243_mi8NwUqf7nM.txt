 so she is originally a nigiri style which is sliced fish on top of rice therefore learning how to slice and prepare the pieces of fish is very important more than anything else this video is showing how to do this task prior to slicing the fish for nigiri sushi you will need to break down and trim the fillet to make it the best size to slice off cutting a big fish into smaller blocks is known as Sokka Dory which makes it easier to slice into pieces also what's the video about how to break down the whole fish for more in detail the majority of the nigiri recipes requires slices of fish which are about 3 inch long 1 inch wide and quarter inch thick but judge yourself when it comes to how thick you want to cut for example if the fish is chewy thinner slice will be better if it's very tender cut it thicker to take the advantage of the texture of the material all the fish has the grain within its meat when you slice off basically you need to cut against the grain if you cut with the grain the whole long grain will stays in a piece of sliced fish which makes it chewy especially if it's a hard senior like in tuna so trying to cut across the grain so that the short pieces of tissue is connected to the grain which makes it nicer texture the exception can be set only for the fish with softer and fragile flesh if you cut against the grain the meat can be easily broken apart so in that case cut with the grain to help the tissue keep firmly attached when you slice off the block with the opposite direction of grain you will be harder to cut if you change the direction of your knife so change the direction of the fish instead place the block with the skin side down the tail-end usually has more senior so if it is too chewy chop it off starting from the tail end use your knife to determine the angles to adjust the desired size when you stand the blade up it will make a narrower piece if the blade is flattened it will make the wider piece on the other hand when you set the knife blade in arrow to the cutting edge you will slice the shorter piece if he said wider it will make the piece longer the width and the thickness of the trains block are not always even all the way to the end so you need to continually adjust the angles as you work make the initial cut using the full length of the blade from the heel to the tip in one motion once the knife almost reached the skin side stand at the blade to cut straight down this motion creates the deeper cutting edge which looks nicer the more you practice the more evenly you will be able to cut off each slice of piece you
