 okay for those of you who ask and for my kids here it is pre-heat your oven to 350 and then dos start chopping your garlic and your onions if you're going to add them now if you have finicky children like mine were they may not like onion and garlic so you can just leave this first two steps out if you wish but I decided to trick my children and I started adding just a little bit of onion and a little bit of garlic at a time and I chopped it up very very good the smaller it is the less likely they'll notice it but they will notice the flavor and just think it's yummy so I just chop and chop and chop until I feel like I just can't chop anymore and as you'll see these pieces are very very tiny next step is the eggs and I like to use eggs from free-roaming hens and I've got to tell you one time my daughter and I were in the grocery store in the produce section and we weren't sure where the eggs were so he asked the produce man we said do you have any free roaming eggs and he was standing next to a cooler and he and he put his arms he stretched his arms out and put it around the cooler he said no I don't have any free roaming eggs he said I make all my eggs stay right here it was hilarious that we laughed about that for quite some time oh yeah you just saw me sniff those eggs I like to smell my eggs to make sure they're fresh before I add them to my meatloaf so just beat them up really good and then take a pack of crackers you know the kind I'm talking about those kind that aren't very good for you and just smash them up really really good while they're in the package in that way you don't have much of a mess you know because all the crumbs stay right inside of there I like to get these really really small because when you get a big piece of cracker in your meatloaf it just isn't good so make them really really tiny smush I'm good next is your tomato sauce I don't have a special preference I just normally buy whatever's on sale you can use whatever kind you want you just need one can and about a pound to a pound and a half of lean ground beef I like to use the lean stuff and there's less grease in there you know and it's better and healthier for you and I use about a half a can of the tomato sauce in the burger the cold burger make sure that burgers cold and a1 sauce probably about two tablespoons I just eyeball it the same with what's this here sauce about two tablespoons I guess just you know sprinkle it over the top but the trick is to a good meatloaf that melds together and holds together and doesn't fall apart is the meat must be cold yeah add some of this ketchup in here now all these liquidy items they're gonna help your meatloaf hold together and your onions and your garlic put that in there if you're going to and your free-roaming eggs and of course the crackers then you pour the crackers in now you're gonna mix this up you're not gonna mix too long that's the key to if you overwork the meatloaf it's gonna get warm from your hands and it will fall apart when you cut it so it's a little bit of garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste and if you're superstitious like I am but have a bad memory and you spill the salt I just pick a little up and throw a little over each shoulder because I could never remember which shoulder to throw it over so anyway mix your meatloaf and like I said don't play right in there too long just get it so that all the crackers are wet and mixed in there real good and then shape it up and put it in the pan just think pattycake hmm okay when I'm shaping the meatloaf into the pan I like to make a little well I press down with my hands to make a little well on the top of the meatloaf for later okay so now it's time to put your meatloaf in the oven and I like to cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil that way if there's any grease splatters it'll make for easier cleanup later and less chance for a fire so we set our timer to 45 minutes and then we go on and prepare the rest of our meal while we're waiting for our meatloaf to cook and today we're gonna have Dolly's famous potato pancakes okay some yummy garlic and onions chopped and lowery salt and then we're gonna put in some Jane's crazy mixed-up salt I don't know if you can get this in your town because when I first moved to Florida I had to talk my grocer into ordering this for me we haven't in Ohio but when seven years ago when I came to Florida they didn't have it but this is a essential ingredient for potato pancakes and of course more garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste and the key again folks is cold potatoes very cold that holds them together when they're cooking and they won't fall apart on you okay but again your potatoes must be very cold so if you have leftover mashed potatoes from last night's meal get them out and make some potato pancakes with them don't mess around in there too long just like with the meatloaf hurry up and make your patties and remember the temperature of your oil is very important and I like to use extra virgin olive oil just like Rachael Ray got to have something healthy going on in this meal and like I said the temperature is very important I try to cook mine medium heat okay so I just take a little bit of the potato the cold potato and I put it in the pan and when that starts sizzling I know and is ready for my potato pancake and now when I start to see little crispy things growing around the outer part of the potato pancake I know it's time to flip it so be careful at this part that you don't dumb and get that hot oil on you because it will hurt so just flip it over and looky there nice golden-brown potato pancakes I love them they're so yummy it's important to cook your potato pancakes in a Teflon pan and my daughter only has a small Teflon pan so I have to cook one at a time and I like frozen corn or fresh corn I don't really care for canned stuff so I'm heating up some of that as well all right now when your buzzer rings at 45 minutes then take your meatloaf out and pour the other half of that tomato sauce that you saved pour that over the top and cook it for another 15 minutes and voila we have home cooked comfort food don't want to eat this very often because it really isn't that healthy for you but it sure is good and it is comforting now watch how this stays together as I slice it and serve it on the plate it's all because it was cold when I started I'm starving let's go eat
