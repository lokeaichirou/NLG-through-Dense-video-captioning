 hey what's cooking this is chef Louise if I can cook you can cook you're watching wah-wah TV welcome to all my walk I am chef Louise if I could cook UK cook today we're making a very famous dish it's called Mapo tofu and in English is that any different it's just Mapo tofu so the ingredients we'll need today first tofu and that in Chinese is tofu then we're gonna need ground pork sweet drew scallion home and a very conveniently prepared Mapo tofu sauce and this is jose yeah you get these in any supermarket chinese supermarket mostly and there are different kinds you can try them for a different flavor i see which one you like the best this makes everything so much easier to prepare so all you need to do is first prepare the delft oh foo i'm going to cut the tofu into cubes and i'm going to do that just right in a dish with a knife cut into small pieces and make sure when you get the tofu you get the soft kind this is the soft tofu you don't want the firm one because we want this tofu to be like this okay so that is huge cubes but that's okay when you stir that if it's too small it's very easy to get that smooshed into even smaller pieces we don't want that ok and then scallion this is for garnish later I'm going to cut this small pieces like that for the coloring it's mostly going to look like pork and tofu so that's like white and brown so it's nice to get some green in there pork is already ground pork so that's I got the supermarket and you don't want to do anything else with a fork so there once the tofu in the scallions ready gonna get the look and we're going to start cooking so the walk is up I'm gonna start by heating this and adding cooking oil what I have here is some olive oil and i'm going to add that and let that heat up and while we're waiting for the cooking oil to get ready let's review the steps for this recipe so first cut the tofu into cubes and then hitting the wall / just what we're doing right now i'm going to fry the ground pork later then when you add the tofu add some water and then we're going to add the sauce the magic sauce then bring it to boil and that's done so that's the only six steps a very famous well-known Chinese dish that you can see almost any restaurant and you're learning to do you see how simple this legend has it that the name Michael came from the person who created this dish her name was smile and she created this tofu with her special recipe I'm adding the fork down and then became know as the dish using her name get compliments when portals don't be out load up so what I love to do is stir well and then separate the core so it's gonna make the chunks and small very small pieces you see the turning Carter very quickly you see some big shots just take the spatula and press and when it all to eat slower then it's trying to add a trophy all right adding the tofu right now now stir that with the four but be careful you don't want to accidentally cut all the tofu anymore that you already have make sure they stay like you okay what do we do next we asked some water and just one cup of water and it's always good if you have a measuring cup so that was for oil you get a clean one okay add this cup and now I'm going to get the sauce ready see how easy this is all the flavor is here packaged for you the one that I got is mildly hot Mapo tofu is usually hot so you can choose how hot how spicy you want this to be even some of them are not third riffs and are not that quite that hot if you can find in the supermarkets but my advice if you don't eat spicy food start learning to eat spicy food because really that's a whole different flavor you can have if you if you learn how to eat spicy ok I'm going to jam please mix the sauce with the tofu and with the fork and there's one more small package which i'm going to add later this is potato starch and that thickens the dish so it's not so soupy trine very wet very hard not to damage my tofu so far I think I'm okay alright so I'm plan is wait till this boils and i'm going to add potato starch should be soon this is already boiling so the final step is remember this secret recipe here mr. just potato starch so I'm going to add that to the dish to thicken it and what I do is add some water mix that together mix it well and add it shoot is she have here make sure you stir okay so once you had a potato starch gently stir and it's ready now I'm serving this in a big bowl and I am very sad to tell you that my tofu cubes that we started with at the beginning has turned into ground tofu you can see that well it's gonna take some practice for me and for you so just be prepared for that it still tastes delicious it just doesn't look like tofu cubes that's okay practice makes perfect now after you have this in a bowl now you can garnish that with scallion and make sure this is the last step because you want this gala to stay on top and it looks nice that way so don't mix it with garnish and there this is the very easy and very well-known recipe Mapo tofu and we made it in less than 10 minutes so here's the dish for today Mapo tofu and in Chinese mile pool though thank you for watching normal walk I am chef
