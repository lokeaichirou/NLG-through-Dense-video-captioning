 when I was going out we pretty much lived on shepherd's pie and cottage pie you know his lovely meaty stews with a fantastic potato he crust I still reckon a good beef cottage pie is just the ticket to warm things up for your family we actually start off with the veggies first of all you'll need a couple of browned onions finely sliced and a finely diced stick of celery sort a doze off with a little bit of garlic and some time in just a smattering of olive oil now once your onions are beautifully soften you want to set them aside for just a minute and grab yourself a kilo of stewing beef Oregon brisket and Chuck work really we'll throw in a bit of extra olive oil and fry the beef until it's really well Brown at this stage it's already smelling amazing i love a good college pie now put your onion mixture back in there and add a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste that'll start to stick with one on the pot so keep trying a couple red wine a liter of beef stock and let it simmer for about two hours until the meats tender but there is something just so satisfying about a beautiful stew now to turn this sauce into a gravy though we're gonna use a little trick the French call burn money a that's where you get equal parts of butter and flour about 75 grams of each you mix it together to form a paste then you add that about a teaspoon at a time whiskey as you go and it thickens up superbly it will need to simmer for just a couple of minutes to get perfectly thick but when it's done set it aside we get on to our potato crust grab yourself full medium to large-sized potatoes peel them chop them Stern it until it tender and then just mash them with 125 miles of cream same amount of cheese salt pepper and nutmeg the flavor throw a little bit of parsley in your beef mixture and transfer it to a casserole dish then top with the potatoes and a little extra cheese then you're gonna bake at 180 degrees for about 25 minutes until golden and crisp and the result is absolutely fantastic as always I'm rustic kind of beauty that makes it absolutely irresistible this is just the kind of recipe to start your own family dinner tradition
