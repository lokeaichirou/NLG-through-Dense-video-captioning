 you today we're cooking mussels I have got see what this is life rope grown mussels so what are we doing with mussels today something in a tomato base that's all I know I'm going to wing it and hopefully you'll wing it right along with me first thing I'm going to do get them out of the package you can hear that seal you don't want to unpack a cheese until the day or the hour actually a minute you're going to make them so I'm going to put them in my strainer and I'm going to make sure that these are very clean that they're all closed and get rid of anything that doesn't look right to me so in they go once I get all these cleaned and make sure that everything is off them like these little these little bits here want to make sure they're all gone cleaned and then we'll be back okay I'm going to put some oil on the bottom right pan get it nice and hot and I'm going to put some let me see when I'm going to put definitely put my red and white onion in there for sure I just look what yeah that much how much Oh and I'm going to put fresh garlic a tablespoon of fresh garlic I love garlic and we're going to sweat that for a bit and I'm Jessie don't want my garlic to burn just want to release some of that flavor so I'm going to go ahead and put 1 can of diced tomatoes in there liquid it all and I'm gonna bring that up now had all these muscles wanted to make them in a black bean but I didn't have the ingredients and don't have wine in the house and I don't have beer in the house and I don't have alcohol in the house never do so I thought well I'm gonna have to come up with something but tomatoes because tomatoes I have alcohol I don't why do you ask because I'm I'm just a nerd we're going to bring that up get it nice and hot and I want that liquid in there because that's what's going to steam the mussels so I want that quite soupy but I'm going to put some you see I have red pepper I'm going to put a little bit of red pepper in there just to kick it up a little bit a little bit heat I'm going to put some salt in there and some pepper a lot of pepper and I'm going to let those flavors just build alright put in some green peppers I don't want these to just melt down to nothing so I'm going to add them now not at the beginning and you don't want this to be a really super high boil when you put your muscles in you just you want to steam your muscles you don't want to boil all your muscles now I made sure that these are super clean took out any of the ones that were we're open anything that looked a little funny to me just tossed it and there was only three of them turn that up to maybe six without pretty quick so I'm going to turn that up and I'm just going to mix them around turn that up for sure seven in half I put a lid on it clear lid is great because then you can see when they're open when they're open they're done you don't want to overdo your muscles they'll get rubbery like an elastic band when they're done we'll be back all right let's take a look take the careful my friends ow oh wow oh that is beautiful perfect let's take this off the heat and let's go make it's finished I'm going to put some I'm so excited I'm going to put some pasta on the bottom any kind of pasta would be great oh this looks so good oh and this is pretty heavy so I'm going to have to put it kinda like this and spoon this beautiful ruffle I mean look at this before I even take it out of the pan look how beautiful that is Oh to die for so I'm going to put some mussels on the top and it may look like a lot but there's a lot of shell and that beautiful juice from the mussels comes out in the tomato oh it's so good I oh I could eat this every day you don't even have to have pasta on this you're going to get with bread French roll anything what beautiful dinner and in no time and I'm going to put a little bit of fresh sorry umm home dried parsley on here curly parsley oh my goodness that almost looks too beautiful to eat but I'm gonna include anyway look at how beautiful mussels and tomato sauce I suppose you can call it lovely just with ingredients that you have around the house no why no beer nothing fancy just stuff in your cover now that is an excellent idea and I have to try this because that I can't wait oh my goodness that is so good oh you have to try that till next time Hado you
