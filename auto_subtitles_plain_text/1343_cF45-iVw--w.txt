 hi and today it's really easy and it's quick to make it's really not that bad and why don't we get started so first thing you're going to need is pin it it looks like this in case anyone's not familiar with it looks like little tubes and you're gonna need to boil about three-quarters of this box so up to there I would say take you know in pot of boiling water with salt boil this down and this is what it ends up looking like and it's not like mushy mushy starchy I cooked it till it was not exactly identity a little bit more so it's a little bit hard but not so starchy and mushy so it's just the right texture what you're gonna need now is to begin is a half of a stick of butter and you're gonna put that in there you're gonna melt that with one medium onion finely chopped we're going to stir it for about five minutes okay so it's been five minutes and this is what our onions look like with the butter our finely chopped onions and you know they're not Browns but they look nice and soft and yellow and now we're ready to add our next ingredient which is a little bit less than one-third of a cup of vodka so anybody that you want to use you're going to let that simmer for about 4-5 minutes just let it simmer okay so it's been four minutes and as you can see you would expect there to be a lot more liquid with the onions but the vodkas pretty much all evaporated this is like a lot of the butter that was up in before and now we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup of tomato puree not tomato paste and not tomato diced tomatoes tomato puree and then we are also gonna add 1 cup of heavy cream stir that in all the ingredients together and we're just gonna let that simmer now for five minutes this is so super easy you know you're throwing in all your ingredients basically all the fit not all that it is is you're taking time for each group of ingredients to meld in with one another and you add the next one and then you're gonna have this fantastic sauce in another few minutes Wow so as you can see our sauce is now it's been 5 minutes and I've let it simmer stirring it every once in a while and it's beautiful beautiful red pink so now you're gonna have to add your final group of ingredients 1/2 a teaspoon of salt or more I mean it depends how salty you like your foods it's all a matter of preference a quarter teaspoon of black pepper or more if you like again and then the last ingredient which is Tabasco I'm gonna add about three drops but you can add more as much you like you can just you know put it in and then you try it and you see how it is so I'm gonna try it now for you guys just to see very good but again for those of you who like salt you may like to have a lot more salt okay so now I've got my pasta it's cooked I have my sauce everything is looking perfect here I'm going to add my pasta to the sauce and I am going to stir everything in together and the reason I didn't make the whole box of pasta and I only did 3/4 of the box is because I want there to be enough sauce for all of this penne here and as you can see it's so good so this is what our penne alla vodka looks like absolutely beautifully perfect and I'm sure it tastes that way too let's see hmm very good I really hope you enjoy it and I hope you'll let me know what you think if you try it and I hope to see you again I'm eating with your love
