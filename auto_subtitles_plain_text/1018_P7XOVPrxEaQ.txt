 so a peacock welcome to hot Thai kitchen today we are going to make green curry fried rice I know like it's like two really good dishes rolled into one and it is as good as it sounds so this dish in Thai is called Khao pad Genki one cow pad is fried rice and Genki r1 is the name for for the curry it's not super common but I've seen it done and so it's not like my original idea I wish it was super good and it's going to be really quick really easy it's a great dish if you've got just sort of curry paste sitting in the fridge and you don't know what else to do with it it's a great weeknight dinner so let's take a look at our ingredients so the first chunk of the ingredient is going to look very much like a green curry ingredient I've got some green curry paste this one's just store-bought okay and you can use more or less I'm using two tablespoons the more you use the spicier it will be I've got a little bit of sugar to cut the salt I've got some fish sauce and the fish sauce it is going to depend how salty your curry paste it I say this every time you cook with curry paste with store-bought curry paste always always leave room for adjustment for your fish sauce because sometimes it's very salty and you don't need to add any and sometimes just need to add a little bit more okay and then we've got some coconut milk just to give it some creaminess and lubrication we've got some Thai basil and we've got some really fine julienned kaffir lime leaves right here and that's going to be the citrusy component that's going to brighten everything up okay so that's everything that goes into the regular green curry sugar you can also use palm sugar you want it too so moving on vegetable so vegetables here I've got one cup of really whatever vegetables you want like it changes every time I make it depending on what I have I've got some carrots some bell peppers some onion and some guy lan or chinese broccoli and I sliced the stems thinly in the leaves I just kind of shift or not it and so you can use peas would be really great long beans cut up would be really good as long as there's 30 there going to wilt and look funny and anything that you would like in a fried rice you could totally do that just a combined total volume of one cup is perfect okay so that's that and then our protein I've got I'm using chicken breasts here you can use pork beef tofu whatever you can even do eggs if you wanted to so I cut this into small pieces you want the pieces of the chicken to comfortably fit onto your spoon along with the rice so don't do a big hunk and piece of chicken that's just it's not a practical fried rice size so I'm just going to marinate it in my soy sauce just a teaspoon or so all the details of the recipe is on my website if you want measurements and everything that's all there so just some soy sauce and I'm also going to put a little bit of vegetable oil I think it helps keep things moist and also when you add it to the pan it helps the chicken spread easier so they're not you know sticking together into a clump so we're going to let that go you can do this ahead of time but what I usually do is I do this before I start cutting my vegetables and by the time I'm ready to cook then it'll be ready to go so there's that and then finally the rice of course the rice so I've got some 300 grams of rice here in my pineapple fried rice episode I talked about five tips for cooking rice specifically for fried rice if you've got leftover rice that's great in this dish it's particularly important that your rice was not cooked with too much water and it's not too soft because there is coconut milk so our fried rice sauce is going to be a little bit wetter than normal so you know something to think about if the rice is already on the verge of being soft it might get a little mushy so you can also just put it in the fridge and let it dry out a little bit and then the coconut milk will rehydrate it perfectly so that's all our ingredients let's get cooking all right we're ready to cook I've got my wok here I'm going to heat it on just sort of medium heat when you saute curry paste you do not want to start it in too hot of a pan because you can burn the curry paste instantly if you think about it curry paste is just herbs that I'm tiny tiny pieces so they can burn easily so just a little bit of vegetable oil in there I'm going to go in with my curry paste I'm not going to wait for the oil to heat up because it's okay for the curry paste to slowly heat it's an easier heat control for me so there's my first time cooking in a wok with this new portable stove that I've got so we very interested to see how it goes might be a little hard for me to sort of touch the heat setting we'll see okay so I've got that sauteing cook that just for wow it's pretty powerful just for a few minutes just to get all the earths hooked up and then I'm gonna go in with the coconut milk and that's it calm it down a little oh wow Chili's oh by the way did I tell you this is just spicy it is some sugar my fish sauce I'm starting with just a teaspoon I'm going to cook that I'm going to reduce the curry paste down a little bit so you don't have too much liquid something like this is looking good because if you got too much liquid you add the rice and the rice is gonna get too wet too mushy so I'm gonna now add my chicken let the chicken cook briefly my cameraman is having a cuffing situation the chili is pretty strong I'm gonna go in with my vegetables all my vegetables Micra see your lime leaves and cook that up just until the chickens about 70% done so it's all about timing in this dish it's all about timing yeah so a lot of people think when you're stir frying in a wok the heat needs to be extremely high that's not always the case in some cases like patsy you and things like that yes you want the heat to be as high as you can go but for some things like this when you're involving curry paste and coconut milk and things that can burn you do not necessarily want to cook it on high heat okay so my chicken is mostly done got a little bit to go but it's perfect timing to add our rice because then when the rice is done the chicken will be perfectly done smells so good so at this point if you have if you're proving this for the first time you want to give it a taste and then adjust your saltiness with more fish sauce and you can add a little bit sugar I've done this before so I know that I need a teaspoon and that should do it but if it's your first time you definitely want to give it a taste at this point okay and that's it we're done and now all we have to do oh I forgot my sight hazel I knew it was it felt a little strange Thai basil you want to turn off your heat first then you toss in the Thai basil because you don't want to cook the Thai basil for too long in too intense of the heat or they'll turn black and not very nice looking mmm oh that smells good okay let's go plate it up so this SERPs about to perfect amount for a couple there you go look how nice it looks so when you choose vegetables you want to make sure you've got you know all the good colors in there you want have some red some green wipe the edges of my plate a little okay it's eating time ooh I can smell the spice this is gonna be spicy mmm oh yeah that's good if you need a kick in the butt if you've been eating bland food and you're just sick of bland food this is it this is it right here it's gonna like brighten up your world it's spicy it's got lots of herbs you can really taste the kaffir lime leaves on the end the base of coming through and it's so easy I mean that was one of the easiest things I've ever made on how to hide kitchen so please do give it a try it doesn't have to
