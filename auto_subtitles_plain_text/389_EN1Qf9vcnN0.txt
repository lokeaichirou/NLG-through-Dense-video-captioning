 in this video I'm going to share how I make flatbread or also known as not the ingredients that you need are three cups of flour 1 teaspoon of salt or to taste 3 tablespoons of unsalted melted butter 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1 tablespoon of yeast 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar 1/4 of a cup of warm water about one cup of warm water and some oil the first step is to add the sugar to the yeast and add the 1/4 cup of warm water mix it well and let the yeast rise for about 10 minutes after 10 minutes this is what your yeast should look like it should be very foamy and have risen a lot next add the baking powder to the flour as well as the salt the yeast and the butter as well as about half a cup of water warm water that is and then just give that a quick mix and add the remaining half a cup of warm water you may need more or less depending on the kind of flour that you're using but for me one cup was exactly the right amount and then I'm just mixing that with the spoon but at some point you'll have to use your hands and knead the dough for about three to five minutes the consistency of the dough should be sticky that is what is going to make them really nice and airy you don't want your dough to be too tough so if the dough is sticky and moist and that's a good thing if it's not sticky enough then you should add a little bit of water and next just add a little bit of oil on top and just spread that all over you're gonna have to let this rise for a few hours and the oil is going to prevent it from forming a crust and as you can see the dough is really nice and soft so then just cover that with anything that you have I just use some foil and then it rise for about two to four hours the longer you let it rise the better the dough will be next preheat a pan and make sure that the temperature is on low to medium heat and then this is what the dough looks like after it has risen mine rows for about two and a half hours but like I said the longer the butter can let it rise up to four hours and will be good and then just take some oil and rub it on your hands so that it's not sticky and then take the desired amount of dome depending on how large you want your flatbread to be and I'm actually not gonna be needing that dough again I'm just gonna be leaving it as is and just taking a little bit of dough as I go along so then just take a plate or any flat surface and then then just spread out the dough the flatbread form make sure that you do not make it too thin otherwise you'll have a crunchy flatbread and then just really quickly throw it on the pan and if it stretches out too much you can gather it together and let that cook for about two minutes on the first side until you start seeing the top cooking from within and when the bottom also gets nice dark brown spots and then on the second side cook it for about one more minutes and I know this is not the most perfectly shaped flatbread but it's homemade so it's okay and this is what it should look like and then just repeat the same process just put some oil on the surface you're working on put the dough on top you can put a little bit more oil if you want to and then just flatten it out into a circle again making sure it's not too thin because if it's thicker it'll be nicer and softer and then again really quickly just throw it on the pan gather it back together if it stretches out too much and as you can see over here there's the dough and there's where it has dried up and cooked from within a little bit so while the bottom is cooking the top will start drying up and that's when you can tell that you're ready to flip it as well as when the bottom is getting nice dark brown spots so it took about two minutes for the first side and one minute for the second side and that one is ready as well so these are the finished flat breads I got about eight of them from this recipe and as you can see they're really soft and very delicious and very chewy for extra softness which is how we like it in my family I cover it with some foil and let it stay for about 10 minutes and the steam and the heat of the flatbread will actually make the rest of the bread really nice and soft and that is it this bread came out really delicious and I made the whole house smell like delicious homemade bread it was so good I hope that you all give it a try and if you do please give me some
