 hey guys salut yeah my legs and today I'm showing you a very iconic dish from Tom's the coq Monsieur I will show you the ultra classic stuff first and afterwards maybe a little twist on it please show some supplies at least the conversation which is crispy outside and melt inside and know what it can be done in under ten minutes which is quite phenomenal for a French dish you want to do it now you don't want to do it I do let's do it first off grab two thick slices of sandwich bread lay them flat in front of you and better them on one side only for the first slice place the butter side down add a slice of cheese I'm using Conte here to keep it really French but feel free to go for cheddar mozzarella you name it then goes a slice of ham I will use higher welfare pork I will use higher welfare pop what this is the autosuggestion method I think it will work I believe so afterwards another slice of cheese you see the cheese is the glue of this sandwich finish him with the other slice of bread this time better side up to stay classic we will grill this sandwich in a pan and not in a toaster like I did in the past with some fat success but don't get me wrong I still believe that the toaster method is the less chaotic one unless your kitchen starts to burn unless your kitchen starts to burn right and it starts to spread unless your kitchen starts to burn right and it starts to spread unless your kitchen starts to burn right and it starts to spread frying pan on medium heat sandwich goes in and simply cover it loosely with aluminium foil no lead is needed because it would create too much steam thus making the sandwich goes so deep fry it for about 2 minutes each side but check occasionally at the end it should be golden and crispy don't brush it meaning do not set the heat too high otherwise it will burn so personally I do like the croque monsieur as it is nothing more but sometimes people find it too dry so let's make a white and cream sauce to go with it in french we call it bechamel sauce but don't be scared really because i do have the perfect cheek color to microwave-safe cups 1 tablespoon butter in the first one and a good dash of milk in the second one pop them in the microwave for 1 minute and a half afterwards one tablespoon flour goes in the butter mix well and add the hot milk then pop this mix 20 to 30 seconds in the microwave to thicken up at the end it's 80% similar to a fancy French bechamel sauce but for only 20% of the original time okay so how to play this out well in Paris it's often done like so just spread with bechamel sauce and broiled until golden what I'm afraid this is idiot well not optimal there are many issues with it I mean we made a crispy and golden sandwich and now all you end up with is a soggy and burnt edge sandwich so instead I will share with you the only way to get the best on both world you know crispiness long and moister well cut the immerse you in two fingers and put some bechamel sauce in an egg cup yes boiled egg and soldiers this is the inspiration right before eating it did the soldier in the sauce and my word on it moisture and crispiness guaranteed each time so guys that's it I told you a measure is nothing complex and you know it might even looks a bit simplistic in a way but keep in mind that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication I really hope you enjoyed this recipe so like comment share and subscribe people bye-bye
