 hello namaste Salaam walekum sorry Gotham welcome back to another session with your wash up at wah revoir calm what comes to your mind when I say soup first thing you think of is a cold a warm comforting steaming hot tomato see how easy it is to land on tomato soup that is because I together with 1 billion other Indians will testify to the fact that tomato soup falls under the category of comfort fruits it is definitely Indian Indian national soup is supposed to be mulligatawny soup that is ordinary if you travel the famous Indian drivers and want soup you get tomato if you walk into any hotel and see soup section on the menu you may not actually find more than a but I am willing to bet 100 bucks that you will see tomato so to make this tomato soup just heat some butter in a pan add little bit cumin seeds because I love to run little cumin just add a little bit cumin seeds hack then chop garlic okay add some chopped onion very little for 3 Tomatoes have used a small on him you can add any vegetables you want to this so I love to use celery in my soup because celery gives a very nice flavor you can add leeks you can add carrots you can add any vegetables you want and one more vegetable I love in tomato soup is bell pepper there is a green pepper or we call it capsicum in India so use little bit so what this does is it gives a very nice of flavor to your tomato soup after you saute this for a woman and chopped tomatoes add little salt the one hope that goes excellent with your tomato soup is basil if you have this will just add you know I don't have a basil so for you know what actually I think I have okay okay I have this bagel so I just bought it recently so it is hanging out there so we're going to use some of this basil ah if you have this immediately a very nice flavor comes I do not know how but somehow I will find my ingredients from somewhere or nada so I add some pepper so after you have a cook this tomato curry what you do is transfer it into a blender for a soup you need some kind of thickening so what we are going to do we are going to make some roof we're going to make some blonde Roux blonde Roux is slightly golden in color so what I am going to do a Matt I'm going to add some mida around the 1 teaspoon maybe little less than 1 teaspoon of my de what I did I added 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour to my butter and on a slow flame I am going to cook along with the butter okay the roux is slightly Brown see I have taken this tomato puree what I made I strained it and I'm going to add little by little first add very little and then add slowly see if you add everything at one time this is going to form lumps once it gets slightly dissolved then add the entire amount yeah let us simmer this for like 10 minutes then we will check salt and seed me oh yeah you know while while blending I had a very little red color because to get this nice tomato kind of consistency and I now to add a little bit of sugar in my tomato soup that gives a very nice taste to the soup adding cream is optional but I love to add so I'm going to add a little bit of cream to my tomato soup look at this the whole studio is smelling nice tomato soup with nice basil from my hub section by the way many toppings can also be used such as sour cream shredded cheese crackers or salsa but with kids around the world believe me I don't know what the fascination is with little kids maybe all the kids like to see the brown floating things and if you ever wonder what those brown floating things on the top of tomato soup don't fear you can even make that at home if you stick with my show maybe you will even learn how to manufacture a husband at home that learns to cook so coming back to those little brown things they're called croutons they are nothing but neat squares of bread that are deep fried and they turn crispy golden brown when they float and slowly soak on the tomato soup they make you a hero in front of your kids when I started to show I didn't realize that I didn't have protons but I had bread so what I did I simply fried my breads and now I have them on my tomato soup those little brown things floating I hope you have enjoyed today's session of learning to make this great soup remember that whatever is all about inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes cooking tips so others may benefit from your great cooking thank you
