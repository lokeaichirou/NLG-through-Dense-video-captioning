 hi I'm Nia and I welcome you all to the Laguna's kitchen today I am going to be making some mussels crispy hot samosas the famous Mumbai roadside snacks people have it as it is or usually it is salt sandwich between Lodi pounds for this recipe we need plain flour salt ghee carom seeds boiled potatoes boil green peas whole coriander seeds cumin seeds asafoetida garam masala dry mango powder ginger green chilli paste coriander and oil so now we begin making the recipe this recipe is divided into two parts the dough and the stuffing so first we will make the dough for this we need plain flour a little melted ghee carom seeds and of course salt mix this well and we need into a stiff dough remember this it has to be a very stiff dough using a little water samosas are usually enjoyed hot and crispy now if you really want very crispy samosas you can add a TSP of corn flour to the dough this will really make the outer covering crisp so our dough is ready and as you all know all the doors require a little resting period we are going to cover it and keep aside for 15 minutes at least until then we'll make the stuffing so for the stuffing we need oil let it heat a bit then we will start tempering a little cumin seeds and as they crackle a little asafoetida and then the spice ginger green chilli paste saute it for a while and then add potatoes boil Greenpeace mix it well smash them a little lightly using your spoon and allow them to cook for two to three minutes ensure that when you boil and chop the potatoes they are not cut into very big cubes and when you mash them like this while cooking they get uniformly mixed so now we lack the masalas garam masala dry mango powder a little hole coriander seeds you can crush them as well and of course salt again mix them let the masalas also cook for two minutes and then we learn the common Indian her coriander mix this again so here's our stuffing ready a little variation to this made in some households is also using milk paste what you can do is get a little mint leaves and combine them with green chilies a little lemon juice a little salt and blend it in a mixer and add that paste to this stuffing and here I have used garam masala in that you can replace garam masala with pav bhaji masala this is just a variation if you wish you can also make the stuffing using mint paste so our stuffing is ready our dough has been rested well now we'll make the samosas and before you begin rolling ensure that you keep the oil for deep-frying to heat and then take the dough and knead it once divide this into two equal portions and we roll out one portion into an oval shape now I am going to roll it into an oval shape but if you are not comfortable you can also roll it into a round also remember one more thing when making this outer covering for the samosas a common mistake most people make is they roll this very thinly now this will break when you deep-fry them so please ensure that you do not roll it very thinly now we will cut it into two pick one portion hold it like this on your pan and now we start rolling it from one end to the other end to form a cone this is how we form a coal press the edge a bit so that the stuffing is well sealed inside now here's your corn ready take a little stuffing and stuff it well press it a bit and using a little water seal these edges press a little from this edge as well and here's our samosa ready let's do one more first we make it into a cone take the stuffing press it a bit I seal it yeah as samosas are ready to be deep-fried and our oil is also ready for deep fry so let's deep fry them ensure you cook them on a very medium flame or else the covering from outside will ground but from inside it will yet be uncooked also remember to use enough oil for deep-frying cook them to layer golden brown from both the sides and if you have a party at home you can keep these samosas half cooked and then deep-fry when your guests come rather than keeping them just uncooked so our samosas are getting ready now hmm crispy hot samosas are ready drain them on a tissue paper and now they are ready to be served try them and let us know about this recipe up coke very simple recipe Cassie lucky acaba chili to like it or up go by reduce lead a sepia chili stop in a clicky t-ara ha after suggestions or comments the robots are changing
