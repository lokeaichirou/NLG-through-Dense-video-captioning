 I am stinky say hi I'm Kathy DJ today we are going to make a base you can fry rice Oh Kappa Kapow so let's dive right in with your basil chicken fried rice the first thing we need for fry rice is four cups of cooked rice okay and that is jasmine rice right and now why do you use jasmine rice Tice preferred jasmine rice and jasmine rice is actually long grain fragrant rice and that's the Thai favorite alright and next is six clove of garlic okay and two Thai chili peppers so depending on how spicy you want and of course if you don't want it spicy leave it out I've smashed all these together in the mortar here okay when you do this you have to be careful and then why are you smashing it okay to chop everything up yes you can do that but this will bring out more flavor all the garlic and let she leave your purse you can actually just use a big knife and lay it flat and smash everything under it if you don't have a mortar pestle but if you're going to cook Thai food a lot definitely invest in one of these because it makes everything taste way better so how fine are you smashing this it doesn't have to be real fine just to release all those flavors and break it up so you don't get a huge bite of Chilean or a huge bite of garlic okay this is about Jess right looks good okay and I would heat up the oil now medium heat for now just to heat up the oil okay you've got a big walk there and how much oil are you gonna use a quarter cup okay of vegetable oil all right and we're using medium heat at first so that we don't overcook the chicken right no we don't want to burn the garlic okay before that she can in that way and we use high heat okay okay good to know and garlic when it burns it gets a yucky bitter bitter flavor right okay I start to see the smoke so this is good time to put the talaq and she kept her in okay how are you gonna cook that oh just few seconds just to to Browder dalek but not to burned it alright and this is a chicken meat is one and a half pounds okay and what are you using crusty yeah you can use whatever you like and what needs or the done okay and now are you going to cook the chicken all the way through the club maybe have the coop okay and this is oyster sauce this is a pretty tablespoon okay oranges are and I put in 1 tsp off a suger and that oil sauce is a Chinese ingredient aha and pool tablespoon of fish sauce okay and fish sauce is a staple of Thai food it's made out of anchovies or other small sets and then they put the small fish into these large jars and the mixes it with saltwater and then they leave the jars in the Sun for several minutes the fish actually dissolves in the water and then it gets all night and very very salty at this point they asked more liquid to sit it out right and that's what fish sauce is was a staple of Thai foods it's got a nice meaty flavor that salt doesn't tend to have so 25 years ago when my mom first came to America from Thailand she packed up all her bags ready to go and she spilled her suitcases with fish sauce and then she got off the plane and my dad had seen her suitcases full of fish sauce and he just started laughing don't have at me so that was the frantic goodbye ending here sorry people could not live without fish sauce okay and that's it and gone - he's tired okay now we're really cooking and put in the right okay and again how much rice is that full cup cooked right this is a great meal especially if you've got some leftover rice sitting around because nothing makes a better fried rice than day-old rice it's a little drier so the rice holds its own very well yo and you so fry on my screen and I feel burns so we cook this until does she think it's cool okay and typically how long does it take five minutes three to five minutes okay depending on how hot your stove is we've got a really hot pan so quicker than most okay when the chicken is cool uh-huh I put in this is from one red bell pepper okay a whole red bell pepper huh thank you Red River and right it's fine Fred shape okay and I will put in about two cups of fresh basil okay Betty Lee's okay I'll go ahead and say okay Oh smells so great the basil is a key ingredient in this recipe okay and that's an obligate some you don't want to cook that put it in there the bowl here you got a nice Bowl and I honestly think if I had to pick one thing that I had to live off him for the rest of my life it would be this chicken basil fried rice I love it you okay looks good and this is how we serve the spicy chicken fry rice with sweet basil uh-huh Thai people always eat fried rice with fresh cucumber it cuts down the spiciness gives it a nice crunch and the cool flavors with the spicy flavor so it tastes so good and of course Elantra right no just to put it on top okay as a garnish it's not just something that I've grown to love and we always put fresh limes on the side okay so you can squeeze it on top of the fries if you like oh I love all kinds of flavors all mixed in one dish looks great I can't wait to eat it want to learn how to cook the Thai dishes that you've seen on today's show female us at dim at Thai food tonight calm and tell us the recipe that you'd like will also be happy to try and answer any of your Thai cooking questions this program brought to you in part by Thai Kitchen offering a full line of high ingredients and products to help you bring that Thai experience home anytime you
