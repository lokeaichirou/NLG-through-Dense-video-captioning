 hello and welcome to the vegan corner here you have our recipe for a renowned Japanese preparation miso soup this dish as we mentioned in our recipe for dashi stock is all but vegan as one of its ingredients is fish we know how people love this soup so we decided to turn it into a fat free vegan delicacy we also wanted to point out that making miso soup better than any standard Japanese restaurant is that easy as they usually prepare it by mixing a small bag of instant dashi stock with water which is quite far from being healthy the ingredient list for this savory soup is in the description down below to begin with let's rehydrate the seaweed and place it into a small bowl and cover it with cold water within 10 minutes the few small pieces of dehydrated wakame will transform into big leaves drain the seaweed and remove the edible part from the central veins which are quite hard and not very pleasant to eat chop the seaweed into smaller pieces I'll take a spring onion and slice it into small round pieces next ingredient to add is the tofu you can use as much as you want of it as it is mainly needed for presentations purposes however we like to add the very little soul food to our soup and to cut it into tiny small dices what can I say we are perfectionists now to the main ingredient of the dish the actual soup heat the dashi stock until it starts steaming and you see small bubbles forming on the bottom of the pan now turn off the heat and stir in the miso how much me so you might ask well add it a little at a time until the soup has the level of savoriness that matches with your personal taste now miso is very difficult to dissolve in water and it also often contains some bigger pieces which are not desirable into the final soup to solve this problem we are using a miso strainer for this task called needs Akashi in Japan if you do not have this piece of equipment you can simply use a small fine mesh sieve or a tea strainer but if you do not have a Japanese missus strainer then what are you playing at everyone has a miso coffee at home right the variety of different miso available seems infinite however the most popular ones are red miso and white miso red miso being the words most utilized to prepare miso soup now let's put the pieces together to create the final soup for the sake of demonstration we are making a single portion here by using a small ceramic Japanese bowl as it is cute and appropriate however if you have a larger appetite don't be shy and use a salad bowl instead the first thing to go in are the onions followed by the seaweed now add the tofu and simply pour in the soup to complete the dish here is the final miso soup full of flavor and packed with umami in case you have a savory tooth this dish will surely satisfy it as it is considered one of the most delicious food ever invented the phenomenal taste makes it the perfect starter for any meal thanks for watching this video and if your mouth is watering simply hit the like button and we can guarantee it will stop immediately not lying to the next recipe
