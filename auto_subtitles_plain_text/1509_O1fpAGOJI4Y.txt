 we're gonna do fish and chips these home shippers yeah you know they're chippers all over Ireland almost one next door to almost every pulpit so it's a very simple dish and it looks oh I've seen I've seen the finished product it is so delicious look at how much water we put a one on one third one and three-quarter cups of water okay and then we're just a little sifted flour like to cut about two cups of flour and we just gradually add that into the water this is just a simple flour batter yeah it's very simple flour batter in England they would use beer in the batter but in Ireland we prefer to your quarters we drink our beer have you ever tried it with beer no I've tried this and it makes it a little fluffier than I like when you find a more slightly more Brady bathroom art then we use a little veggies okay quarter teaspoon and okay that'll make a difference that's gonna rise the batter just a little bit and it'll also help to brown it nicely and a half a teaspoon of salt okay okay so we'll just mix that until we have a nice smooth let's break down slides sorry okay so we'll take her batter and I like just pass it through a large hole strainer in mind just to make sure there are no big lumps in it and can use our rubber spatula to get all that out of there and no lumps so you don't have any no big ones anyway and you don't have any pieces of flour in here on your beautiful fish okay and then we just let that pass through there very easily and what kind of oil do you fry in we I like to use canola oil no trans fats of course and you know it's really important with the oil to make sure that it's clean when oil gets old and and greasy it'll adhere to your fish and make it very heavy and greasy dish now what kind of fish is that we're using Cod today there are lots of different fishes that work really well bust and blue cod is good which is also known as pollock or haddock ray is used in Dublin and that's a you know peasant blue collar dish that they would serve in the Dolan chippers so we dredge our fish in a little bit of flour I'd like to do one for me tonight right now and then just dip it into the batter okay and then in a very similar does the flour just have make the batter stick a little bit exactly okay exactly if we don't do flour the batter will tend to slide off and I mean I don't get that whole cohesive dish okay so this looks good it really just cut it nice yeah and you see how it's kind of the same thickness as pancake batter that's what we look for and the oil should be what temperature 360 degrees okay okay so we just swim the fish back and forth in the same method that you would if you were making tempura you can use the tongs it down swim your fingers in there yeah believe me I've done it more than once and it takes about seven minutes okay oh it looks so good and we wash our hands oh yeah just rinse that that awesome Mike beautiful so don't overcrowd the pan you know if this popular size about four pieces is perfect okay you don't have to move anything right now we'll just let it cook there for a few minutes because we swam it back and forth it won't stick too long okay okay so then the next part of the dish of course is the chips and and do you make traditional french fries shape yeah exactly the same the nice long french fry shape and you use Idaho potatoes are perfect they've the right amount of starch so I'll just cut them into slices first very carefully and you can lay it down on the side like that makes it easier right and then we have I'm gonna take each slice and I like my chips big like that okay you know nice you soak them in water or I like to wash them in water because the it'll wash off some of the surface starch on it they won't get too dark and turn brown okay so then we fry them at 285 degrees we fried these already yes it first fry right so they get 10 minutes at 285 degrees and then that's a blanched right make sure the potatoes are cooked all the way through okay and then the second fry will do at 350 degrees just until they're nice and golden brown so you put in at a time about so you don't use a fry basket or no it's not necessary to use a broad basket you can use a tabletop deep fryer they work really well and then you know again we don't don't want to overcrowd so the oil doesn't come up too high right just a bad like that a nice gentle simmer bubbling away yeah and then look what comes out gorgeous gorgeous and then you get the beautiful chips and that fish looks so beautiful just a little coarse salt to your favorite salts Morton's table salt works really well kosher salt is delicious and what's this and then of course the classic vinegar salt vinegar is the wavy surfaces
