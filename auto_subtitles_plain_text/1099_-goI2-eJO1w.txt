 hey dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah cooking I have a special July 4th recipe to share with you so July 4th aka Independence Day aka one of Will Smith's best movies ever am i right today we're gonna make chili dogs gonna have a little song and it goes something like this just shut your chili dogs chit chit chit chili dogs and I'm gonna figure out the rest of it later to make our chili we're gonna start out by opening a beer it's very important that you drink beer while you're making chili because that is the American Way and oh that's good I'm gonna put a little oil in here or a lot whatever and I'm gonna saute this onion just try to get it a little bit soft we don't really need to brown it or anything like that and make sure that you chopped it up real real small the thing about chili dog chili is that it's almost like a meat paste and I know that sounds delicious and you're probably just like slathering at the mouth right now thinking about meat paste but I promise that it'll be great once it's done so yeah just make sure that you minced your onions and everything really really small okay so after just about a minute your onions will start to look a little bit translucent not totally but okay now I'm gonna add jalapeno and garlic if you wanted to keep this mild if you were making this for like a bunch of children or something or very elderly people then you could just use some green bell pepper for the jalapeno okay so now for the funnest part we're gonna put our meat in I'm gonna put it on top of the onion and now the second beer that you're gonna need is gonna go in so the thing about the way that they get the meat to be so like falling apart tiny little chunks is you don't Brown at first you're actually basically boiling it so adding a beer if you wanted to use beef broth or something instead that would be fine but we're gonna cook this so long the alcohol dog and I cook off anyway so once I've got some in there I'll start breaking it up a little bit and then I'm gonna add some seasoning so I've got here is just a cumin chili powder a little bit of allspice which is a little secret ingredient I meant some paprika because I want to make this extra red because you know of the flag and stuff there's red on it and some Worcestershire sauce few healthy blogs of that and a little bit of dry mustard I could also just use like some yellow prepared mustard if you don't have dry mustard I'm gonna add some tomato paste I really just like this because it's fun squirt it out and I get to just like deck it all up okay cool so a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and basically I'm just gonna bring this up to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour okay one hour later this is what we're looking at I just stirred this about every 15 minutes or so and now at the very end give it a taste add some salt if you think it needs it but remember the hot dogs usually pretty salty too so maybe you could under Celt it I'm just gonna add a little touch just a smidge of some apple cider vinegar and I happen to love vinegar and sour things not that that really makes this like sour but I just think it makes it taste more like chili dog chili but it's optional if you you know just give it a taste if it seems a little bit like it needs a little perk then try a little bit of vinegar that's a good tip generally in life okay move this aside and tada I'm gonna show you my favorite way to cook hot dogs inside so I've got my skillet here with a little bit of water in it so I'm gonna throw a couple weenies in here basically I'm sort of combining the steam or boil hot dog method with a little bit of a fry so I'm gonna bring this up to a simmer and just kind of let these cook until the water evaporates by then and they'll be nice and warm if some of the fat will have rendered out and then we'll let them sort of fry and crisp up and whatever fat is left in the pan so just watch and see it's gonna be magical okay so our waters almost evaporated off here a few minutes later and just gonna leave them in the dry pan now first just a couple seconds when you decide to get the casing nice and crispy got them up in here you could heat these up in the oven wrapped up in foil can I get them steamed so I like a little bit of cheese I like to put the cheese down in between the chili and the hot dog to make sure it gets melted dude cha-cha-cha chili dog see this chili is great cuz it's nice and thick so it's not like running out of the bun it's just sort of staying where you put it and it's not gonna make your bun like super wet and soggy little onion because I like a spicy I'm gonna do a little jalapeno a little pickled jalapeno they're super yummy and then a little blue just like in the cartoons okay let's give it a taste of Rooney that's just like a perfect little submarine of goodness good lord what did that tell me you don't want to eat that right now well there you go there's how to make chili dogs
