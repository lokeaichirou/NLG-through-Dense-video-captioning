 all right it's been cooked 30 minutes so you can skim out all the impurity several times I did and I can strain it because I need the broth that's why I don't strain it right onto the sink and it new putt for that so without heat pick it up we have a source right let me add just a thumb seed oil so mix it all well you cannot marinate for 30 minutes like that that's why I said we need lots of care and time to make it pay if you have a more time you can keep reducing so you can get more deep flavor of broth right so let me just put it like that so get even flavor you can't like F like every five minutes you can just move the shore leaves like that so you marinate first then I'm gonna add I'm gonna cook it after 30 minutes then add once it boiled I'm gonna take 1 cup of broth and put it here because it's going to be too salty and after that I'm gonna add lots of ingredient in there but not from beginning otherwise it's going to be four parts marry this five twenty five minutes and actually like two months ago was my father's birthday so we asked it a one who want to eat because we getting orders we have to treat him and he definitely asked us to make this Shirley Kyle victim and actually I'm cooking every day so he thought I'm gonna be carried tired so he was my second sister to make this and she never done it before even though she's Korean is she's like 30 over 35 I'm not gonna say exact and she was almost cry I never done it before what I'm gonna do so I gave her my recipe and it turns out really well and you are watching this all the process so even though you're for dinner I think you can make it without any mistake all right while we are waiting for that I told you I'm going to show you how to peel the ginkgo nuts so you put a little bit of oil sing it as easily and if you put that here like a honey or like corn syrup then it's easy to peel out but today we have a too much ingredient so I'm not gonna add it later I show you because the Korean people use ginkgo not a lot so I'm going to show you next time so you get just keep top aides so when it's popping out then you will see that the skin is have killed naturally then I'm going to transport that to here kitchen towel they Rock and that's it I'm going to start hit it up so when it's smoothly hit it off then add one cup of broth that I have sorry very fancy just prepare you can peel it like that easy all right so I need ten piece but I told you before you know to worry about it even though you don't have this you cannot again flip it then I have more time to do that see the key you squeeze out the water and always the stem off to that set then call it quarter be ready and if you don't have dry the seat a key you just press it a key but pre read the last minute right it's been boiling starts boiling is last cooking process when you have this you're gonna add one cup of broth and keep cooking it so what was the sauce and all the broth mixture is reduced by half then you add all the ingredients so stick around more than like five minutes turn it down a little bit so it's gonna be praised we can braise in the open but also under stopped me while you are waiting I add chestnuts and this is readies carrots and ginkgo nut and C Turkey and you know keep cooking it I'm gonna simmer it actually braising so after like 10 minutes I think it's gonna be really tender and cooked see it's already tender so this isn't not exact what I want is not desired texture it should be more like sticky little bit so you keep shouting like that and absolutely you cover it when you break and jujube a also free cover and I will show you when I played it and last minute you can add that culture again alright welcome back it's been braising like over 30 minutes for 30 to 40 minutes all the flavor I to princeless the closer like that too shiny very cool minutes then you can get the Korean the most luxury and expensive Korean food ever so it's time to plate finally I know you need lots of time but um get get a time together you know very delicious and healthy foods it has lots of protein and let's of best of it in there so you need rice and bread that's it or kimchi and it's really good combination of cucumber cold soup because something like hot or spicy food really go well with cucumber cold soup so you can click on next time let's keep breathing see if you don't like the bone you can take take that out like that you can take just beep that see it how tender it is there you go turn off so thank you for watching a long time I wish you can come here enjoy that yummy food with me but you can try it right okay thank you bye bye
