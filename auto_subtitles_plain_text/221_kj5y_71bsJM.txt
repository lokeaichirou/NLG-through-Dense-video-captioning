 hash brown potatoes hi I'm a new pilot welcome you to send Jeff Kapoor khazana I am going to be showing you how to make hash brown potatoes it is a very heat breakfast item and again a very simple recipe so let's quickly see what all we need to make hash brown potatoes for this we need potatoes which are parboiled I am using the non starchy pareto variety basically how do you know if a potato will start your non starchy in this case when you use non starchy potatoes the skin is a little thin like you see this you can easily peel it off with your fingers so this is how a non starchy potatoes looks like I have power boiled them 1 TSP black pepper powder salt to taste and oil to shallow fry first of all we need to peel these potatoes since we have power boil them peeling will not be very easy so use a knife so once we have peeled the potatoes we have to grade them use the thicker side of the grater so that we have nice big fat strands of potatoes and don't go over and over just one and out like this this is how you need to grade the potato ok the potatoes are grated now we'll add in salt to this some pepper powder and the use of folk to just mix this well just like this or you could alternately use two folks so that all the salt and the pepper that we've added gets mixed very well and in this process we are not really breaking the potato strands keeping it intact so once we have mixed in all the salt and pepper we have to lightly press this so firstly that we need to do is apply a little oil and also heat up a nonstick pan just need to press this a bit so that when you cut this it forms a cake some oil in this another way of cooking hash brown potatoes is instead of using oil use clarified butter if you have a lot of clarified butter you use that because it gives a very nutty flavor to the hashbrowns once you fry them now we need a cutter like this and with this just cut out roundels use a flat spoon to lift up these and you place it on this non-stick pan as I have mentioned to you meaning to use non starchy perrito's since the starch and this is quite low the potatoes don't brown very fast and when they don't Brown they get crispier and crispier and in case of hash brown you need absolutely crisp which is why we using these kind of potatoes so we have to cook them till the bottom goes crisp and then we will flip and cook the other side as well once the base is golden we'll flip and we will cook this along with omelets very often you will find hash drawn being served hash brown is actually a potato dish which accompanies most of the English breakfasts so if you want to serve it for breakfast otherwise you could also serve it as a snack to York in the Piero's are done let's remove them on a plate the hash brown is ready make it just the way I have made it and you'll love it
