 good evening my fellow reptiles and welcome to this new series on my channel where I'm gonna be doing cooking tutorials I'm gonna try to do this at least once a week I'm gonna start off very very basic I for one love food I hopefully you love food too and I'm living on my own right now and I need to I want to basically showcase you guys some basic things that you can make very very simple and easy for yourself in case you're hungry because who doesn't like to be able to make food for themselves and as time goes on these cooking tutorials are going to get more advanced they're gonna get more complex and I'm gonna be making some of my own personal favorite dishes something that's really odd with me when I cook though is that I hate cooking for myself when I eat my own food that I make for myself it's very very basic but when I have guests over or I want to cook for somebody else I loved cooking for other people it's weird I won't cook for myself I'm lazy [ __ ] but when it comes to other people I get all excited sexually excited and I have a strange fetish of loving to watch people eat my own food that I made yes it sexually turns me on but today we're gonna be taking a look at a grilled cheese sandwich basic right well this is not just a normal grilled cheese sandwich this is actually known as an inside and out grilled cheese sandwich which you know how you have a normal grilled cheese cheese in the middle well it's a little bit different and today I'm gonna teach you how to make one and it tastes ten times better than a normal grilled cheese and I promise you this is not going to turn into a drunk kitchen however before we begin I think H nice swig of fireball whiskey would do me some good now let's get cooking don't-ee nonstick frying pan put some real butter and melt it if you're using margarine we can't be friends but please use real butter butter that's what makes this actually work because this butter that we're melting here to medium to low heat is actually going to allow the cheese to stick into the bread which will allow it to caramelize so place two pieces of bread into the butter again this is on medium to low heat you don't want to make put this too high or else it will burn and don't want that I'm using sharp cheddar cheese for this video you can use any cheese you want it really doesn't matter but make sure you shredded you don't have to use shredded but that's what's preferable and that's what works the best fold that over top and then we're gonna do the exact same thing after you finish placing the rest of the cheese on the top we're gonna put throw another little piece of butter in there again real butter not margarine I want to stress that it's really really important you're gonna melt that and then we're gonna flip this right on top of the butter and that's actually going to allow the cheese to caramelize into the bread we're gonna do the same thing we just did put some more cheese on the top of the other side just like we previously did it's a very repetitive process and we're gonna let that sit to 4 to 5 minutes and then flip again now as you can see here we're gonna flip again after this is a constant constant of 3 to 4 minutes on either side and as you can see here it's kind of golden brown and you can actually see that the cheese is caramelized into the bread it's actually soaked in and you can see that little crunchy sound that crunch with my fork that is what that's when you know that it is perfect it's really that simple well you flip it to 4 to 5 minutes let it sit on this side let's cut this open and see what it looks like mmm look at that middle and the top and bottom caramelized cheese I love cheese so there you have it ladies and gentlemen my fellow reptiles I already took a bite out of this and I can say that it is wonderful if you like grilled cheese sandwiches this is going to out beat a normal grilled cheese by tenfold thank you guys for watching my a McDaniel fold bock
