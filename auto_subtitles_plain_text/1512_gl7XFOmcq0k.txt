 hi everyone today we're going to show you how to make one variation of chicken curry you'll need the following for this recipe 1 whole chicken washed up and cut into small pieces 1 large onion 5 to 6 garlic cloves 1 and a half inches of ginger 1/2 a TSP of turmeric powder 1/2 a tbsp of red chili powder 2 tablespoons of coriander powder 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper 1/2 a teaspoon of salt water which isn't shown here 1 cup of corn oil and 1/2 a bunch of cilantro which is also optional so start off by slicing the onion then we'll head over to the stove add the sliced up onion to the frying pan and add the corn oil as well we're just going to fry the onions for about five to eight minutes until they get soft then go ahead and drain out the oil from the onions take the onions garlic cloves and 1/4 cup of water and add that to the blender and liquify then go ahead and add your chicken to the frying pan let it cook for about two to five minutes until the chicken starts turning white then add the blended onions and garlic clove mix after that add your spices including the turmeric powder the red chili powder coriander powder black pepper and the salt then go ahead and let it cook for about 10 minutes on low heat to avoid burning the spices make sure you stir occasionally then what we're going to do is we're going to raise up the heat a few notches in order to evaporate any excess water from the chicken this will make sure you get rid of any unpleasant chicken smell we're going to cook it for about another 35 to 40 minutes while making sure to stir every once in a while at the end of the step the meat should start separating from the bone once the water from the chicken evaporates you'll see that the fats and oils will start coming up to the top now in order to get more curry sauce we're going to add about 1 and 1/4 cups of water and let it cook for about 3 to 5 minutes until the water comes to a boil then add cilantro on top if you'd like and serve it with the bread like chapati or plain burrata please hit the subscribe button if you enjoyed this recipe see you next time
