 hi I'm Mike Lee and I love traveling around the world and trying different cuisines from all over the world so today I'm going to tell you about this recipe which is a pasta for grown-ups yes it's the penne alla vodka and this is a recipe or this is a dish that I had in a quaint little Italian bistro on New York's Upper East Side so I'm going to tell you about this pasta dish which I'm sure you're going to love let's see what we're going to need for this really yummy pasta dish so I'm going to need about two tablespoons of olive oil one tablespoon of butter one teaspoon of red chili flakes 1 teaspoon of dry Italian seasoning about two tablespoons of ketchup one tablespoon of all-purpose flour some salt and pepper then one cup of marinara sauce the recipe for this you will get in my playlist about two tablespoons of mozzarella about two tablespoons of Parmesan cheese then 2 cups of penne pasta about one and a half cups of whole milk and of course splash of vodka so let's start by heating our saute pan here okay make sure that your heat is really low because once you start working the milk in the recipe it burns very quickly so I'm going to add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil here now the reason why I add the olive oil first and the butter next because if you add the butter force it's going to burn so it's going to give that surely burnt effect which you don't want so now when it heats up slightly I'm going to add in the butter so the butter really gives us really creamy creamy texture to the pasta so that is the reason why we add butter as well so just let it melt slightly now what I'm doing here is I'm actually mixing the vegetable sauce which is the white cheese sauce and I'm mixing the marinara sauce so it gives a really creamy and gangee effect to the pasta all in one shot so my butter and olive oil have melted now so I am just going to add the 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour in this and at this point just whisk it nicely so we are cooking the flour slightly for a minute or two just to remove the rawness and to give it that thick texture in the cheese sauce that we want so this is your classic vegetable or white sauce as Italy so now I've made this really nice paste of the flour and the butter and the olive oil so now I'm adding about a cup and a half of whole milk in this so just add it and while you're adding just stir and whisk so that no lumps are formed so just add all that and keep on whisking so that no lumps are formed so the whole idea is to thicken the sauce slightly so that when we add the pasta it gets coated in the ridges so I'm just going to let this work in the meantime I'm just going to season it with some salt and pepper so now you see that my sauce has started thickening a bit we are going to let this work so that it gives a nice body to the pasta so at this stage I'm just going to add my mozzarella cheese right into the sauce so it gives a really cheesy flavor to the sauce we had a quick stir and you will see that the sources started coming together started thickening beautifully so our sauce is thickened beautifully now I'm just going to add my marinara sauce here a cup of it make sure that your heat is low nice thick tangy and creamy sauce perfect I'm going to give it a quick stir again so as of talking to you this whole place is just smelling of fantastic sauce so give it a quick stir mix it well just going to add the remaining sauce the reason why I didn't add the whole sauce first just to see how it looks because we want this really nice pink color to the sauce give it a quick mix now I'm going to slightly seasoned it with maybe a teaspoon of Italian seasoning just to give it more depth of flavor a teaspoon of red chili flakes and some ketchup two tablespoons of it and give it a quick stir again so now is the fun and exciting part so now I'm going to add the much-awaited wodka so pretty much you can use as much as you want I love to give it a couple of splashes about two tablespoons or so and now what we're going to do is we are going to let the alcohol evaporate and let the sauce boil so that we get all the flavors of water in it but without any alcohol so it's absolutely perfect for everybody so I'm just going to bring it up to a boil and then we'll add our pasta to it so now my sauce is started boiling and the alcohol is all evaporated so I'm just going to simply plop in the pasta right inside the sauce so what have you done here is made it more interesting by mixing some whole wheat pasta and some regular pasta just make it more fun and colorful just get all the sauce in the ridges of the pasta and that's it pretty much penne alla vodka is ready to be served so just give it a quick mix so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to ladle some on this serving platter here and this is just perfect for those late-night date nights for all those bachelors who want to impress their girlfriends and to finish it off I'm going to sprinkle some parmigiano-reggiano cheese which has to be as pure as you can get so just sprinkle some on top over here just to give it that extra sharpness and extra kick so my penne alla vodka is absolutely ready to be devolved this is just perfect for all those bachelors who want to impress their girlfriends so I hope you enjoyed watching this and I hope you will make it soon do subscribe to India Food
