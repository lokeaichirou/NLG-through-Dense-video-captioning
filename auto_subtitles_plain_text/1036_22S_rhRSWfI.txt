 if you're close to turning 50 don't let the number scare you don't be afraid of 50 the 12-step process of turning 50 it's filled with inspirations that you can embrace it and empower yourself this is Lisa samia's first book it's always great to have you thank you very much thank you for having me talk a lot about empowerment in this book yes I do the reason is when we think about empowerment what that really means in the process of why I wrote this book it's empowerment is tapping into your confidence and the power that is actually already there sometimes I think as we go through life we don't actually realize some of the gifts and talents that we have but when I wrote it when I sat down to write this book I was coming at a crossroads where I was saying to myself I'd always wanted to write and I didn't have faith in myself so how did I make that decision to do it all of a sudden at 50 because i found the resource the empowerment the ability of what was already there to create this now you're on the other side of 50 yes looking good right yeah you're really good it's wonderful the whole process of writing this book of coming out and speaking to people about all the different steps in the book has just been wonderful it continues to empower me to find ways to help other pieces while I'm thinking you're to yourself what was I afraid of exactly exactly I what are you sharing with us today this is a Middle Eastern recipe salad that I grew up with it is actually not in this book it is on my website Lisa Samia calm and the reason this recipe is a little bit different than the traditional Middle Eastern salads is first of all the name is called fattoush fattoush fattoush means small crumbs and that's going to liken to the toasted pita that we have here that I have repaired and what you do for this is you just put this this is a pita bread that has been opened like this put on a cooking sheet little olive oil a little bit of sea salt and garlic powder and you toast it in the oven for like 10-15 minutes in 11th class b you want it a little bit hard and you just set it off to the side so then what you're going to do for the recipe is this is about a cup and a half of diced tomato k you put that right in and this is a dishy say that really is a popular dish any time of the year anytime of the Year holidays I have this on my table thanksgiving and you're going to have it again and Chris absolutely okay and this is cucumbers and what I've done with these cucumbers let me just show you here is I have halved it and then quartered it and I took out the seeds this particular cucumber had a lot of seeds that for this particular recipe we don't want to have seeds so we take them out I like to use the English cucumber because yes a few receipt exactly but I just happened to get this as well so we mix it or use you just wait right and then the next thing we're going to put in is this is a combination of fresh mint and parsley and this is a rough chop so you can just has mint and parsley to get together okay and then we're going to have a chick peas which is a giggle it's an excellent source of protein again a very healthy ingredient anyways eat healthy yes I do it okay people ask me you know how do I stay in shape and what do I do i am what i eat this is really what i do except and then we're going to put about a quarter cup of olive oil in here extra virgin extra virgin and about a half a cup of fresh lime and lemon juice and you go ahead sir mixing okay great seen that up and the next ingredient i want to talk about is a sumac and sumac is this particular form of sumac is found in the Middle East specifically in Lebanon it's grown wild and but you can find it everywhere now absolutely you can yes right and this particular spice in Syrian means red so I'm just going to put a little bit in my hand here so you can see the beautiful red burnishing color we're going to just add this set 2 tbsp about actually yes 2 tablespoons in about a minute left this one okay and then we're going to add 1 tablespoon right exactly and a little bit of feta cheese this is an option I know it's getting better and better and then right at the very end this is the fun part this is where the little crumbs comes in we're actually just going to break the bread and add it right in as part of the salad it is so delicious it was so easy it is so easy and it is so healthy I mean there's no salt the only salt that's in it is is on the bread itself and of course if you want this recipe it is on our website wtnh.com and click on Connecticut style
