 hey guys welcome back to the Sunday project with me Jaclyn tonight we're cooking up some bibimbap vegetarian bibimbap this recipe calls for a lot of prep nothing too crazy just a lot of chopping so get the troops together and have a fun night in making this yummy meal before we get cooking chop up some to cover carrot mushroom and radish in to simcha sh sticks make them all roughly the same size then chop up some tofu into cubes now let's marinate your tofu in some sesame oil ginger and lemon juice as usual all the ingredients will be in my website the sundae project M then marinate the cucumber and apple cider vinegar water honey chili flakes and salt now for the assembly after all that prep this is the easy part if you have some hotpot bowls for bibimbap use those if not a regular pot works just fine place your hot pot over the stove and fill it two-thirds of the way up with rice we're using leftover brown rice but you can easily use whatever you have on hand then bring some water to a boil and quickly boil the carrots this part is optional you could really just throw all these in raw and it would still taste delicious distribute the carrots into your hot pots now fry up some lettuce and again distribute and then do the same for your radishes now fry up your mushrooms and again distribute see I told you this part was easy throw in some chopped mangoes for sweetness and kimchi for spice and then comes the marinated tofu and cucumbers don't waste that yummy gingery juice either throw that right in and to top it all off fry up an egg and slap that on sprinkle some sesame seeds on top and if you like it really hot don't forget the gochujang if going veggie isn't your thing you can easily add some thin slices of lightly fried pork to this and it would still work really well but I promise you this dish is so flavorful and filling you really wouldn't miss the meat now after all your hard work chopping and throwing things into your hot pot it's time to dig in and enjoy
