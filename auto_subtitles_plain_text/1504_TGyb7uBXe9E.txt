 all right it's done okay well okay I'm gonna show you guys about I'm making really nice scrambled eggs so what I have here is about a tablespoon of butter or more and the pan I'm getting it really hot and so it's nice and bubbly and then I have PVA's put a little water in that oil salt and pepper and whip it up really really good and pour it in this is the style that we use in order to get the most fluffy possible eggs so you'll see that we turn it down here right away but it's already made a little solidness so we just pull it in as we do this gently you know I want to mess around with it too much and just as it's heating here then we just bring the solid parts to the center just gently do that and then that allows the raw egg to rush around and get on this hot skillet all right so you see there's come probably coming in the center there you can tip the panel if necessary now the key thing about this is you know to over cook the eggs that's the most important thing you see this is only three eighths or just filled this skillet really full so then you start folding it over a little bit make sure there are any eggs there come out so you're tilting that a little bit again yeah tilting the pan a little and sometimes it's good said if you see any like liquid still on there then you can just take and flip that over and then turn it off because you're ready to serve and the most important thing the most important thing is don't overcook so that's it stuff Wow just put on your own plate okay [Music] here slightly and we're done let's go ahead and put those veggies on top okay this is a typical Sunday morning breakfast for salmon on okay so here we have you want to talk about what's in here this is just sauteed onion shitake mushrooms some asparagus with a roasted red pepper pesto and a little bit of - lemon juice okay now we're gonna just sprinkle it with a little bit of grated seaside cheddar and these are these plums are what are these are like plums and I can't remember the name thank you for asking that all that one and then we're just gonna top with a little bit of parsley that looks beautiful and add a little extra chlorophyll and greens okay and voila we are ready for breakfast thank you Sam
