 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with lamb shank vindaloo that's right I get a lot of complaints how come you never do Indian food it's because I'm scared I don't have a lot of experience with it I love to eat it but I thought I would give this one of my favorites to try this very spicy lamb type curry dish so I hope I got it close you Indian cuisine experts will be the judge so here we go alright so step one here I'm going to put four lamb shanks in a plastic bag you need to get marinated overnight before we start the dish so I'm gonna place those in and then into a bowl I'm going to pour some cider vinegar some vegetable oil some salt and then something called tamarind I'm using a tamarind concentrate and we'll talk a little bit about that on the blog but it's a very tart sour kind of citrus like ingredient alright I started mixing that up and then I realized I never put the garm masala in which is a blend of Indian spices we've used that before we like it alright so I'm gonna mix that in and that's basically the marinade so we're going to pour that over the lamb shanks we're going to seal up that bag really well alright just to confuse you I put mine in a second bag as I thought I had a leak we're gonna squeeze out as much air as possible so the meat is immersed in the marinade and then we're going to put that in the fridge overnight not a bad idea to turn it over once in a while alright the next day I'm going to pull it out of the bag I'm going to place it on an oiled foil lined sheet pan don't throw away the marinade by the way that's going in the stew later so just reserve the marinade I'm going to salt those generously on both sides and we're going to brown those in a very hot oven 450 for 15 or 20 minutes until they're nice and brown we're going to pull those out and reserve them til needed next up in a blender we're going to add a lot of garlic a lot of ginger some cherry tomatoes a nice big onion and a little bit of water we're going to pulse that on and off until we have a nice smooth puree and it kind of looks like a delicious strawberry smoothie and yet it's so the opposite of that so just set that aside and it's back over to the stove where we're going to start the actual vindaloo so we're going to put a heavy Dutch oven on medium-high heat and I'm going to put in some clarified butter now this is supposed to be something called ghee which is basically a clarified butter but clarified butter we'll work alright so I want to put my butter in I'm gonna throw roughly chopped onion in there with a big pinch of salt and we're gonna Brown this and I'm not talking golden brown I'm talking almost golden black that's going to add sweetness and a depth of color to the sauce so just keep cooking them and right there you're thinking that's probably good it's not let them go further okay while those are browning I'm going to get my spice blend together which is cumin cinnamon black pepper cayenne and a lot of it dry mustard and paprika okay and all that will be on the blog of course alright we're going to go back over the stove check the onions and now we're talking that's what we want nicely browned very dark edges perfect and at that point we're going to back the heat down to medium and dump in the spices and we're going to kind of toast the spices in that hot butter and that really wakes up the flavor and it really really adds an extra dimension which I guess would be the fifth dimension but who's keeping tract and that only needs to cook for about two minutes but it really does make a difference all right after that we're going to go ahead and dump in the marinade that was left over from the bag of lamb alright remember that was the cider and the tamarind and the oil all right so I'm going to dump that in and then we're going to dump in the mixture from the blender the onion the tomato the ginger the garlic we're going to give that a stir we're going to raise the heat up to high we want to bring this up to a simmer and before we put the lamb back in we're going to go ahead and add a little bit of brown sugar all right just to balance out that acidity and heat alright so stir that in and then we can place our lamb back in and if using a similar size pot you should have enough liquid to just almost come up to the top it doesn't have to be totally covered this is going to stew for three hours and we're going to turn these several times so as long as you have that much liquid you're okay if you need to add another splash of water don't be afraid don't forget you can always reduce sauces later so once the lamb goes in I want you to turn the heat down to low I want you to cover it tightly and I want you to simmer that very slowly on very low heat for about three hours all right not a bad idea to turn it over once in a while and all you're trying to do and why there's no way to screw up the cooking part of this you're just going to simmer it until the meats tender see how that fork goes right into that meat that's done all right so like I said it's going to take about three hours but don't quote me on it could take two and a half could take four plan accordingly all right at that point I'm gonna go ahead and remove the lamb from the pot you can just cover it with foil while we finish the sauce and finishing the sauce means two things the old skimmin season so we're going to turn the heat up a little bit we want to bring this back to a simmer and we need to skim off all that fat there's a ton of it just take your ladle and skim all the fat off before you serve it all right and besides de fat if I in the top the other thing you should do is taste for seasoning although I highly doubt you're gonna have to do much adjusting but you know what Chuck just in case maybe add a little salt and that's it go ahead and throw your lamb shank on a plate I'm serving mine next to some lentils and rice I'm going to spoon over that incredible sauce I'm gonna garnish with some whole cilantro leaves and there you go authenticity notwithstanding this was a super delicious incredibly tasty very spicy exciting dinner totally fork-tender should just fall right off the bone and just a very complex flavor spicy sweet sour aromatic and that beautiful subtly gamy lamb just the absolute perfect meat for this so I really really hope you give this a try
