 Hogan guys now I'm not quite sure what's more comforting than a nice warm soup on a cold night now it's approaching winter autumn down in the southern hemisphere and I know it was a bit different up for you northerners but I've got a terrific tomato soup recipe I think you'll be very surprised how easy it is to make and how how good it tastes in the end so I hope you guys enjoy it cool beans we're just going to grab a look a deep pan or you can use our large pot and we're just going to put this on a medium heat and once it's heated up we're going to stick in a little bit of oil followed by one medium onion that we've just diced up roughly and three cloves of garlic that once again we just chopped up roughly they don't need to be precise chopping we're going to blend it later so it doesn't really matter and to this we're going to add one carrot and one stick of celery that we've also just chopped up we're just got to cook this on like I said on medium heat until the carrots go nice and soft but they hold their shape and the onions should start and browning little bit get a little bit golden our vegetables have been frying away for around 10-15 minutes so now we can stick in our stock now I've got two cubes of chicken stock that I've just dissolved in a liter of water so we can add this to our our vegetables here following this monistic and 1 400 gram 10 of 10 Tomatoes and to this we can also add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste if you're adding tomato paste you could substitute with tomato ketchup or tomato sauce it'll just add a little bit of our nicer base to it following this we're going to stick in 4 large ripe tomatoes now the riper they are the better so get the really right ones chop them up roughly and then check them into the art pan with everything else give it a stir around and we're just kind of bring this to the boil once a tomato soup is boiling we're just going to turn it down for it to simmer for around 15 minutes this will just give it a chance for anything to soften and really incorporate the flavors together so at this point we can stick in our salt and pepper so make sure you season to taste and I also like to stick in some basil so get a large handful of fresh basil just chop it up willy-nilly doesn't need to be precise and chuck it into our soup and also I like to personally I like to stick in a dash of balsamic vinegar he'll pair really nicely with you tomatoes give it a nice sweetness to you to soup so we can stick in a dash this at the end just before you get to blend it at this point your toes so it should be exactly how you want it so if it's a little bit but you want to add about a little bit of sugar likewise you might want to add a little bit of salt and pepper so you season to your taste and then we could stick this into a blender so blend it all up put it on the high setting for about a minute it'll be a nice smooth consistency now if it's too thick of a serving you're a little bit more runny err add a little bit more water and blend it again it'll really thin it out serve your soup hot a little bit of our basil on top if you wish some nice toasted bread a little bit of butter in there Bob's your uncle so I really hope you enjoy it you can leave out certain steps like the celery the carrots if you want and just stick with the onion and garlic base that's entirely up to you but this is a really simple very very quicker so that can really warm up those at colder nights so I hope you guys enjoyed it feel free to check out any of the other videos I've got a few links there um I don't let I'll see you next time
