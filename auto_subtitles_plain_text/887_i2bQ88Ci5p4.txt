 when I first heard about boneless chicken wings I was like how the heck did they do that then I saw a boneless chicken wing and I'm like nope that's a chicken nugget so the boneless wing is basically a small chicken tender but bigger than popcorn chicken big without chicken lean meat and pays nothing like a chicken wing but that's okay because they're amazing to start cut up some chicken breast meat once in half the long way and then slice the other way into squares then sew your chicken in a brine solution which is a combination of water sugar and salt for six hours you're strapped for time and things tasting good isn't a priority you can skip this step now combine the following dry ingredients into a shallow bowl the secret here is using the cornstarch which will make a more protective crispy coating a similar texture you see with General Tso's chicken the wet ingredients is a standard ratio of egg milk and water for our wing sauce most common folk also known as plebeians just add butter to their favorite hot sauce but Applebee's has a much thicker creamier consistency so if you don't want that watered-down oily look add the ingredients listed along with cornstarch to thicken it up make sure you whisk thoroughly on medium heat until everything dissolves and get a nice creamy thick texture as shown tastes like a puppy to me mmm now take your chicken from the brine and toss into your flour coat it well and then toss it into your egg wash and we're gonna do this twice to get a thick coating one of the tricks of the breading station is to keep your dry hand dry and your wet hand wet over gloves now fry these guys for four minutes to get it partially fried and right before serving give it an additional two minutes for that extra crispy exterior oh my god I want to rub these on my face okay now once you pour the sauce into a big bowl as seen in this video several times already because I like how it looks toss your chicken into this mixture until fully coated good now just grab some of your favorite blue cheese dressing and then add chunks of gorgonzola into it mix it and you got yourself chunky blue cheese serve your chicken on a white plate because any color would be ridiculous pour that crumbly blue cheese mixture into a black ramekin that you borrowed from Applebee's add some celery stalks you've got yourself boneless buffalo wings just like you can get at the restaurant except not dried out and sitting under a heat lamp for 30 minutes oh my god where's our waitress we open this bottle Bombay Sapphire Thank You Leah pour something I monitor my snow too much more okay a little bit wow I love this healthy junk food glass all right you want to know why we get bones wings because there was half off at the beach after 9 p.m. that's turned a weekday there's always great deals that good they smell like down there yeah what are you bloody mary' I mean I know you don't think Bloody Mary without me soon okay oh look at this look at the texture on this thing it's just it's perfect yes sure when I was making the sauce I told you all earlier this smells like Apple B sauce you wanna grab a fork and grab one i cutting mine in half i know that's ridiculous do I want to or no I love chicken I'm going in one bite for the health of it this is exactly what we always create when I go to Applebee's spa you guys have to you have to make these at home all right I'm the realsies do you have anything that you change I have no objection I almost feel like I'm gonna Applebee's you know - the fact that we got served on time we have a great service Applebee's yes all right guys check out this related video and make sure to check out this other one over here you know I'm good check out those related videos and subscribe make sure to hit the subscribe or fight me
