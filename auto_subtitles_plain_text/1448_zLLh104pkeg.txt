 this first dish that I'm gonna show you it's just taking the simple BLT into a new world you see at the restaurant we raise our own hogs and we make our own bacon that's right we make our own bacon and I love bacon but it doesn't have to be homemade as long as it's great quality and when you're shopping for bacon you want to look for some nice there's all kinds of bacon on the Shelf these days try to get it as lean as possible now I said to you earlier about a BLT you're not gonna believe this but we're just gonna take and start grilling some nice pieces of bacon now if you don't have a griddle what you can do is you can just do it in a skillet like I've done here well you can also just do it inside of the oven works great as well I like my bacon really crispy like this sort of rend it out I'm speaking about rendering out you can see how which is sort of rendering out this bacon we're gonna just sort of turn it over and see the lean the leanness of that mmm want to make sure you shop for that lean bacon sometimes it gets lean it's gonna start curling a little bit on you like that you just got to sort of press it back down on your Heat sauce now once you get the bacon for the right Christmas that's you particularly like want to get some of that oil out of there better known as some of that fat but we're just gonna let that be right there and then as I said I really really like my bacon crisp almost to a snap love bacon now here we go with a very basic or at least my basic Emeril's version of the BLT I've made some grilled flatbread because I love grilled flatbread earlier you can use pita bread you just sort of get it a little bit on the grill you don't have too much oil in your skillet or in your pan you just to sort of heat it up a little bit you can just sort of get a little bit of that oil and absorb some of that and just absorb some of that oil like I'm doing right there now it's hot be careful and then you can either warm up your a pita bread or your peasant bread either in the oven inside of the skillet or what I like to do is I like to just heat it up just a little little bit like I'm doing there and I've got some wonderful little bit lettuce that i got and tomatoes well tomatoes are not all the time of the year perfect you know these are okay they're not merely they they taste sort of okay but I'm gonna make them taste taste even better so I'm gonna take our tomatoes and give a little salt a little bit of lots of cracked pepper and then what I did is I've got this beautiful little bib this morning at the market and I'm just gonna lightly season that cuz that's gotta taste good as well with a little salt and a little pepper and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put together my version you see that you see how what that does in the skillet after that it just sort of crisps it up and we can just sort of Pat it get all that excess oil out of there hey get back don't steal my BLT now what we're gonna do is I took a little bit of mayonnaise as we say in New Orleans and I just worked a little bit of saffron a tumeric you can add whatever you like inside of that so I have here a little saffron aioli and we do this occasionally at Emeril's so instead of just a plain old basic mayonnaise I have a little bit of saffron aioli and what I'm gonna do is I'm also gonna add some on my plate and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some lettuce this is emeralds version of BLT and I'm gonna add me some seasoned tomato and then what I also like to do is I got a little bit of herbal you could use whatever you like I'm gonna also use a little bit of grated cheese cuz I love cheese even though that you won't find that at your old local diner like my friends there in Fall River at the AL Max diner and we're gonna put I love bacon we're gonna put a lot of bacon on there whoo and then we're gonna just make a big old sandwich like that and then we're just gonna cut it in half whoo if you want to be nice you see how that looks if you want to be nice you can cut it in quarters and maybe share it with a couple of your friends I don't know if I'm gonna share mine or not hey get back in there bacon all right then what we're gonna do is just sort of set our little oh boy a little bit of lettuce and then we'll just take a little bit of that nice herb like that and a little bit more cheese
