 it wasn't until I had my first bond me that I realized the potential of the same same with me I've always hated always it in Sam Mike's been to Vietnam I never have but even just the American versions I've always eaten sandwiches oh I didn't even get it in Vietnam I didn't even know it existed when I went to Vietnam one night when I first had that thing on American soil it's like why do other sandwiches exist I know it's just so it's so well-balanced it's spicy its juicy its crispy healthy it's got salty vinegary it's get everything in the sandwich you could ever want it's a perfect bite you liver because the Asians mixed with the French now Mike you're probably wondering why I have a grater out here and why I have chicken miss frozen I was out not too long ago Mike and I were at Costco on a job and they're passing that passing out these chicken meatballs and I tried one and it was actually amazing I was like this is Costco chicken meatball is actually really good I was shocked that I saw the potential in the chicken meatball went home that day it was good really what all that yeah I was like I saw the potential how they come on so what happened was I realized how incredible this could be so start making chicken meatball but I have a lot of trouble finding not only good chicken that's ground up but just ground up chicken at all you always see the ground turkey where the chicken meatball has become my favorite meatball above the burger poor granules meow it's hard to get the really good ground chicken it gives the chicken thigh you need to get it from the butcher but apparently this guy's got some technique so I haven't quite figured yeah I've been trying everything you can throw it in a food processor and you can blend you can freeze it a little bit or just do it raw blend it up with the herbs and spices and make great ground chicken that works for it I've done that but what if you don't have food busted I've been trying everything I can have been cutting up the chicken team I've been pounding the gonna get elated fetus popped out of Josh's I thank you I've been pounding the chicken I've been doing a lot lot lot of different things to make this work and I just had a theory last night I was kind of frustrated like aunt figure it out I'm just going to do the pounding I just cereals like what if I froze the chicken and then great I don't know if it's not work it tested if it doesn't work we're just gonna have to do something else but I'm thinking just like cheese you know if you want to be frozen you just give it a great oh my god it's working okay it is working folks I think I am a genius so it may take a little bit effort but we're essentially making our own ground chicken by grating it thing is I went online I was like are there any ways to make ground meat without a meat grinder and without a blender and no one had any answer so what do you what am I gonna do am I gonna sit back and just accept defeat no would I ever accept defeat no oh my lord it works only took us three guys okay no I mean it didn't take that long but we actually I've rented this chicken ground chicken we have a ground chicken all right so I've got the chicken mixture I'm like I need some garlic if you want to cut some garlic up for me smash you smash so this is where you season your chicken and let's say you already had ground chicken you could avoid that whole last step and you can start the video right here and then you'd be good to go you wouldn't be freezing your hands off but I really wanted to try it I actually feel really accomplished everyone's got their own passions in life josh is grating chicken take some ginger a little knob of it take a few cloves of garlic I want some more garlic than that my brother Wow well I want a lot of garlic speed say wow they make it real fine cuz you don't want to necessarily be gnawing on ginger maybe you do I don't know maybe that's your thing and cilantro of course you can eat most of the stem so don't be afraid just have the leaves traditionally when it comes to bond me even though there are a lot of different feelings there's sort of the main and usually pork and they usually have pate which is like liver and there's a little bit of pate in there and there's some kind of you know barbecue poor there's like three type yeah because the pork so this is sort of a little bit more of an American version of it add some salt you can have a little pepper in there if you want we got a lot of garlic and ginger which is it gonna take a little bit away you could add some fish sauce at this point if you want fish sauce would be great classic Vietnamese ingredient very intense but if you use it correctly Oh like gonna get that pan going now that's it that is all we are going to be making got my meat mixture if you want you can just put a little piece in there and test it out how they go I'm gonna make these little like medium sized meatballs I want them to be to cook in the pan without going into the oven but drop them down there you lay your balls down on here and just let them sit on one side until when you pick them up they start to look nice and brown and then at that point once that's happening then you can start to just flip them on the other side oh my goodness gracious and if you do these meatballs right they're not exactly round so you can actually flip them on like you don't just cook them on one side on the other side come on every if I come on all the time outside Oh get them as crispy as you humanly can oh yeah right turns down chicken meatballs I'm telling you if you're not a believer you'll be a believer there's something about the juiciness and the flavor and just just note I did use chicken thigh chicken breasts would not work very well I mean you could try it but chicken thigh is meaty its fatty and it's cheaper it's cheaper and it is better add a little bit of vinegar we're using rice vinegar it's nice and sweet and a little bit of soy shizune oh yeah and interesting and then a little bit of extra salt the soy is salty but we're going to add a little bit of extra salt because this is pickles so what josh is doing here is he's just shaving off the carrot and this is a great technique for instant pickles because it's going to absorb the flavor and it's going to pickle immediately we're going to scrunch it into the sauce and you don't need to have it sit in your fridge or even outside for days and then take some cucumber which is a real gamechanger you got to get in there and scrunch sometimes what they'll do with the quick pickle is they'll shave them first and then toss them in salt and sugar and if you toss them in salt and sugar they'll actually draw all the moisture and then you rinse it off and then throw it in there if you have the time but we want to eat our bun meat now yeah so look what we're doing here we're just scrunching it we're activating the pickle process and I'm telling you instant pickles great / sounds quickl look what we did here look at that quickl below their bow see that instant pickles let's give this a taste mm-hmm giggle ooh our final experience is near we made the meatballs we have the workings for the most perfect sandwich ever created I toasted this bun if you can get a French baguette that's the best but any good bun all right seeing this this is the one thing I felt like was missing and I was like there's something missing about this sandwich you'd be shocked but just raw cucumber if it's not in there it does not taste the same you can leave anything out you can add anything you want but I'm just telling you the best way I think Wow veggies pickled pickled and then fresh cilantro is very important you'll find that on every single bond me you are lordy Lordy Wow won't you buy these bins we made a video before it was sweet chili and zesty mayo pretty much made it just for the sandwich because it's the perfect combination oh lordy you're gonna have to like shove this in there to get it all in the sandwich if you really want to get crazy I saw one time someone even topped with a fried egg Michael this is the moment that the world has been waiting for the world being my stomach in my mouth the first time I set out to make this thing I decided I want to make the entire thing bread included the bread takes a while takes hours to make the bread I was making the bread and midway through I grabbed something that was 400 degrees 450 degrees around my hand by accident probably little high burnt my hands so bad I blacked out I blacked out for a second woke up I could not keep my hand out of ice water from weather two minutes seconds without it like burning horribly I was in horrible pain I remember that didn't care cook the entire meal that was left made all the feelings and everything with one hand so much pain couldn't play guitar can do anything the second I took my first bite it was all worth it try this at home if you need to first do some research and development go out and get a bond me it will blow your mind music to my ears
