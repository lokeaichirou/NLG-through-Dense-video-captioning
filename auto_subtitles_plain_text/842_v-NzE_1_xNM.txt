 [Music] sorry guys and welcome to French guy cooking today a great and delicious example of French cooking it reminds me that never asked before but what does French cuisine mean to you  over complicated windy dashi is over complicated windy dashi is that really what you think this can't go on anymore I must fight and prove you wrong forget the stars in the chest white bread ham and cheese these are the only ingredients you will need today we are making a nation sprite of the popular copper Monsieur as known as a ham and cheese grilled sandwich this recipe is dead simple and incredibly fast to make this very sandwich is supposed to have appeared around 1910 in a cafe in Paris the name itself coq Monsieur it stands for crunch Vista it's supposed to come from a joke made by the owner of the cafe in which he told the customer he had human flesh in the sandwich ok let's gather the ingredients 1 slice of good ham this plant should be good for two reasons one it comes from a delicious ham and two it comes from a higher welfare pork of course now that you've got it was the chicken you got a step up two slices of sandwich bread not too thick otherwise they won't fit sorry fit in what oh come on don't be so impatient now we need two slices of thin cheese I am using go ahead but feel free to use any other melty cheese if you can't find this one or if it's too expensive or if you don't like the taste of it or of course if you hate French and you dislike their food to build the cocky mistress on which I love the ingredients in this exact order bread cheese ham cheese bread we won't cook it in a pan we won't use an oven either in fact we could use a French  Monsieur dedicated appliance or you Monsieur dedicated appliance or you could use a toaster a toaster a toaster now take a sheet of parchment paper three times as wide as your sandwich and twice as told you can also use aluminium foil instead of parchment paper fold it in half width wise place the sandwich on the left edge right above the folding line fold the paper over it if you wrap it tight no leaks will occur it's ready to go in the toaster for three minutes and you need to rely on the smell of it warning the porch and paper is absolutely impossible to burn but but in any case of fire please do not put any word on the toaster I screwed up just unplug the toaster and put a lid on it while it's cooking let's make a simple sauce in a mug mix butter flour and milk in equal proportions season but you get nut mix this could be a great value stir it and place it in the microwave for 30 seconds mix it well and it's ready to go the coq Monsieur is ready use this sauce as a light topping over the grilled sandwich crispy melty totally addictive you might want to eat a couple or maybe a dozen of these in fact we could use more ingredients and make it even more decadent but you would then miss my point which is French cooking can be simple and delicious and painless at the same time I mean that's true all you need is someone that can teach you French recipes in a funny and simple and not so pushy way I don't know keep looking and who knows you might find someone I hope you like this video and I'm glad you like it share it and subscribe for the next video see you around bye bye [Music]
