 hi friends today I want to show you my style of making naan yes naan which I learnt it from my husband but my style of making so dear friends let's start how to make this nan my style so to make this nan first we need 1 cup of all-purpose flour and in this add pinch of salt and sugar you know now nan takes little bit sweeter and little bit salt so add little bit salt and sweet add half a teaspoon of yeast directly we are not using any warm water or anything just mix everything together and in this add some oil also for nons I always use buttermilk 4 pieces you can make it with egg milk anything but Fernan I use buttermilk so here buttermilk and mix it to a soft dough so dear friends here the dough I mixed it see see not too soft not too hard this is perfect for our Nancy just mix it nicely this is sticking to your hand you can just apply little bit of oil on to this also and lastly mix once more so here this is ready so just wrap it with a cover and let it rest for 30 minutes and this will become double in size difference after half an hour of resting our dough see here it is nicely up because we added East it has puffed up nicely remove the cover whatever you call now add some just add some flour onto the table wherever you are making your nonce so just take a small dumpling if you want you can use the rolling pin and make this so friends just roll it into an oval shape or you can make it into a round and you can just pull also whichever way you are comfortable you can make it I am making oval shape like this just make it a bit thin not too thin and now you and stretch just hold this side and stretch upper side non shape and stretch the other side also like this so here our Nando is already see here both - I made it be careful always apply little bit of dry flour down so that when you remove you can get it easily you can just add this is Kalonji that is onion seeds and just press it if you want you can add if you don't want you can just keep this we are not making in any thunder or anything I told know my style so I make it I have a nice iron kadai that is a pan so here I have a nice cover of Idol so what I did instead of using the front side I am just using the back side so this should be nice hot very very hot enough how our thunder will be nice hot enough so this also should be nice hot see so when you put your nan on top of it it should get cooked very fast the similar way of making the room Ali roti so here are narns are ready don't apply any butter because it's it becomes dark so you can just put it directly on the tawa this is going to take just a minute to cook your nan see you can see nice bubbles coming up here so just rotate it to the other side apply nice butter if you want you can just crush some garlic and apply on top of it also then your garlic naan will be ready so here our Narns are ready so just switch off the flame and enjoy this hot Nan's with palak paneer or butter chicken or paneer butter masala whichever is ready at your house just try to make this nice wonderful Lance at your home very simple no you can just make it with your regular tava which you have it at your house and you can get your Hotel style naan mmm Wow these are so soft and nice if you want little bit crispy then you can make your nonce little bit thin then you get your nonce crispy sometimes my son loves Chris penis so I hope you also will do the same thing in your house and enjoy this wonderful nonce so see you in another session with some more recipes thank you you
