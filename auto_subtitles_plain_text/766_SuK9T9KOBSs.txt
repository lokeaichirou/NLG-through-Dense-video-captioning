 welcome back to Paducah Gina today we're going to be making Velata beans they are they're dry ones that need to be soaked overnight they are wonderful for a beautiful hearty meal especially when it's cold this is what they look like so we need to have this soaking overnight in plenty of water so I've had mine soaking and then the next day you just drain the water and put some cleaner water in and you just boil them gently they should take about an hour and a half something like that you'll know when they're tender they taste yummy okay this is very bland there's nothing in there just water and a bit of salt then splitting a little bit that means that they're ready so I'm just gonna taste a little bit mmm they're good so these are ready before we need to do with this money at the moment so we're just gonna get the sauce we're you down so we're gonna get the tomatoes ready I've used fresh tomatoes this time so we kind of chopping my not taking out the seeds don't ask me why because that's what we used to do and I'm sticking to that just cut them into tiny little pieces there why you get less of the skin nobody likes the skin on the tomatoes always use beautiful ripe tomatoes when you're cooking them there's nothing worse than having green tomatoes the sauce will be very acidic so it won't be nice now when I have lots of tomatoes that are very ripe this is what I do I choke them up like this and freeze them from when I need them because when you're cooking Italian they're gonna need a lot of sudden it's always we start with an onion my grandmother used to chop them up in her hands and it was just like this I think it fits any chopping board we have one other ingredient in this today we're gonna use some chorizo delicious it's very very spicy full of flavor so you don't need a lot you only need a couple from cooking for 4 so this is plenty we just need it for flavoring if you can't get this you can always use some speck just I don't know about a hundred grams or something like that and you just chop it up at the same so I'm just gonna chop this up slice it you can either take the skin off or leave it on whatever you prefer now the other ingredient that would go well with this is also celery if you happen to have any lying around and today I have so it's going in that's too thick it's always we start with putting the olive oil in the pan they're always covering the bottom of the pan and I proved it onion in it's nice and hot and we just let them go nice and golden next thing we're gonna drop in is the chorizo all we need to do with this one is just actually only to seal it and we have the fire on medium so it's not gonna cook very violently so here we go this is nice Eliseo now I'm gonna put the celery in and make sure that you always use the tender pieces of the celery like they keep the pieces on the inside mmm this smells divine put a little bit of salt just put about half a teaspoon because the turrets is quite tasty now one of the key things in cooking is you never ever put too much salt always put a little bit at a time and keep tasting now we're just waiting for the onion to be translucent and the celery half cooked at least here we go the chorizo is nicely cooked - they don't take long to cook anyway it's all done all we need to do now is the put the tomatoes here we go once the tomatoes all nicely cooked we add a little water in ten minutes it should be ready Oh beautiful this is ready I don't think it needs a new water usually I need to put a little bit of water because it cooks too much the tomato but today it didn't beautiful this is ready for the beans now you can see the tomatoes all nicely cooked the skins are all out and then we're gonna put the beans in now they don't have to be fully drained for this next step just drain as much as you can from with a ladle and just pop them in because we do want a little bit more liquid this is just perfect for winter's night this doesn't have to cook any more this is just a bit just mixing and blending and we're trying to get the right moisture in here we don't want it to be too dry because when we put the pasta then it'll become drier because of this pasta will soak up some of the liquid maybe I should have put it into the other pot which I think I will do this is a little bit small because I it doesn't give you any room to put the pasturing okay now the pasta is ready so all we got to do is just put it in and blend everything together we don't want to drain it because we don't want it to be too dry so I'm only gonna spoon it on with this mix it all through and it's ready if it gets a little bit too dry then you can add a bit of water that we saved or if you didn't save it you can use a bit of the water from the pasta now every time I'll cook this reminds me of this song that's amore you know that Victor Dean Martin says pasta fazool this is the dish and it is absolutely beautiful it's gonna make you drool and you're gonna bawl more and more special a cold winter's night there you go peanut Kachinas pasta fagioli enjoy it
