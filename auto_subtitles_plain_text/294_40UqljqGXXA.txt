 I'm the colonel I'm from Japan I was born and raised in Takayama just a very small town in Japan and started my career in Ibaraki working for the restaurant also named as kisaku I really like the name the restaurant I used to work for in Japan so I asked them to use their name as my restaurant basically means easygoing Frank you know down earth yeah that's what I want miso soup is the it's a soup widely serve in Japan pretty much with any kind of meal like I usually eat with my breakfast and almost any any kind of dinner combination lunch combination it's basically it's a family food you know it's a home cooking so if you eat three times at home it's definitely have three times a day any reason any household a different style so as long as you you know make them drop part correctly you can just do whatever you want after that you know you actually start the water with kombu in it and then you want to follow the water with the kombu first kombu actually contains a lot of the amino acid to give you a depth of the flavor that the body dough itself doesn't give you so adding a kombu in it it gets a little bit more body under suit when you see enough kombu coverage flavor in a broth to add bonito in it and immediately turn the heat really weak otherwise you boil it with the out you know with the high heat a long time but it'll give you a little bit of the kind of bitterness that's just basically you know out of the Japanese food you cook on most of the food with dashi so you cook visible you cook with dashi you make soup you make with - you it's kind of you know soup base piece of the future it has some vegetable tofu or sort of some sort of the vegetable protein plus has no fat we usually serve it very simple basically the wakame seaweed scallion and tofu but you know you can do a whole bunch of other stuff like my kids really like the potato miso soup at my home so when we do it we cook the potato first make a soup and put the potato in there so you know the rate depends whatever you want to put in it so you simmer it with the low heat while you rest of the process now you have some miss Elaina to the flavor you want but you have to be careful like you know me so sometimes missile is not completely dissolved when you taste it and after all that you know check missiles get this all but get saltier so it gotta be careful usually when I do it what I stop before it completely there because you know I'm dissolved me so it's going to be eventually dissolved in the suit yeah then yeah for lunch for dinner steamed rice miso soup and one or two vegetable dishes said so beetle soup is a huge part of our meal anytime
