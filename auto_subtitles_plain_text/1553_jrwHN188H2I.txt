 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens fast food Friday today we are going to be making something so quick so easy to do and best of all it is full of flavor and you will want more and more and more of course I'm talking about salt and pepper squid he's got budget feel ma there's what you want where's this fast food Friday's what else could he share it's because kitchen where satisfying meals are prepared so guys the first thing that we're going to do to get started on our salt and pepper squid is just into one of these Ziploc bags I'm going to be putting in some plain flour straight into the bag now if you don't have one of these Ziploc bags you could just do this in a small plastic bag so just make a well they're in the bag and now I'm going to season really well oh good helping of some salt and some pepper as well so once you've done that with the salt and pepper just give it a good shake around there with the flour so guys obviously we're going to be using some squid tubes now you can get these at your supermarket they're cleaned already for you just make sure there aren't any cuts or tears in them and that they're clean on the inside now what I want you to do with a really sharp knife and very slowly and about a five millimeter thickness I want you to cut some rings just like that like an onion ring and just keep repeating that process with your squid shoes so once we've cut up our squid rings what I want to do now is just start dropping them into the bag just like that and just shape the bag just like that make sure the flour covers all the squid rings and then once you've finished all you got to do is just pull them out and that's what you're left with just like that now put them aside on a plate and continue with the rest of the squid rings so we're going to start deep frying our squid rings so just into a saucepan I've got some vegetable oil and I'm heating it up on a medium to high heat and you'll know when the oil is ready to fry if you just drop one of the squid rings just in there and if it starts to sizzle away you know it's ready so our oil is now ready guys and I'm going to be putting in our squid rings just be very very very careful now these are only going to need about two or three minutes just until they're nice and golden brown on the outside and just cooked through if you overcook them they're going to be really rubbery it's going to be eating like a rubber band and after the cooking time two to three minutes all I want you to do is just take them out and drain them on a plate with some paper towel so guys just before we get stuck into our salt and pepper squid the last thing that we have to do is very very important just another helping of some salt and also just to squeeze especially while they're still warm just a squeeze of some lemon juice just over the top let's get stuck in one of these bad boys YUM Oh oh look at that that beautiful white flesh in the middle the saltiness this is this is the onion ring of the sea all the ingredients are below give this one a go you will not be disappointed I guarantee you you guys take care and I'll see you this Monday for our Christmas special starting because it's Christmas and we're going to start our Christmas menu so until then you guys take care
