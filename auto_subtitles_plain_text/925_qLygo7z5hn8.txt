 [Music] hello this is chef Justin with howdini dot-com today we're gonna do a very simple breakfast that everybody out there is familiar with scrambled eggs so of course we got eggs we got butter but ask yourself something do you use milk or water to mix with your eggs milk right wrong answer you use water the eggs get a lot flow a lot more fluffy and they don't brown on the bottom so of course we got water this time instead of milk so we're gonna start now by cracking two eggs into it into a mixing bowl just like this there's one here's two we're just gonna add in just a little bit of water here you can just eyeball this just however you like we're just gonna beat these together just with a fork really simple wrist motion here just like this last little bit out that's okay more fun that way right okay got our eggs mixed up so now we're gonna take the butter just like this we're gonna put this just into the bottom of the pan to melt and it's gonna melt down really quick now so we're just gonna give this just a quick shake just to kind of cover the bottom of the pan with the butter and of course from here then and goes the egg just like this okay you can see here since we got a really hot pan that these eggs are gonna cook lightning-fast so we're gonna get the H is moving just to just to make sure they don't burn we're going to mix this around just a little bit you can see the eggs are already starting to come together here in the scramble form we're gonna keep moving these around just a little bit the different edges are gonna continue to cook themselves together give it that really nice you can see by using the water of how dense and how how really nicely they're coming together and of course again the water is going to prevent them from browning as they usually would when you use milk so again we're it's kind of rustling these together just kind of keeping it moving just like this then once it's the majority of the eggs on the outside are finished and it starting to become one specific piece like this you can start folding them over just so then the undersides get done then of course whether or not you wanted hold you want to dice up you can just kind of cut them apart just like this of course you still continuing to move these around just like this making sure the inside always of these of these covered up eggs here are always done because you never want to find yourself eating a raw egg very bad peon just doesn't taste good either now these are looking just about done so right now we're gonna pull these off the heat just like this and we're gonna throw these onto a plate right over here just like that now you got the eggs on the plate you can do just simply like your favorite kind of cheese like right now I have romano cheese so we're just going to kind of sprinkle this right over the top here just like this and also even if you want to garnish with a little bit of parsley on top salt and pepper of course and for whatever reason some people like maple syrup on top I have no idea why but just like this you have a very simple classic American scrambled eggs dish for breakfast
