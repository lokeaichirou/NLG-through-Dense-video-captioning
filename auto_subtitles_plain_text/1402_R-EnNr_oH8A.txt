 so today we're going to cook Korean bulgogi it's a national dish and one of Korea's best love exports but surprisingly easy to make so today we're going to use a feather blade steak or you can also use skirt he's a relatively cheap cut and the Korean people use because the soy marinated we're going to make to make beef bulgogi overpowers the flavored beef so you don't need to waste your money buying expensive selling for this dish and for the marinade all you need spreaders would be easy is spring onion finely chopped spring onion finely chopped or minced garlic a touch of sugar and pear salt pepper sesame oil and soy sauce so now we're going to make the marinade I'm starting with 3 tablespoons of soy sauce 1 2 3 up one in a whole tablespoon of sesame oil it's Korean sesame oil very very full flavor so one very good some sugar so what about the same so one and a half tablespoons of sugar mix that around spring onion finely chopped um I tend to use quite a lot of this but maybe 2 tbsp something like that and then I mean Korean so heavy on the garlic what maybe for all questioners might want to use it up but this is quite a little garlic so it's about 10 to full tablespoons I'm back I'm going to do is we're going to great to purse I tend to like my wolverine right sweet so he's a lot of koreans also use pear juice or apple juice or fri to use fresh pair so i like using free but also I like using it because pair actually breaks down the enzymes in meat and makes it sort up so then you get a really kind of quite a gourmet total flamer comment pink be just break that all in there we go what make it really nice now so thief the layout on to the chopping board if you is actually best to cut it into Carnell if you cut against the grain again that will make it much more tender so always to remember to cut against the grain small thin slices which are long long so I've caught up all the beef and we're nearly get to go I'm just going to have a last taste of this marinade and see if it needs anything else mmm really nice so but I think it needs a touch more do you have had any puppy up so again if we decided about 2 teaspoons maybe even know very good perfect all right so we'll get deep mix it all around good distribution and then be best marinade it surface so we're gonna cut the beef in this container i marinate it for up to an hour in fridge and actually last time when it's in room temperature you really probably need about 30 minutes or so but obviously if you were married it for longer no one or two hours it's absolutely fine to do so we'll just put that in the fridge for an hour although we're going to keep it while waiting for the beef to finish my anything we're going to cut up an onion so we chop it into car then this cool so into a clip of me and then we slice it extremely thin me and then we will fry it with the beef it just adds a little bit more depth of flavor now what we're going to do is the Beast finished marinating so we're going to bright and then we're also going to fry the onions that we just chopped they're actually go on top three for lease of it so we do cook them separately I'm just going to cook the onion first so if you just use a little grape seed oil or vegetable ready to eat up I'm going to fry the onions until until they go time transfer so just add that little bit of sweetness and here we go yours warmed up no medium heat so you don't wanna take so so again little vegetable rapeseed oil in this case perhaps it also works very well it's an unflavored oil so it doesn't spoil hey we've got upbeat nicely marinated and I guess the thing to do is not to put this all in line though when i click it bit by bit so report is heated heat it up head up even eight late onions going to go I'll see the final product you know it's great so nice great so you can achieve great served with any kind of korean of course all heavily kitty i also you can also serve this will go be with a five chili paste which can also be made a phone call someday but i just like to enjoy it as it is your favor nicely what we don't want to do is overcook this is obviously nice time to be that's been it's been softened and made under by the pair I think this batch is ready to go put down on a plate here is beef bulgogi you just serve it on a plate put the fried onions on top and there may be a little bit of spring onion and if you're really going out to town also a little bit of sesame seeds just for decoration enjoy with weiss kimchi and a nice cool glass of beer thank you
