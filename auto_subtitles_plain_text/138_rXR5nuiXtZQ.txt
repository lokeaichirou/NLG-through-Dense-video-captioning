 hey everyone it's off today I'm going to show you how to make a very easy and popular dish called Pad Thai first you want to soak your rice noodle in some warm water for about 30 to 40 minutes or so just until it's al dente make sure you watch and kind of feel it when it's pliable but not too soft you want to drain it and set it aside while your noodles are soaking you want to work on your pad thai sauce I have here some concentrated cooking tamarind and I'm going to add take a quarter cup of that and mix it with one cup of water I'm going to add this into a pot here and I didn't show it but I actually added in 3/4 of a cup of palm sugar one cup of water and I just added 1/2 a cup of fish sauce then you just mix this all up to combine it's very very important that you cook this outside if you have like an outdoor burner or whatnot if you try to cook this inside oh my goodness this stuff stinks it stank it will make your house smell like hot booty on a Midsummer's day so this is me cooking it outside in about 30 minutes so for the 30 minutes I had the lid on but not completely all the way and left a little crack to let some of that you know steam escape and you want to make sure you keep it at a good rolling boil and stir it often to prevent burning and here's the sauce once it's cooled down completely it's nice and syrupy and this is what you need to get that good color and for it to stick to the noodles while your stir frying next you want to add in some chopped garlic into some peanut oil and you want to stir fry this for a couple of seconds and next I'm adding in my shrimp that I had marinating in some of my sauce about a couple of tablespoons maybe two or three tablespoons for a 1 pound of shrimp 1 once it's almost completely cooked through set it aside using that same wok I'm adding in my noodles I didn't mention that you want to make sure you cook this in batches so the sauce that I provided earlier the amount is good for 3 or 4 batches so you want to take some noodles 2 handfuls add in to your wok add a little bit of water and continue to stir for I don't know a minute or so and then I'm going to add in some of my pad thai sauce I don't measure how much just taste check it I add about a ladle at a time probably a little and a half for this batch that I added here and then I'm also going to add in for some red coloring I'm going to take one tablespoon of ground chili paste and I'm adding in a quarter cup of paprika and I'm going to toss it in here pretty quickly and it's right there now if your noodles are a little bit harder than you wanted them to be then go ahead and just keep stir frying and adding in a little bit of warm water at a time until it's nice and soft but again not too mushy because you want to do this all at about a medium-high heat it looks like my noodles are right where I want them to be I'm going to taste check to see if it needs more sauce and it tastes good to me so now I am going to go ahead and add in my shrimp I'm not adding in all the shrimp that I made earlier again I'm making this in batches okay so I'm going to make a well in the middle and I'm going to crack in two eggs and I don't want to stir it just yet I want to have both white and yellow parts you know mixed in among the pad thai so give it about a minute or so and then start to stir-fry or scramble it a little bit just to give it some of the nice color within your Pad Thai and then again just stir to combine everything is coming together quite nicely so I turned out the heat now I'm adding in some fresh bean sprouts you can add some just for the garnish as well but I'm going to do both because I like some actually and it cook down just a little bit in my Pad Thai and that's all folks just garnish the way you like some fresh chives bean sprouts ground roasted peanuts and chili paste or chili powder don't forget a generous amount or squeezing of lime when you're good to go thanks for watching bye
