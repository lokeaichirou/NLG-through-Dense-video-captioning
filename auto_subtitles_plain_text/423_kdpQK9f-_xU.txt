 hey everybody is froz and in this video I'm making my southern fried chicken it is so good very easy to make you do not need a whole lot of ingredients and guess what I think it's better than Popeyes that's right so I want you to give this recipe a try there's everything that you will need let's get to it so I'm starting off with my chicken I'm using chicken thighs and chicken legs you can use whatever pieces you want and I'm just going to start off by trimming all the excess skin and all the fat that we do not need you don't need that so get rid of it wash your chicken under cool water and now we're going to just brine our chicken in buttermilk I'm not going to add any fancy spices to this buttermilk no salt none of that you don't need it because buttermilk is salty enough so all you need is buttermilk for this step cover this chicken set it in the refrigerator for three whole hours now we're going to remove the chicken from the buttermilk don't rinse it or anything just remove it from that buttermilk and now we're going to season it so I'm starting off with my poultry seasoning I'm going to add a teaspoon of my garlic powder a teaspoon of my onion powder at this time some black pepper now I'm going to add my smoked paprika so I'm going to use my hands to just rub all those seasonings in and I'm going to rub the bottom and the top so all surfaces of that chicken set your chicken aside and let's work on our flour I like to season my flour it really pains me when I PC people seize my chicken and don't season the flour so now we're going to add some white pepper the rest of our garlic powder the rest of our onion powder a little bit of salt and just use your hands to make sure everything is well throughout that flatworm so grab your chicken now you're going to coat your chicken with the flour and we're actually going to coat all of our chicken pieces so coat set it aside then coat it again so here's my oil I'm using canola you can use corn oil or peanut oil I never use peanut oil if you have let me know what you think of that but my oil is on 360 I'm going to deep fry the chicken and be sure not to over crowd your pan or deep fryer otherwise your chicken will not cook evenly so this is the finished look of my chicken is nice and golden brown and you know I have to show you the inside is nice and moist and that is completely done a lot of people like it's too moist to be all the way done baby we brined it in buttermilk so it's going to be moist look no blood no nothing it is completely done and good to go crispy skin nice juicy meat and that's it I want to know what you want me to make next so leave that down below please give this video a thumbs up subscribe if you have not already and be sure to come by I heart recipes every Tuesday and Saturdays for new video recipes
