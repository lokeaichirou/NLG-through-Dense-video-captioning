 you're gonna love this one I've literally never met anyone that doesn't love laksa it's kind of like a soup calm curry you got peanuts you've got citrus and beautiful crispy chicken get yourself about that much grease proof paper empty your chicken thighs onto the paper salt pepper there a heat teaspoon of five-spice just move the chicken around to coat it bash it up your Pender rising and you're also making the flavors really stick to it we're going to go in to the griddle pan here that's going to cook away and job is a good squash take the end off where the fat beer ends just go straight down leave the skin on don't want about a liter of boiling water into my pan whoo we're going to add one chicken organic stock cube I've got a grater and just before this is going to give your broth your soup wonderful body 1 red chili goes in a thumb-sized piece of ginger coriander here these stalks are fantastic and then spring onions just three or four go in and then a couple of garlic cloves about a tablespoon of soy sauce some kaffir lime leaves getting a nice teaspoon of peanut butter a tablespoon sesame oil tablespoon of fish sauce goes in and then last but not least I've got some tumeric a nice Heat teaspoon and that's going to give it the most fantastic color now I'm just gonna wash all of this up and just put that in and it's gonna be like a big bomb going off the flavors the brightness the zestiness you can serve laksa with rice if you want but I think it's more classic to do it with rice noodles you can get them everywhere so I'm just gonna bug in 300 grams of that so they're going to cook away I've got some coconut milk last thing to go in two bunches of asparagus nice big chunks like that squeeze in the juice of one lime gorgeous we're going to go for one tablespoon of honey over the meat and we want to basically sesame coat and glaze these chicken thighs the pan screaming hot so we go in with a lime juice see our lovely it's looking give it a shake turn it over finish off with a last sprinkle of coriander and if you're a chili freak like me scatter some on for a little extra kick a little plate a heaven right there
