 pressure cooker pasta fagioli is what we're making today Bluffs people are scared of using a pressure cooker in the kitchen it's a really handy tool to be able to cook things very quickly what it does is it seals and by using pressure and steam it cooks things that would normally have to cook for a long period of time much faster so there's a couple of important parts to the pressure cooker the lid and the actual pot part you can see on the pot there's flanges all the way around which lock everything together as well as that there's also a locking pin so once you put the lid on and lock it into place there's a pin that'll come up as it comes in to pressure which is going to make sure that this stays nice and sealed and safe so you can't open it so to start cooking my pasta fagioli I have some pancetta here pancetta is similar to bacon it's not smoked though it's just cured it's a salty bacon with no smoke flavor so I'm gonna put this in to start and what I want to do you don't need oil in this we want to render out some of the fat from our pancetta so I just want to put this into a dry pan over kind of medium-high heat you just want to sweat this a little bit and saute it to get those fats to come out kind of crisp it up a little bit and get some of that delicious pancetta bacon flavor into the base of our our pasta today some of the other things that we're gonna put in I have some carrots celery and onions those are gonna go in just after the pancetta have to a penci out of crisps a little bit and we'll stir those in and start sauteing those as well so onions just finely diced onion a little bit of carrot and celery these are the base for most things that you cook they they tie everything together really nicely again just stir this so while this is cooking I'll add my dry spices I have some basil oregano dried basil dried oregano and marjoram we're gonna give you that nice base sort of Italian flavors we're gonna add a little bit of chopped garlic and once you add your chopped garlic you want to be careful that you stir it lots garlic has a very high sugar content so it has a tendency to burn so make sure that you keep moving it around the bottom of your pot and then the last thing is a bay leaf just one bay leaf dried or fresh if it's fresh I like to kind of crack it a little bit to help the flavors and oils come out of it we'll just throw that in whole and at the end of the cooking process we'll have to remember to take that out so they're just gonna saute together until your vegetables are soft once your vegetables get kind of soft your onions start to get translucent we're just going to throw a little bit of white wine in and the white wine is gonna help us deglaze the bottom of the pan get all those great pancetta flavors tie everything together if you didn't have wine or you didn't want to use one you could certainly use a little bit of stock or even water you just want to make sure that you get all those little bits off the bottom of your pan and then you want to bring this up to over a medium-high heat and reduce the liquid until it's almost gone you want to cook out as much of that wine as you can okay so my wine is almost reduced I've reduced this so it's almost dry again as you can see there's the dried spices and the carrots the vegetables in there onions celery pancetta are all really really great so what I want to do now is add my soaked beans these are dry cannellini beans you can buy dried beans at most grocery stores or a bulk store they're super inexpensive they last forever and then what we did here was soaked them overnight so we filled them up with you know large nonreactive Bowl covered them with cold water and let them sit in the fridge for about 24 hours and what that does is helps them grow it they almost double in size they start absorbing some water and then they'll cook a lot more evenly so to cook these soaked beans I just want to put them into my pressure cooker now on top of that I'm gonna pour in some chicken stock or chicken broth so we'll pour that in and now I want to bring this up to a boil and at this point this is where we're gonna start utilizing the pressure in the pressure cooker so you want to bring this up to a boil before we put the lid on so over high heat this is gonna start heating up so the lid now has a couple of parts and what this is going to do is go to we're gonna put it on and I'll talk a little bit about the lid so before you put your pressure cooker on you always want to make sure that you check this rubber seal and make sure that it's in good repair there's no cracks or signs where on it there's a safety valve which will is there for safety there's a little bit of a steam release valve which controls how much steam goes off and on the other side of that it's it's a bobber and this will rock back and forth and just control the amount of steam that's coming out of the pressure cooker and the last thing is this safety valve so this is actually a safety pin that once your pressure cooker comes up to pressure this pin will push up and it locks everything in place so that you can't open the lid there's actually a safety mechanism built into this so to put the lid on you can see this is flanged and then there is the flanges on the top of your pressure cooker so what I want to do is there's a little arrow and you want to line up the arrow on the handle and on the lid okay line up very nicely and then the handle comes together in two pieces and locks into place once it's locked into place we can place our Babur on top and we'll just wait for the safety pin to come up once the pin comes up that means you have achieved high pressure at that point you want to adjust your heat to control the pin to still be risen so that you know you're at high pressure and not letting it fall and once the pin comes up this is gonna cook for 17 minutes so in 17 minutes we're gonna go from soaked beans to completely cooked beans that are tender all the way through so our pasta fagioli has been cooking in the pressure cooker for 17 minutes at high pressure I've turned it off the heat and cooled it down completely so that the the safety mechanism has unlocked so now I can safely open the lid it'll open no problem and it's still hot in there you can see the steam still coming out my beans should be cooked so that they're nice and tender all of those flavors have imparted into the beans so now what I want to do is stir in some canned tomatoes we like to use San Marzano styles canned tomatoes it's an Italian style tomato that comes packed in tomato juice as opposed to water some brands of tomatoes canned tomatoes come packed with water the ones that say San Marzano or the San Marzano tomatoes from Italy are generally a higher quality and it will give you a better product in the end so I'm just gonna pour these through some tomato and then I'm gonna turn it back on the heat and leave this uncovered so I've my can of tomato and then I have a cup of pasta as well we're using elbow macaroni but you could use any small pasta just to cook through this is gonna help absorb some of the liquid and make a delicious dish so now what I want to do is this is gonna take as long as the pasta takes so about nine minutes to cook the past all the way through I just want to stir it around bring it up to a high heat the liquid is going to boil away those tomatoes are going to break down it will give you a beautiful pasta product that is best served right away so very simple dish that you can serve to your
