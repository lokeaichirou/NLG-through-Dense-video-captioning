 hey guys I want to share with you a really easy minestrone recipe that I think tastes a lot like olive garden so the first thing you want to do is add about 3 tablespoons of olive oil to a large pot to that you're going to add onion I have about a cup and a half it's a medium onion and garlic now you can choose as much garlic as you like we put in about a whole bulb of it we really enjoy it though so you could do as little or as much as you like and then just start to saut√© it until the onions start to get a little soft to there you're gonna add your veggies and this is where you can kind of do whatever you want we've got about a cup of green beans I'm about a cup and a half of green means a cup of celery and then Deacon cut our zucchini but I've got about a cup maybe a cup and a half of zucchini see lookout cute he did a pretty good job he'll actually he did a really good job for being three now add those veggies to your pot and stir them up you're just gonna want to cook them for maybe about five minutes on medium then you're gonna need four cups of vegetable broth and four cups of water a can of white kidney beans and then regular kidney beans and then two cans of diced tomatoes and the 14 out sighs I keep the juice in so I don't drain the tomatoes about a cup of shredded carrot and then you also need basil oregano salt and pepper add the liquid to your pot again it's four cups of vegetable broth and you have to use vegetable broth and then four cups of water add your rinsed beans and then give it a good stir to that chill add your carrot again if you really like carrots add lots of carrots if you don't like carrot and no matter at all it's a very flexible recipe now you're going to add as much or as little of each of the seasonings for the basil and oregano we did about two teaspoons each the pepper we go pretty light on just for the kids so about a half of a teaspoon and then about a teaspoon or so of salt so it just it's all to your taste now add your spices and give it a good stir and you'll want to cook this and a very you know low kind of summer before but you know about medium heat for about a half hour so until everything starts to soft you know to sample green bean then you want to add your spinach you can use anywhere to three to four cups of spinach it totally just depends on how much your family likes it we personally love spinach so we added you know closer to four cups so as soon as you get all of your spinach kind of wilted down so that you have space of your plot again you're going to want to add your pasta this is the one that we're using shells would be ideal Trader Joe's just didn't happen to have them so this is what we're using and we're using about three quarters of a cup so you'll want to get those all mixed in really well and then just let them cook this could take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes depending on your pasta just and how done you want your pasta so it's just kind of up to you and then we like it to be a little bit harder of a soup less little less brothy so this is the way we like ours you could add more broth if you want it and that's it that is the finished product that is our my homemade minestrone recipe we add Parmesan or this is this is the one we use today it was a VA home a manchego I'm not sure anyways it's even better the next day and it makes for a great freezer meal
