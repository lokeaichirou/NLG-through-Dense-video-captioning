 [Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm gonna show you how to make mashed potatoes but with a very very delicious twist we're gonna make a rosemary infused roasted garlic to go with it in it so so good I can't even describe it but first thing I'm gonna do is roast the garlic and you want to pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees get there either way second thing you wanna do is take two heads of garlic and we're just gonna cut them in half just like so you want to expose the actual garlic cloves awesome I'm gonna put them on here bottom side down put a touch of olive oil on them sprinkle a little salt perfect and then we're gonna take some rosemary cut it in half and what that's gonna do is infuse the garlic with rosemary and it's so incredible I can't even describe it a little more olive oil you want to keep things very very moist put the tops back on you can just they don't go perfectly on there just make them fit touch more and you just want to make a nice tight package just like that and you want to put these in the oven 400 degrees for about 45 to 50 minutes until the garlic cloves are very very soft and kind of golden and they've got really really nutty and delicious now while the garlic is roasting in the oven what we're gonna work on is peeling our potatoes and getting them to cooking and I'm just using a regular sort of baking potato you can use any kind of potato you want and if you knew if you using like a baby Yukon Golds or little tiny ones you don't even have to bother peeling them I don't know why I'm doing all the peels here when I specifically have a little plate for the peels now what I'm gonna do and I'm I'm going to cut the potatoes really big I cut them in half I leave them kind of big because I love using a potato ricer to make these really fluffy and just kind of I don't like lumpy mashed potatoes if you do you can just use a regular steam standard sort of masher and just mash them to the consistency you like I like mine super smooth and fluffy so I'm going to use a potato ricer I'm just going to cut these in half any little bit that's leftover I don't worry about it because the potato ricer actually catches it from going and from getting you know kind of pureed up it's going to cut that piece so I'm just gonna peel my potatoes and I'm gonna cover them with water and get them cooking until they're nice and fork tender if they're kind of big like this to probably take about thirty minutes or so you come smaller to take a lot less I just took some cream and butter and I've melted it here in the same pan I used to cook my mashed potatoes my potatoes I should say they're not mashed yet these are my potatoes that I've cooked and they're now tender and garlic and rosemary is that in the oven I'm letting it cool for just a few minutes when I mash my potatoes and using a rice cert this is where I'm one of my favorite tools in the kitchen I'm just going to get my potatoes see that this makes the potatoes so incredibly fluffy it's unbelievable and like I said I love a good fluffy fluffy potatoes not lumpy mashed potato so make sure to scrape anything that's been left behind perfect all right setting this aside next unbaling know the garlic smells so amazing oh look at that now it's like garlic candy and all you do is just squeeze and it comes right out and it comes out tasting like sweet kind of nutty oh it's just so good so so good what I often do is I make a few of these and then I serve them alongside like toasted baguette and then you just spread it on in like it's like butter so amazing so good so just squeeze all of you garlic cloves into mashed potatoes that's it but so infused but that rosemary is amazing okay we have this now we need to season it with salt and pepper because potatoes need salt to bring them back to life in my opinion they taste like nothing unless there's some salt in there I love lots of ground black pepper with my mashed potatoes however my mother used to like white pepper with hurt hers so you can choose whatever you like and I have some cream and butter here and I'm just gonna mix this up that is amazing that's perfect I don't like a tube what's mashed potato either I'm a very picky mashed potato eater we're gonna taste this for seasoning Wow right on the money hmm I left those garlic cloves kind of chunky because I want to be able to literally bite down on one none there there's any biting going on because it's so soft but I want to be able to get a heat the clove of it in my mouth because it's not garlicky at this point it's just like sweet nutty mmm-hmm so uh that's about it I'm just gonna plate this up so amazing I'm just gonna give this one more bite mmm that it's a dinner in itself so good so much flavor so comforting I couldn't ask for anything better I hope you guys have enjoyed spending time with me so get this fries to paint on the recipes check out my website at www.att.com/biz bye-bye you
