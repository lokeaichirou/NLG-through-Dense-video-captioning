 [Music] assalamu alaikum and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan whenever I'm shopping in the Middle East or North Africa I love to eat the falafel and my Egyptian colleagues tell me that they make the best falafel but then every Egyptian man I've ever met has told me he's a really good cook cannot be true there are many variations of falafel and I'm just going to show you a simple one but you can look at my website for different versions I've taken 250 grams of dried chickpeas and I've soaked them overnight a word of warning never never never use tinned chickpeas because this happens I've got one small onion coarsely chopped 2 cloves of garlic coarsely chopped 2 teaspoons each of coriander powder and cumin powder a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a cup of freshly chopped coriander first thing I'm gonna do is process the chickpeas and I've got a 1 liter processor [Applause] go scrape around approach this things for about a minute quite fining texture no I process the other half when you've processed your chickpeas process together the onion and the garlic they'll add it into your chickpeas now adding the coriander and the hurt and spices and mix well once it's all nicely mixed take a piece about the size of a golf ball and press it firmly into a ball shape okay that looks good and you should be able to make about 14 or 15 falafel now you can show them fry these if you like but I'm going to deep-fry mine at 180 degrees C for about three minutes after three minutes remove from the oil and drain on some kitchen paper now that I've got my falafel I need to make some dips promoting any sauce I've got six tablespoons of tahini paste the juice of a lemon one crushed clove of garlic and half a teaspoon of salt I'll just mix all these together and give them a good whisk and you should end up with this lovely creamy dip for a cucumber mint dip start with half a cucumber peel it off scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon then grate the flesh put the flesh in a bowl add in one crushed garlic clove about two tablespoons of freshly chopped mint and a cup of yogurt then mix well make sense add falafel with a cucumber mint tip under tahini sauce great for a supper someone great mystery that remains from all of this is whether or not Egyptian men are better cooks and Egyptian women all are Egyptian men simply full of true next time in titli's busy kitchen with me today hard until next time what happens [Music]
