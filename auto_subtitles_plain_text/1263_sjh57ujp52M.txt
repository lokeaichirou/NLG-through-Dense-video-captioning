 we're going to be cooking some cop today but you can do exactly the same recipe with haddock now we've got the white fish now I've actually got Philips and there's no skin and you know supposedly no bones as well but be careful now what we're going to do is make up a nice little batter mix using plain flour and I've got a little bit of water it's a fizzy water to get some bubbles in there because it means you get a nice light and crusty outside and you get really lovely fish in the middle so I've chopped me caught up what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna season it a little bit so and I'm gonna use a bit of red pepper oil now what I'm gonna do is turn it round and season it exactly the same on the other side so I've got it all chopped up seasoned on both sides let Nick so I'm going to work on is the flour now I'm using plain flour but what I'm going to do is put a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper it's really if you can season it all the way through it really adds to the flavor a good bit of salt and pepper in there just give that a light stir and that's ready Ferb dip in the fishing I'm gonna move that aside and then what we can do is get on with the batter mix now to make the batter mix it's really very simple again you just use a bit of plain flour with the flour again put a bit of salt and pepper seasoning dippers all the way through on the season your food so the next ingredient to go in is the fizzy water so just spring water yesterday in there the bubbles really make it a lot better so put a little bit in I'm gonna use a whisk for actually whisking it out I can tell straight oh I need more more water in there and just whisk this up until you get it all obviously mixed out and try and get the lumps out you need a little bit more flour in there start look about right now it's thickened up slightly anyway so we get on with the cooking I've got a nonstick frying pan now I'm just gonna put some oil just going to use Norwood sunflower oil but you want to put a fair amount because you need to cook the fish really I mean obviously if you've got a deep fat fryer then great but I haven't got one of those so I'm just going to let that get hot depends getting really nice and hot now I can see all those sort of bubbles forming at the bottom there so I'm just gonna put the the flour all around the fish try and get it everywhere give it a shake off and then what you do is drop it into the batter mix and then when you've got the foil just drop it in a nice thing and put them in slowly because it it allows the batter to actually form a crust if you put it in too quick it it calls the oil all down it's gonna do free actually keep it simple and we're gonna put a little bit of oil one top just to get a bit of a crust so we can flip them over now I've got the fish in there turn it down to us or medium heat rather than the very high well we've got a ton about a medium then one be turning on you know the outside is all nicely encapsulated early official written inside this may be really delicious I'm just gonna cook this for about two minutes on this side and I'm gonna flip it over for another two minutes what we're looking to do is to get a nice golden-brown color nice crispy coating put the fruit cut them in turn these over and then of my turnovers one more time in the end really nice stick golden brown so I just carry on listening for two minutes on this side and then we'll flip them over one more time so total cook time really is about five minutes on a medium heat stopping cooking for about four minutes gonna whip those over ready just put this side until it's nice and brown on the bottom you ready the server finish gripped in mind is take them off and I'm just gonna place them on a little bit take the tissue just to let them drain off so when you serve them up and the oily gonna like your serve them up now put it serve these up I've got some really nice crispy homemade fries that I've made you see you've got really nice coating there I can tell the crunchiness this is right look at it beautiful let me try quite really hot really lovely though it's a nice fluffy light coating you can't go wrong with this recipe and I served it up with some my crispy fries I've got a separate video for those so you know if you want to make really nice crispy fried have a look thanks for watching and enjoy
