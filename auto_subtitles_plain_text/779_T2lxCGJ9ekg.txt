 hey guys so continuing this month's theme of easy family meals I had to include something with a slow cooker I love a slow cooker especially if you don't have a lot of time to get dinner on the table they are such an ally in the kitchen so I'm going to show you one of my favorite things to make in a slow cooker crispy beef tacos let me show you how to make it so for this recipe I'm using a slow cooker from Cuisinart it's their three-in-one multicooker I really love this model because it comes with some pretty terrific features it actually does three different things you can brown and saute meat right in it so no need to take that insert over to the stovetop you can do it right in the slow cooker it will steam things for you so it comes with a little rack that you can put in the center and actually steam fish or vegetables and of course you can slow cook in it so hey three features for the price of one can't be beat now if you don't have a slow cooker you can actually also make this recipe in a regular stockpot and I'll leave you some instructions in the description on how to do that so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set the slow cooker to the brown and saute function at 400 degrees then we're going to put a little drizzle of olive oil in the pan and then we are going to brown 2 pounds of ground beef now this is really important because we do want to make sure that all of that meat is actually browned and cooked through first because when we go to slow cook it it actually is only reaching a 200 degree fahrenheit temperature so you do want to make sure that all of your meat is actually cooked through ahead of time now if you didn't want to use the beef you could also use ground chicken or ground turkey or if you wanted to make it vegetarian you could use kidney beans now as our meat is browning we're also going to add two teaspoons of salt and some freshly cracked pepper now this may look like a lot of salt at first but it is important to really salt your meat well especially as we're going to be adding lots of other ingredients into this dish and it's going to be simmering for several hours so we want to make sure that we are building up on that flavor and that these tacos become really tasty and once our meat is all browned we're going to add a cup of diced onion five garlic cloves 2 cans of diced tomatoes juice and all just throw it right in there 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and a cup of water go ahead and just kind of give that a stir and making sure that all of that is incorporated now we're going to add all the spices and my favorite spices for beef tacos are 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika 2 teaspoons of ground cumin 2 teaspoons of ground coriander and 4 teaspoons of dried oregano so go ahead and just mix that all up and you'll start to smell these delicious flavors start to come together and then all you are going to do is put the lid on and then you're going to press slow cook and the temperature that you want to keep this on is low and then you can go ahead and go about your day head off to work or school and when you come home you will be treated to the most delicious dinner over time what happens when you make this recipe and a slow cooker all of those juices and meat and vegetables and spices they all marry together and create the most delicious sauce and then the final step just before serving is to also add a teaspoon of white vinegar it'll just keep your tacos a little bit of a tang you won't really taste it like vinegar it'll just heighten all the flavors and then I also like to add about another teaspoon of dried oregano give it a stir and then it's ready to be brought to the table and here's the other thing why I like the slow cooker the cooking pot comes right out of the slow cooker and you can bring it to the table that way you can keep the lid on keep your meat warm why everybody serves themselves and the way that I like to eat these is take a store-bought taco shell fill it with some of the taco mixture top some cheddar cheese on top and some shredded iceberg lettuce and then I also like to serve it with a selection of hot sauces in varying temperatures depending on what everybody likes I love this recipe because it is so delicious you have that very flavorful beef and the sharpness of the cheese and the coolness of the lettuce it's such a great weeknight meal that actually did all the cooking while you were at work or school I hope you guys give this one a try and let me know what you think and for more great easy recipes be sure to subscribe and see you back here next week for a really fun in-person collab with one of my favorite youtubers Sara Lin from the domestic geek we'll see you then bye nothing new is easy you're amazing please take a bite of my it's piece of cake oh yes yes because it's you
