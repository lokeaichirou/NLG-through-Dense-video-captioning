 have leftover mashed potatoes from dinner turn them into breakfast favorite using this recipe for my crispy mashed potato pancake okay let's get started add two cups of cold mashed potatoes to a bowl be sure they're well-seasoned otherwise the pancakes will turn out a bit bland to the potatoes add two lightly beaten eggs 1 tbsp of flour and 1/8 TSP of garlic powder if your mashed potatoes are on the wet side add a bit more flour here we'll also add in 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and stir everything together okay ready to cook add one tablespoon of vegetable oil to a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat while the oil is heating up shape the mashed potatoes into one pancake the size of the skillet this is done quite easily using a lightly oiled dinner plate carefully slide the pancake onto the heated oil and lightly press the top with a spatula to flatten out evenly try making individual size pancakes if you wish cook the pancake covered until the bottom is crispy about ten minutes if you want to crisp up the top side as well slide the pancake back onto the oiled plate cover it with another plate and flip just like this then slide it back into the skillet and cook for another three to five minutes now we'll slide the pancake into a large platter and cut into wedges this is super easy if you have a pizza cutter on hands Allrecipes member dana says i am so glad i found an easier alternative to potato pancakes just one big pancake I served it with sour cream and chopped green onions delicious
