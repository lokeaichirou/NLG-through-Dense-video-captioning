 hi guys welcome back I've been away for a while but now i'm back and i will be making a quinoa tabouli today it's actually been requested by one of my subscribers who is a begin and I actually make this dish all the time it's one of my favorites and i thought i should share it with you guys so i hope you enjoy it okay let's get started the first thing we should do is cook the quinoa and let's come over and do it so we have a about a cup of water boiling Dara we can add about a couple pinches of salt and this is half a cup of quinoa just dump that in just come to a boil which is like about 30 seconds and then cover the pot and lower it and let it cook for about 15 minutes the key wash should already be ready let's shut up on it yeah like it's ready at this point we should pull off it with a fork and put some olive oil on it so they don't stick hey looks good the quinoa it has no flavor at all so what I like to do is flavor it with some dried mint this is a little bit of dry mint it adds a really good flavor to this mmm smell it already put some more this is definitely optional if you don't like men do you don't have to add this okay that's good I'm going to put it in the shallow dish so that it'll pull down and at any time chop up some means well it is cools down ok so we're going to put some parsley a little bit of cilantro some green onions a half of a cucumber tomatoes of course ok you want to finely chopped all these greens and everything in this this is a little bit of cilantro now we're gonna chop the green onions and the tomato this knife is so sharp and when you tap this you have to season the salad we're going to put olive oil salt and a half of a lemon and the other half of the lemon is going to go on top of this okay now we can pour this over the quinoa and let all the juices absorb into the quinoa and I like to put a lock on top just looks really good and it tastes good there you have it guys this was my version of a quinoa tabouli the best way to eat this is refrigerate this for about an hour and let all the juices soak into the quinoa or you can just eat it right away if you can't wait I hope you enjoy this video I will be posting a lot more videos so stay tuned
