 hi welcome to show me the CARICOM and Anuja and i middle and today we're making dal makhani dal makhni is a very popular Indian restaurant dish and unfortunately it's not very healthy for you but we're gonna offer you a very healthy and delicious recipe and here's what you need 1 cup whole or a dull quarter cup kidney beans 3 cups water 1/2 a medium onion chopped 1 TSP minced garlic 1 TSP minced ginger green chilli to taste salt to taste 1 tsp coriander powder red chilli powder to taste 1 TSP garam masala 1/2 tsp cumin powder 2 tablespoons yogurt well beaten 3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream 1 tbsp oil 1/2 tsp cumin seeds 1 medium tomato diced ia then actually washed and soaked our dal and the right amount together overnight and you're gonna put it in the pressure cooker now you want to use the water which you soak this in and that's all the flavor and we're gonna put in actually pretty much everything you're gonna go ahead and add in a garam masala at this point and our coriander powder cumin powder [Music] haldi turmeric powder that's it and chili powder and we also gonna put in the green chili now this is optional but it does give you a really nice flavor and you're gonna go ahead and add our onions and I'm some salts of course and the ginger garlic now traditionally actually so we're going to use the pressure cooker and we're gonna just cook everything together okay pressure is actually cut off and again everybody's pressure cooker so different so test yours and after you cooking it for a couple of times you can judge exactly how long it takes to cook these things but you know dolls they should be really soft tender and you definitely don't want to you know skimp on here whistles there comes to another I'm go ahead and our yogurt and cream I actually when we make it at home for ourselves for everyday use the only pitcher where we do not the cream but it does dissolve money if you're making me for a party or for a bigger group or something and just you know either go halves or just use cream whatever you prefer but one more thing I would mention is this is an excellent excellent recipe for the slow cooker you know you just put everything in put it in the morning it is a slow cooker it'll be done evening it works out very good it gives the wonderful flavor because it's slow-cooked and it takes its time and it's just wonderful in it let's go ahead and add it make sure you beat your cream and your yogurt before putting it I'm gonna put a little bit in and I'm gonna save a little bit just for garnishing at best and actually the yogurt gives a little you know sour taste which is just so good looks like very well and if you use a low-fat or fat-free yogurt it's you know saving a lot of calories there I think I'm just gonna let it boil for another five minutes meanwhile I'm gonna go ahead and get the seasoning ready and this is on low and at this point this is also a good time to adjust the water if you'd like to a little bit more gravy or a little bit more salt or anything like that it's a good time to fix all that right now if you have a little skillet for doing the seasoning we're gonna go ahead and put in the oil and in fact it's already hot so we're gonna go ahead and add in the Jeter just cumin seeds I keep switching see the cumin seeds have started sizzling we're gonna add in the tomatoes too much because we don't want them to get mushy we want them to retain their shape and tomatoes can always be in a drawer so I'm going to just add this and the big pieces look really pretty in it I'm gonna give it a mix looks awesome and it's ready to go so our doll is ready now at the time is serving we're gonna go ahead and just garnish with a little bit of cream on top and that's all you really need it or if you want you know if you pull a straw can afford it just a little kind of butter also you know it is bail money after all right so join us again on another episode of show me the CARICOM adding a pinch of sliced chili
