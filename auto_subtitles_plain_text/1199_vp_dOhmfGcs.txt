 hi Amy hi i'm chef tom i got a request from elizabeth one to learn how to make chicken pot pie so i got some rice noodle this is a dry very hard rice noodle and you soak into like hot water just from the tap hot water not boiling water if you soak in the warm water or the noodle see this they will stick together and later on it's hard to cook so you soak in this noodle with the ha warm hot water about i would say 15 minutes it was separating like this and this is for one serving and whom i like to do for one serving single serving you just get a nice serving plate and you just put a little bit the protein and the vegetable and the pasta here so you know that's just for you yeah I got some cook chicken oh you can use russet or a chicken or you can use the grilled chicken that you have leftover and I got some shredded cut carrot green onion this is the unsalted peanut and I use it food processor there's where you get this for garnish or later on I got some bean sprout in one egg so we're gonna make the sauce first I'm gonna show you how to cook now we are going to make the sauce pad thai sauce I got three tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and 2 tablespoon of sugar I just put it in the microwave for a few seconds and we stir until the sugar and vinegar dissolve like this give a quick taste this is going to be your sweet and balanced taste most people will add 3 tablespoon sugar and 3 tablespoon of the apple cider equal amount but I just add two tables with this summe so I like this way and about 1 TSP or the pre sauce and the Thai hot chili sauce maybe one tablespoon to even how you like it I like to use some hot chili flake and some sriracha get the more flavor and this is the one of the important ingredient for pad thai sauce tamari okay see it right here I got from kogure they have another one in Kroger or the Hellas market this is a like a fruit tastes like plum very sour get them a unique citrus so I'm gonna add in some two teaspoon here we go and you keep them a quick taste the sauce supposed to be look like almost like glaze and the sauce is pretty strong flavor mmm I like it nice well-balanced pad thai sauce and you have to respect to many different culture in Southeast Asia the regions everybody cooked your own pot a sauce so we have to respect them and this is my version of the pot pie sauce and that's like six seven way of the sauce the pot iced I can cook so I'm gonna introduce to you and now we're gonna cook we want to make sure the wok is hot some cooking oil this is good and we're going to cook the egg first and then we're gonna stir-fry the vegetables first as some ginger and garlic some of which stir-fry this is just for one serving for about a minute after one minute we're gonna end the noodles this Lulu is not well done cooked yet so we need some time to cook it through if you cook for like a few people at a time I suggest you cannot put a pot of the board in water and then you cannot add for the servings of the noodles into the power of the water just the boy for maybe you one minutes and they will soften really quick so we want to see that little bit covered up well maybe yeah 15-20 seconds and that will help to get the new loose often one quick note of if you cook for a lots of people like this wah I can cook for four serving if you cook for eight people I suggest you use to walk because you want to make sure you can maintain the temperature while you cook it very important you see the noodle is stopping now right and they still kind of stay dry if your ingredient that dry that's means your walk is not high not because you need to sear those Asian cooking is all about stir-fry and Sears so this is good now we're gonna add the sauce the sauce you add as much as you want and depends how you like it so I usually just think about cover up like a dressing the ideal actually needs to hold entire sauce and then like in the quick stir I bought if the city I think this is good now and the leftover sauce you can use it for later so now it's very critical a lot of people just surf like this so the sauce tastes like dressing sweet and sour watery which is not a really good full flavor yet you want to caramelize the sauce because we have sugar and all the two marine and all the good stuff so what I like to do is I want to keep stirring and make sure my wok is hot if they're not hot just cover up for a few seconds here we go you see the temperature increase and you almost want to stir the noodle until I did I kind of like a stick together again and I can see the chicken and the hate have the conversations as the flavor you just have to try a few time you know cook a few times you fire good recipe you just keep trying it until you master the way you like it oh yeah I can just tell by looking probably one more minute there with me oh yeah I like it hey before you serve keep them equipped right mm-hmm delicious so now if you want to have more flavor you just add a little more sauce at a time do the same thing it's going you don't burn the neuro it's fine just a little bit and let it stir fry it caramelize you heat the carmelization now texture voila so we can know for some bean sprout right here and some lime some people like to squeeze peace of mind and we're just gonna sprinkle some peanuts this is roasted unsalted peanut on the top like that and just it's the most Raksha let me get my parsley right here here we go I'm excuse me cilantro Elizabeth does your chicken pot pie I hope you liked the video I'm chef Tom thank you for watching bye
