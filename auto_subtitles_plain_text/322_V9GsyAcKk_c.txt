 along with the corned beef try making the recipe for Coke hannon let's dish host Chris kechi shows us how to make a traditional Irish side dish colcannon is an Irish side dish that's inexpensive to prepare because it brings together cabbage and potatoes to start it off we cut up the cabbage by cutting through the core of the cabbage in half and then cut it into quarters like so all we have to do is remove the tough core and then dice up the cabbage make a couple cuts turn it 90 degrees and then a couple more cuts and it's ready to cook we're going to take the cabbage and put it into a pot along with some diced-up peeled russet potatoes cover it with water bring it up to a boil and cook it until they're nice and tender when the potatoes and cabbage are done drain them and then in the same pot melt some butter toss in some diced onions when the onions are good and soft we're going to put some warm milk into the pot along with some green onions and then n goes that cabbage and potatoes that we cooked earlier and all we have to do at this point is just like you're making mashed potatoes we're going to smash this up and that cabbage and potatoes will soften into a puree at that point colcannon is ready to serve with your favorite meat or poultry whoo that looks good to you can look for that recipe on newsnet five or see the live well network on our digital subchannel 5.2 for more on chris ket key
