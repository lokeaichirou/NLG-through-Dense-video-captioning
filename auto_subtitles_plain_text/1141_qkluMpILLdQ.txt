 I discovered this a few years ago this is colcannon and it's a way to make sure that potatoes are about as elevated as you can make them super super easy this is a really old irish recipe that makes for my panther and is this companion is so what it means is white-headed cabbage and irish one of them and it's traditionally served on salad and i hope i'm pronouncing that right it's the day after Halloween if I'm not somebody tell me but it's really easy let me show you how you do it now back here I've got I'd say about two two and a half pounds of Irish potatoes and I'm just simmering them off over here I've got about half a pound of bacon and out of the pan that I did the bacon it i drained out all of the grease aha about two cups of shredded cabbage that's nothing right in here and I don't want to stir fry it or saute it actually want to barely steam it my time is about to go off so I'm putting a little bit of water what this is gonna do it's gonna get all the little make any stuff off the bottom without the grease and I don't want to let it go so long that it gets soggy I just want to get it a little bit tender so I'm gonna cover this up back here just to get hot cup of cream this is what no you know we you not only like Ireland for a reason you a backup of better now in Ireland and this is what best thing when they serve this they serve family-style and they could have a bill and they put a hole in the center of the potatoes and they fill that with Nutter Butter and the whole deal is that you're supposed to take a fork full of potatoes and dip it melted butter yeah that's a good start okay now my potatoes are almost done I've got my cabbage sitting here gonna steam for probably five or six minutes potatoes are good and I'm letting the cream and the butter get warm and kind of come together I'm gonna drain these off and come right back and I'll show you how super-easy this is really good all right Suman steamed off my potatoes and then when I put them back into the warm pot put them back into the hot pot because it helps dry them off I care I'm in the cream and the butter that I have melted back here I have the cabbage right here that I've given just a few minutes I'm still want some texture and some crunch to it when I crunch the bites I guess so that is coming right over here into the pot yeah I like to do the green onions that go in here these are tiny they got very mild flavor so I don't want to cook them if you want to if you want a softer flavor go ahead and throw them in the pot with the cabbage for the last couple of minutes and then right in there and if you've added the cream of the butter and it's a little too dry say about some of the potato cooking water and use that but then if you do that watch the salt because the weed little too salty careful black pepper okay so all I'm doing it's gonna mash this up transfer it over there and get ready to show you what will probably be your new favorite temperature all right you go ahead and said the whole family's the whole thing well unfortunately I'm here all by myself there we go you got a love I think this defines it a little bit of green onion the cabbage a little bit baking and right into the melted butter I can move to Ireland you
