 hello everyone mark here welcome to a thousand simple recipes today we're going to do the Asian sandwich the spring roll now the spring rolls famous all over Asia is a fantastic fast food you can either make them cooked or uncooked and today I'm going to do the cook version with chicken and vegetables so let's go for it as always guys we've got the ingredient list and the recipe written below in the description box the great thing about this method of making a spring roll is that the sauce is basically inside this spring roll so on what I'm going to do is just make the sauce that's going to go into the chicken and vegetable mix inside so we've got 1 tablespoon of Mira Nair we've got the tablespoon of soy we've got a tablespoon of sugar we're going to put about half a tablespoon of sesame oil some chicken broth 4 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon of corn flour so that's what it looks like when it's finished so here we are cooking the filling I've just got a couple of tablespoons of peanut oil in there I'm just going to fly that ginger up to start with on a hot pan and I've got some chicken which we finely chop the one breath and that will see fry that for about you know 20 seconds so is it just keep that movie once that starting to move don't want to fry it for too long I just want a little bit of color off it and now I'm going to add my vegetable so that without enough add the carrot the capsicum and relaxing and is it fly that up you just want to get this just like a jack for a little business just starting to look like the chicken's gone right now so we'll just get the rotten now the sauce that we made up earlier and that should thicken up the sauce nicely you just want to wait until the vegetables and and the sauce starts to thicken up as you can see now the sauce in there is just starting to get a bit of thickness to it so here I'm just peeling off the wrappers and you just want to do as many as you're going to make and keep them in a damp tea cloth because you don't want to let them dry out otherwise they crack and become hard to roll so I'm going to do about 12 here so that's it so the chicken and vegetable mixture is cooled down and so I'm just going to add some rice vermicelli that I've just soaked in water for about 40 minutes and then put straight into some hot water for about 15-20 seconds in that soil until they become tender and then chopped it into three or four inch pieces and I'm just going to add that coriander to now and we just this is pretty much our filling now once we finish this with me start wrapping okay so this is our finished mix I'm just going to check that for saltiness and just taste it and just needs a little bit more salt so I'm just going to put a bit of salt in there so here we are we just got the pastry of diagonally facing towards us one of the secrets of making spin grousers not to overfill them just so don't try and put too much in and what you want to do is roll that one over first and then when you get to the halfway mark you roll that over and that one over and then I'm using some egg white here but you could use flour and water or work just as well to close up your spring roll we want to keep as tight as possible try and keep any air bubbles out and now we have this ready to cook so we're just going to add a couple of spring rolls at a time you want to overfill your and you want to just keep turning the over so they cook evenly and these you want to cook for about six or seven minutes the oil temperature you don't want to have it too hot you want to you want it to cook gradually so you get really crispy outside skin just going to take these spring rolls out now they look absolutely gorgeous beautiful golden brown color and let them drain that excess oil off so this is the chicken and vegetable spring roll it's more of a japanese chinese style of spring roll but it's delicious crunchy on the outside mmm chicken and noodles and vegetables it's delicious if you really want the healthy version look at my other uncooked rice paper spring roll for the gluten free and people and still issues too but really that's Fanta I'm going to enjoy a whole all of these overall ball days I'm going to sit down and 18 now so i'll see you next time on a thousand simple recipes
