 this week's feast Naruto ramen what else to say about this dish other than that it is the ramen that Naruto loves to consume but hold on we're not just making any packaged noodles this is a feast of fiction we're doing it legit so we're gonna make our soup stock out of pork put the leftover bones and meat in a pot fill it up with water crush some ginger and put on the heat scoop off the scum because that's disgusting well if you like it then you should have put a lid on it after it's boiled for a couple of hours take out your bones and then stick the whole thing in the fridge this way when it's frozen the fat has coagulated to the top and you can scoop it off and I just heat your soup back up next using some Yoshida's sauce and Lee Kum Kee chicken marinade we're gonna make some delicious pork now the best pork you can select will both be lean and still have fat on it fill up a pot with your sauces and then just dip the pork inside and turn that heat on flip it around a couple of times and wait till it gets to a boil then lower it and reduce it to a simmer Asian cooking pro tip if you want to make sure that your pot doesn't boil over try sticking a toothpick in between the pot lid and the pot now after that's been cooked take out your meat and prepare some hard-boiled eggs because this part is pretty fun we're gonna try to blow out hard-boiled eggs the wages you crack a little hole in the top and on the bottom [Music] then just soaked it back into the same liquid that you put your fork in now it's time for handmade noodles we got cake flour flour baking soda and salt to mix them together and add a little water of course you can't use a KitchenAid for 12 minutes or your ninja skills okay boy no jutsu all right back to the mixer now we're playing in this in slo-mo so you can see what the dough should look like once it's ready it'll stick to the paddle after that add a little bit of oil this will make the dough first split apart but after a couple of seconds it should attach right back to the paddle now you're ready to go yes turns out that hand spinning your own noodles is actually extremely difficult and would take many years to master and there's us messing up so we suggest if you want a hand make your own noodles go back to the Legend of Korra episode and look how we did the Water Tribe noodles you can actually use the same recipe we use here just roll it flat and follow the same instructions but if you really want a hand pull your own noodles we put some links in the more info box below that have some great tutorials on how to do it yourself all you need is a little bit of patience and a lot of practice it's very difficult so good luck the rest of the ingredient prep is simple cut up some cilantro and green onions cook some spinach in some boiling water squeeze it out and then cut it up to size take your eggs out and cut them in half then slice the iconic Naruto Maki cover your noodles with some broth and carefully place the ingredients all around remember presentation is key here sprinkle it all on at the end and voila you've got Naruto ramen we like to call this a faithful recreation of authentic Japanese ramen now there are many different ways to make authentic broth for ramen and this is just our own recipe we encourage you to actually go on YouTube and look up some more there are plenty out there Happy New Year and congratulations you've made Naruto ramen or ramen [Music] it's tasty but operated American to make a lot good job mom stop gimme I didn't do very much [Applause] [Music]
