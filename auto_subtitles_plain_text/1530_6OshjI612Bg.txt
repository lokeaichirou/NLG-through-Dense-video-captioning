 and why is this not an ordinary tomato soup well it's not worry for a number of reasons first we're going to use a canned sauce tomato the plum tomatoes they're ripe they're meaty and saunas San marzanos are great one trick I learned from a wonderful Italian cookbook was really pulling out that pithy center which is tough and eliminate some of the water in this way we just lay it down and we roast these two even dehydrate them more so all of these and what do you do with that juice it comes save that juice for the soup it's such a simple I thought you're gonna say save it for the Bloody Marys well we do that as well and so you know it becomes a real evaluation of the tomato makes a great soup okay so that's good so these get dried in the oven just dry them in the items elzar with some olive oil olive oil and salt and then they throw them in at 350 for about 10 minutes you can go really hard on it and add a lot of caramelize ation tomato soup we just want to pull the moisture out fleur de sel fleur de sel is the best is it you know what I like to do I like to roast these and just eat them on toast I love what I use like that oh I'm good okay so that goes in the oven so right into the oven and then it's all about now starting to sweat the vegetables to create that flavor base we have our onions right here we have our butter which is melted or homemade butter which is wonderful Vidalia onions are in season right now we just lay those in and this is a crucial step that a lot of people I think forget which is really break those tomatoes down that's it yeah yeah there we go so that it's not about ten minutes it's about sweating and letting this onion become a new thing a lot of the flavor is gonna happen right here right all right so you see the dehydrated tomatoes yeah once this goes down we're gonna throw in a little fresh bay leaf and look how bright and fresh thyme fresh thyme a little smashed garlic cuz we want that to get flavored in there so this is the base of a marinara the base of tomato so cook this and cook this is cook and cook until we're ready to go alright alright thank you and so you see it's all nice and melted yes and then we're gonna just go in with our Tomatoes if you want to slide a hold these okay good have a partner in the kitchen hmm so beautiful so how many seats is your restaurant have 55 so it's pretty intimate nice size though oh yeah and you know it's dinner only seven dollars cooking tonight I've got a great you're here well you know everything's about team and I want all that oil to leave out all that flame all tomato infused oil rubber spatulas are essential and then we let that stew around then we're gonna pour the tomato juice in and we're gonna touch it from one can that's from I think we're two can okay a little cayenne pepper in there we're gonna put a pinch more of fleur de sel I like cooking with fleur de sel because it's not high in salinity I think there's a lot of your mommy in there it's just a great season rattle oh tomatoes in Florida cellars ones already looks good and then uh-oh do Mantic I have chicken stock or water or a little extra tomato juice on the side to evaluate the consistency a lot is about how much are you gonna reduce the soup okay I have the food mill cuz I like that course or a structure and I don't want to whip a lot of air in there that's how we're gonna bring that until we get our soup to make a little splatter let's say it's uh already I was my favorite job in the kitchen was putting all the tomatoes through the food milk made that great big one oh the other bands are nice it's just different than just going straight to a blender and see it's calmer so you have a gastro tub also so your home and Finch is really a celebration of whole meat cookery till 2:00 in the morning I felt that uh eating carbonara after midnight it makes your life better no way yes so I thank you and so we just keep bringing that in so we get all those juices and all that pulp off and you don't want to waste any earlier look at that and always rate the bottom of your food mill everybody yes that's probably the best part right there so good and then we really have our soup which is just icy cream here you're gonna add cream shorter or not we're gonna add a little cream and so you have this nice sauce is this from the same cows yeah it's all Johnson how much the whole thing uh I think that's good it's good okay so there's our soup right there delicious I know it's so simple yeah taste a little bit of that soup mmm very good you
