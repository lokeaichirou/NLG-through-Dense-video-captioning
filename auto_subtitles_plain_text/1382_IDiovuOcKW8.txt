 cooking news plans vegan easy hi everyone its anya from cooking with plants and today on making a no oil added hornets this is great for a snack whenever you're hungry great for breakfast lunch or dinner and great for your kids and for lunches so let's get started the main ingredients that i use as a base for localness is a tin of chick peas and a tin of cannellini beans or butter beans or any other white theme that you may have on hand I do sometimes cook the beans from scratch as well but just for a quick easy homeless recipe I like to use the tinned and I also use some of the liquid from the tin so these are organic and they are in water and some salt so I won't be adding too much extra salt sometimes I don't add any extra salt at all just depending on who I'm cooking for on the day and what the purpose is for the homeless so I'll start by just drain leads very quickly so just get the juice out of it chickpeas just roughly drain them there will be some chickpeas leftover I'm using a food processor today it just takes less liquid to actually make them but I do quite often make it in the blender as well you'll just need to add more liquid till you get the right consistency even though the tin of peas so next I'm going to do the same thing as I just did with the chickpeas but with the cannellini beans again roughly draining them while I remember I'm also going to take out just a few of these chickpeas for decorating the UM almost at the end when I put them into a bowl too also I'll just leave those there in a little on a little plate for later and I'll add in the cannellini beans so each of these tins has four hundred and twenty-five grams so if you if you're cooking these from scratch maybe about a cup and a half to two cups and then you can just gauge the moisture level and add more moisture to the mixture as you need it next I'm adding in two very large cloves of garlic it's up to you how much garlic you want to use sometimes we use up to six cloves of garlic so my husband likes to be very heavy-handed with his garlic today I'm just using two large cloves probably equivalent to about four small or for regular sights cloves those in okay next I'm adding the juice of one lemon you can add the juice of two if you like a lemony taste just adjust the taste as you go as to your preference next I'm adding two tablespoons of tahini which is just ground up sesame paste there's no added oil in this paste at all it's just 100% ground-up sesame seeds this is really good for iron a little bit of extra iron and the lemon juice in this will also help with the absorption of the iron so love your hummus next I'm adding in 1 teaspoon of ground-up cumin seeds but you can also use the whole seat if you like they're nice and add a little bit of a nice texture in there too but today I earning the ground version as I mentioned earlier we are going to be adding some of the salty liquid from the beans and the chickpeas but you can add salt and pepper to taste and I am going to add a little bit of Celtic sea salt today and some white pepper I just like the way the white pepper brings out the flavors so I've got about 1 teaspoon of Celtic sea salt and about quarter of a teaspoon of the white pepper now as I mentioned earlier when I'm making hummus depending on if I'm making it in the food processor or in my blender the liquid that's used will vary because you don't need as much liquid when using a food processor so just to start with I'm going to put probably about well--that's quarter of a cup and a little bit more that's about half a cup there to start with and I'll just start that blending process and just see what texture will be like and if I need to adjust it I'll do so at that time so that's been processing for about half a minute and that is quite a run consistency I probably could have even used a little bit less liquid I'm just so used to making it in my blender instead of here that it's ended up a bit more runny so maybe start with quarter of a cup of the mixture give it a taste if mmm Oh YUM Oh I've actually got my son home today so I'm going to call him in in a minute to taste this and give you some feedback on how good this is yeah okay so I've got my son Josh with me here and he loves his hummus so I'm just serving him out some and I'm gonna take fire getting to do we get him to do a taste test for you there we go making me hungry how's that taste awesome if you rabbit and homemade Homer in such a long time so we're just having these with some little rice crackers brown rice crackers with a little bit of tomato seaweed those and that's just a really easy combination it's also great with some carrot sticks or some bell peppers dipped into it anything you like really these are just fantastic so
