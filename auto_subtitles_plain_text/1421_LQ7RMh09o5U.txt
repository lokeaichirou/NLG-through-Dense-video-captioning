 I am NOT looking in this particular episode i have my workout clothes on because i'm going to need it after eating beef Jason my husband is actually going to make his grandmother's recipe for pierogies she was Ukrainian so grandmother is baba Baba okay grandfather GG okay and they actually didn't call him Brody's they call them put a hat what half set which I don't know if that's accurate thank you korean or not but that's what they call that was what I think all right so you've already started this process and the first part of it has to do with the peeling potatoes right yep it's all potatoes and she just caught him in the chunks about ok bite-sized I guess something more than that just so that when you put him in the dough they they fit in a secret to my grandfather's recipe was the dough huh how he made the dough okay so you've got to tell us and show us how am I headed you three cups of flour and then and there's it's not so and then you'll have a teaspoon of salt regular salt salt and then a quarter cup of oil vegetable oil works we use half hour oil but you wanna you want to just pour it in there easy to own a big huge clump I found just experimenting that I use this mixer and started out slow because if you don't you can have like a white cloud everything will be dusty all around the show because this is how my grandfather was they literally sit there with a bowl and go like this until all this all that oil was like it was smooth odd how much water and does it matter if it's cold or hot it my mom always said one cup of cold water up or most of it in there just leave a little bit and then the nasty part it's getting making the dough big ball is a good idea you see I didn't put all the water in there so it's not all pumping together yet and then when I see I'm close I put the rest in at this stage you're going to put it in a bowl and let it sit and rest for about 45 minutes I guess I always cover it just to keep stuff from getting in it and that but it'll sit there and rest for about 45 minutes to an hour before you're ready to start rolling it up you move okay once you take them out of the freezer there they're frozen I just played a little thing and loosens them all up but they'll be like card and then I just put them in these are big ziplock baggies but nobody should be good they won't now that the frozen I won't stick together and you can file them all in there and then you can pull out as many as you need and then put them right back in the freezer and they won't stick you know that all you can have to being in the freezer they won't stick and then when you go to cook them we all know how many we can eat Killian will eat half a dozen and I usually eat more Pacific boiling water here and we're just going to add them to the wall and you like these right who doesn't like cheese and potatoes all right and then what are you dipping it in score free how is it really good and they're good with what else gravy everything's great enjoy you
