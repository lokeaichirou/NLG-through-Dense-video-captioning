 hey everyone chef Jason Hill here and today I'm going to prepare a traditional Eggs Benedict with homemade hollandaise sauce and Canadian bacon let's get started first thing we're gonna do is make up the hollandaise sauce first we need to melt down nine tablespoons of butter I'm gonna put my little sauce pot on a low heat because we don't want to burn the butter I just want it to melt if you break your butter up into little chips and it tends to melt a little faster okay we're just about there if you want you can remove the froth from the top by skimming it with a spoon but it's not necessary so we're gonna take three large eggs we need the egg yolk right I could open this is the messiest part of the job there we go there's one yoke and don't throw out your egg whites you can use this and make a healthy omelet now we're just gonna add everything to the blender except the butter three egg yolks eight teaspoon of cayenne pepper this really doesn't give it any heat it just pops the flavors out 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt or sea salt and then a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice I'll put my lid back on leaving the vent hole open drizzle in our butter power on the machine how cool this display is we're gonna start on number one if that gets going and slowly drizzling the butter from the top and that's it but ER remove the lid oh my gosh perfect absolutely perfect hollandaise sauce now it's time to poach the eggs okay I got a slow boil going on here you don't want it to be a rapid boil or your egg will break apart if you don't have really fresh eggs to help the egg coagulate as its cooking add 2 teaspoons of vinegar and I have a quart of water here and I'm gonna throw in a pinch of salt and we're gonna start stirring this to form a little whirlpool and this will also help keep the egg intact okay it's been under just about two minutes on low I'm gonna scrape away some of the egg white it's still what the a go to be runny so take your slotted spoon and carefully remove your poached egg for that little perfect poached egg there um after we poach the eggs let's go ahead and toast your English muffin get our pan nice and hot a little cooking spray I'm just gonna keep those up but only take us a thirty seconds so our sauce is done the eggs are poached the muffins are toasted Canadian bacon is sizzling away I think we're good all right let's build our Eggs Benedict get our Canadian bacon on there followed by our poached eggs our wonderful homemade hollandaise and for garnish let's put a little bit of fresh chives from the garden oh boy pretty amazing how something so elegant can be done so easy give this recipe a try you won't be disappointed this is one of my favorite things to eat thanks for tubing in outstanding
