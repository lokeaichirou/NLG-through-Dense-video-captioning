 hi its Christie in the radio kitchen today I'm going to make the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich it uses three different types of cheese and I'm getting this out of our cream cheese cookbook so I can guess one of the ingredients is cream cheese and it's super easy to make but super delicious so let's get started so you need about ten slices of an Italian bread and you can buy it sliced I just like to buy it in slice and I can cut it to the size I like and if you could tell this rate of serrated bread knife makes it really easy to cut that bread now some people don't like as much bread so it'll easily cut a thin slice it will easily cut a thick slice and this nice sharp knife prevents you from smashing down you get a nice rounded bread slice with those sharp serrated teeth now we're going to set this aside because I want to show you how to mix up the cheese filling so in a bowl you're going to take a three ounce package of cream cheese 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise a cup of shredded cheddar cheese a cup of shredded mozzarella and a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and about 1/4 teaspoon of seasoned salt and this is new to radio cutlery we have a burger and fry seasoning we have a barbecue seasoning we have some marinades they're all really tasty and good all right we're just going to mix this together it's going to get kind of pasty which is as good I hear until you don't be turned off by the mayonnaise because that's what kind of holds it all together and it gives it a rich flavor put that cream cheese and mozzarella and cheddar they're all going to melt together so on five slices we're going to spread this mixture it's really easy to spread with this little party spreader spreads butter and jam it's really great to put out on your appetizer table or cheese balls I like to put the slices out so you know that you can easily share the cheese alright now I'm going to go in and tap these with our remaining slices and we're going to go over to our skillet and prime up so now we're going to take about two tablespoons of butter and put that on this skillet and I'll add our I'm just going to make a cup over now I like to cook that on medium medium high but you want to watch them once they start browning they're going to go fast so once your sandwiches are brown on both sides and ready to serve the cheese is all melted they're ready to serve this is our shorter bread slicer for muffins and smaller breads like this and that's the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich one of the recipes in our 101 recipes with cream cheese enjoy you
