 Louis peppered of lilliput loaf company in Mullingar County Westmeath told us about the traditional Irish potato cake box-t and he shows us here how to make it using fresh local ingredients Cavan and eaten they tend to mix mashed potatoes in and they make boxty loaf and they make boxy dumplings and yeah but I'm going to do that additional West of Ireland boxes which is common in Connemara and mayo and paste that out so you get about three or four nice nice potatoes I need the skin on because there's a nice color on the skin and the skin of the potato is nearly better for you than the actual center of the potato so from there we wrap it up and then you squeeze it sometimes it goes all over the place so you just squeeze out the starch it's thrown in so today I'm going to do a Irish flag box stick and which is really it's going to add in a little bit a sweet potato well I I tend I think I've tried different potatoes and I tend to use the the Roosters I just like it's a habit I suppose you want a fairly hard potato not too much moisture in it and a fairly new fresh potato and so this is a bit of saccade Irish flag box tea what I'm doing is putting a little bit of the orange of their sweet potato in now I actually invented this here about six weeks ago I do the market here every Saturday morning so salt is another ingredient now I I tend to use carry on door see there somewhere that's tend to mix the salt with you know grinders with herbs gives a little beautiful flavor the other thing which is very nice in this particular box is a bit of fennel I love fennel a really nice herb and people are sort of put off it because of them they put off because of the aniseed flavor which it goes very well in any dish as a flavoring it's also nice and green and these are Westmead scallions not need scallions now the West needs guidance and they've also got a nice green on them as well and that the organic locally produced organic scallions are absolutely delicious there's nothing like what you buy in the supermarket you can see they're nice and the real scallions nice and small love plenty of green on them and this is this is a one of Sheridan's cheese's now we're just going to go really well with this particular box tea and its say it's a rye field cheese which is a goat's cheese and it's nice and crumbly I'm gonna stick my fingers into it and just add a little bit at often where's that from that's seemingly was produced from two fields down from here originally so it's nice to use I love using local ingredients that's what the markets are all about then we add in a little bit of flour about to two to four tablespoons of flour that's nice to get my hands nice and flour yeah that's just binds it and I put in a little bit of buttermilk as well it just you're making a nice paste with it and it keeps it all together in the pan so I just put a small little buttermilk in now maybe if we were doing this with the mashed potatoes we wouldn't need a bottle milk but it just helps to bind us so that's really yes no that's the mix made well the only way I've ever been able to cook us and they tried cooking as an oil after my cooking and asura thinks is with her hush cast-iron pan and I'm sitting the pan but not burning and then me oh yeah they put the Knicks into their water then it is like the Irish flag isn't it now it's green white and orange anyway so I know everything in that and I was from the Midlands after about seven minutes each side on the pan the box-t is ready to be served ah stop I think many people lived a second one here you
