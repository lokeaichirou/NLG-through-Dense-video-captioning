 first thing we're going to do is cook some bacon I have six strips in here which I cut into slight pieces as you can see I'm just going to cook this until it's all cooked okay we're going to use two ten ounce cans of plan for this I'm using baby clams and what I did is I just as you can see drain them but I'm going to keep the liquid that's 283 grams by the way if you're using bigger clams you're gonna have to chop them or you can just buy minced clams for this you know chopped clams I'm also going to use clam juice for this this is an 8 ounce bottle that's 236 milliliters if you cannot find this you can use a cup of chicken stock alright we're going to take the bacon out of the pot now that it's nice and crisp I will keep the fat in there I'm going to add some chopped onion to this and a celery we're going to cook this for a few minutes until the onions are softened and translucent I'm going to be using baby potatoes for this recipe all I did is scrub them I will not peel them and I quartered them you can use russet potato peel it and just chop it into pieces I'm going to add some thyme leaves to this let's call it a teaspoon now I'm going to add 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour couple grams on the recipe for you we're going to cook this for a couple minutes now we're going to add our liquid the liquid from the cans and the clam juice you know the clam juice is salty and the liquid from McCann also has some salt to it so I'm not going to add any salt until the end we'll taste it and then decide if it needs more so you have roughly two and a half cups of liquid and I'm going to whisk it in and get rid of all the lumps that might form you know all the flour lumps that might form there's no flour lumps in here this is perfect I'm not gonna add my potatoes and most of the bacon I'll leave some for topping so leave that for toppings all right we're going to let this simmer for about 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender don't let this start boiling crazy okay make sure it's just simmering I want you to stir this occasionally okay these potatoes are cooked they're nice and tender I can pierce them with a fork that took about I'm going to say maybe 20 minutes I'm going to add one and a half cups of cream to this and I'm going to add the clams so we're just going to mix all this we're going to simply heat this through I'm not going to let this boil and that taste for salt for me it's fine I will add pepper as you can see I garnish this with some bacon and now we are going to eat dinner yes this is one of my favorite soups it's not health food so I don't eat it maybe once a year but boy is it good this is very very very nice you're super easy to make elegant enough to have for when you have guests over it's also a great little weeknight dinner by the way this bread is made by my friend Mercedes here and she's going to be making a video with us in a few weeks so that I can show you how to make this we're gonna make these into little rolls delicious thank you for watching this video I appreciate it a lot if you liked it and you like thank you if you share it with your friends and you serve and you comment thank you thank you thank you I really really appreciate it you have no idea how much I appreciate your support a lot thank you I will have this recipe on the website ready for you guys to come and print it in the meantime eat well that going broke I'm going to see you guys soon
