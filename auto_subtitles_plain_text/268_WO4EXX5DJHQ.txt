 I'm making beef Burgundy that's a little dressed up not complicated just with a few special touches that really have a great payoff in the flavor so I brown some bacon very quickly over high heat and I also need some drippings to brown the beef cubes in and rather than adding an oil from a bottle I just decided let's use bacon drippings that is so much more flavorful I'm going to toss the beef cubes with some flour because I want to get a nice firm finish on the browned beef and once you can see that it is all well covered then add about half of the cubes at a time yes you might be tempted to speed it up and do it all at once but if you crowd the skillet the beef will steam in its own juices because it doesn't have enough individual contact with the heat of the pan and it doesn't have enough space around it to actually allow the browning to occur so we've got a nice Brown finish on these guys and they will be the first batch of finished beef cubes in they go and now time for the second batch which has been nicely patiently waiting here pour them into the pan so we've got the kind of brown finish on these cubes the second batch that I've been looking for and it's time to put them into the slow cooker as well jump in there and you know what it would break my heart to leave this beautiful brown drippings behind we're going to add some red burgundy wine and add it to this pan and you can see how it will deglaze those gorgeous drippings that have collected this will add immeasurably to the flavor of the finish but before I add the wine I'm going to add the seasonings so seasoning salt plain salt some beef bouillon because I do want to have a rich beef flavor and a good swirl of pepper garlic of course doesn't hurt a thing some dried oregano some dried thyme and then the rest of the red wine that I didn't add to the pan and finally these great drippings just going to go in here and really make this dish sing and then the bacon that we crisped earlier so now we've added all of the flavorings including the crispy bacon and I'm going to set it in the slow cooker where it will cook on low for four hours so let's see how things are going here ah ah you could get drunk on that flavor it is so amazing we have one thing to do yet and that is adding ketchup and you may ask why now well I'm doing it because I didn't want the tomatoey flavor to be lost in this long simmering stew so I'm going to keep the intensity of the tomato flavor by adding it near the end and the fresh mushrooms go in as well I love the fresh taste of mushrooms and I wanted to be able to maintain that and they simply don't need to cook as long as the beef does so here we go stir them in the lid goes back on and that only needs to heat for another ten to fifteen minutes just enough time for me to make noodles I am going to have noodles with beef Burgundy on top for dinner tonight so let's see how things have progressed here it is exactly the consistency I wanted it's nice and thick this is a birthday where the meal and I say that because our son-in-law routinely asks for beef Burgundy for his birthday dinner whenever I am cooking for him and ask him what he would like how can you beat this but really I ought to test it to make sure mmm worth every extra effort related to the bacon the brown bits and the late edition of the ketchup and the mushrooms which is great food
