 hey internets so like in last Monday's meal Monday video where I shared with you three healthy breakfast recipe today's lighting is equally awful because instead of being early in the morning it's late at night I'm wall blade ish because now it gets dark up basically 4:00 p.m. which is really sad in this kind of weather one of my favorite recipes to make is minestrone because it is such a good way to have every color of the rainbow in vegetables all in one delicious warming soup and I wanted to share with you my recipe for it because I think it is such a great warming dinner also makes an amazing easy lunch that I never get tired of which is so important if you're going to be eating something repeatedly throughout the week because you made a huge batch so that's exactly what I'm going to show you how to do tonight we're gonna make minestrone together so if you'd like to know how to make that delicious healthy soup then keep watching so to make my version of minestrone you will need the following ingredients from left to right four or five large carrots a couple of parsnips four cloves of garlic a couple of stalks of celery I'm using three a large bunch of kale a box of pasta you're only going to need about half of the box if you're making a very large batch of soup that is still plenty and using cut macaroni although traditional you would actually be snipped aleni I just don't have any on hand then you'll need a wedge of parmesan including the rind a large onions with crushed tomatoes beans of your choice I'm using kidney and pinto then you'll need some stock and some red chili flakes if you like a little spice to your life as well as the obvious salt and pepper the spices I like to use in my minestrone or turmeric which is really great for you it's a great anti-inflammatory paprika which adds a really nice little smoky hint some time I don't have any fresh thyme using dried and some fresh rosemary from my balcony alright so as I hope you guys can hear from that circling sound I frying up my aromatic festival so that's my summary my carrots onions garlic and also the percent since I have it might as well stir-fry it with the rest the only tip that I would give you guys is for the kale and any other sort of OTC goodies that you might add to your minestrone do not add it now I do not even a degree of your beans or tomatoes or your broth which I'm just gonna show you all those substances fry it up and softened up a little bit but you don't want add the greens until the last minute because otherwise if you leave all of this flavor and color and cut some ground and grow it horrible you really just want to will quickly leave in the soup gonna be about ten minutes so I'll show you guys that step when we get to it to my fried vegetable mixture I'm going to add my crushed tomatoes and I'm making a mess on my spoon because I am looking at this through a viewfinder beauty guru problems you guys will not have this problem when you are making this I promise I'm also gonna rinse off the can of tomato with water after but I don't have a hand to do that because I'm holding the camera then I'm gonna add my first can of beans which I have rinsed really really well you definitely want to make sure that you do that I'm going to dump my generous parmesan rind in there and make sure you fish that out at the end I like to nibble on it because I'm strange like that and it's delicious and then I'm going to add to this mixture simultaneously rinsing off my spoon I know I'm so smart about 10 cups of liquid or until you feel like it's perfect for you depends how much liquid you want in your bra and how thick you want it if you want it more of like a soupy kind of consistency or more of a stew alike consistence my soup has simmered for about two hours which is a really good amount you can do a little bit less or a little bit more a lot depends on how tender you would like your carrots and I've washed and torn up my kale and removed all of the stems the middle parts because that's really tough and you don't want that in your soup or any really for the most part you can see this looks like a lot but it's really going to wilt down into the soup and plus is good for you I would struggle to eat this much kale if it wasn't all wilted and in a soup so I mean at that and I actually just like to add my pasta at the same time so I have my elbow pasta right here and I'm gonna add about half of the box so I guess that's about 250 grams into the soup and it'll just absorb all the delicious flavors as its cooking and then I'll show you guys my bowl and once it's ready so there is the finished product I think it looks pretty yummy you guys can see the steam rising off of it dramatically I really enjoyed sharing this recipe with you it's one of my favorite staples for an easy falling winter dinner or lunch and it travels to the office really really well and it's just so warming and comforting and full of a lot of different veggies which is great for you you so much for coming to hang out with me in the kitchen today for my meal Monday series and I will see you guys in my next video bye
