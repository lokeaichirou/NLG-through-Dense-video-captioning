 I'm gonna start over again oh my god hey guys welcome to my tiny kitchen today I'm going to show you how I cook in my small dry kitchen which is a kitchen without running water we're going to be making egg fried rice with pork two cups of water boiling in our pan we have two cups white rice I already rinsed this four eggs some canola oil some soy sauce chicken fat fresh onions that I just cut from my garden now I only have one clove of garlic on me right now so that's what I'm going to be working with but I would use for if you have it at home we got some water boiling here and I put two cups of tree rings white rice as well as two tablespoons of vegetable oil in there so while the rice is cooking i'm going to show you guys how I easily cut garlic and the only thing you need is a chef's knife and a pair of clean scissors I just chop the bottom off take the side of my knife and I'm going to press into it take the skin off and now I have a piece of garlic as you can see it's already kind of it's all like separated I'm just going to put that over my frying pan and I'm going to cut that about five times probably the worst part of living in a dry cabin is doing dishes so I've learned a lot of easy tricks to avoid making as many dishes as possible this saves you dishes it saves you time I take my clean scissors and I start cutting the pork into strips because I was bone in and we're just going to cut around the bones so after you cut the pork into strips you're going to cut it into cubes now that we have our pork cut we're just going to put two tablespoons of canola oil in with our garlic and we're going to let that start frying once that guard looks nice and aromatic you're going to take your pork and add that in let's just dump that on in there we're going to add some pepper as you can see the pork is now cooked our eggs cracked and put in the bowl packed and put in the bowl you're going to gently mix these together just to combine the yolk with the whites but not enough to a dare you don't want to make this like fluffy scrambled eggs about two tablespoons of soy sauce into their the nice helping of pepper pour the contents of your eggs into the pan once you start seeing that the bottom of your eggs has began cooking I'm going to turn that heat back down a bit you're going to start rolling your pan so just rolling it like so so yeah just make sure all the edges pop up like that it's just like a big egg pancake are you very gently going to score your eggs the way I was taught is you make your eyes a day ahead I don't do that so that's that so with all the main components cooked and ready to go we're going to heat up our pan add a bit of canola oil wash my scissors after I cut the pork and now i'm going to just cut my green onions into this canola oil i'm going to just put my rise in there add my chicken tender chicken fat and i'm going to ask boys off i would start with about two days to just get to mixing now add some pepper unfortunately while i was frying the rice the camera stopped recording uh-oh I don't even know how to explain it oh so the last two steps you add the eggs and the pork and cook for another 5 minutes from my tiny kitchen to yours Bon Appetit
