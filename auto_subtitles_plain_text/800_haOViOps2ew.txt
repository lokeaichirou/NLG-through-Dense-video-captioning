 assalam alaikum and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan Hungarian Goulash has nothing to do with ghouls and ghosts but it is a rather delicious dish from Hungary for those people who are hungry for my goulash I've got 450 grams of lamb cut into cubes now if I was being ultra authentic I'd actually be using beef but I've only got lime in the freezer so lamb it is there's one small onion chopped 1 tomato peeled and cut into quarters a couple of small potatoes peeled and cubed 1 green capsicum deseeded and chopped here this 1 sliced garlic clove 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of caraway seeds and 1 tablespoon of hot paprika now I know that some of you will be wondering if you can leave that paprika out there are you can't it's integral to the dish it's like asking if you can either chicken out of roast chicken and for the cholesterol the little dumplings that go in the goulash I've got an egg and 3 heaped tablespoons of plain flour I'm drinking heating a tablespoon of oil in a pan add in the onions and I'm just so tiny for a few minutes to soften them once the onions become soft and translucent add in the night so cook gently for about 5-10 minutes the brownies meanwhile put the garlic caraway seeds and salt into a mortar and pestle wash them together looks good to me and smells amazing once the meats browned we can add in the caraway seed garlic and salt mixture the paprika that'll mix well now add in the tomato and one liter of either stock or water stir well and bring to the boil once it comes to the boil cover and simmer gently for an hour and a half meanwhile let's make some little things break the egg into a small bowl whisk it lightly add in a pinch of salt and a little bit of the flour and whisk not in a bit more flour and whisk then add in the rest of the flour and whisk to a stiff ish paste oh that's thick and goopy alright batter now and a half remove the lid add in the potatoes and the capsicum give it a good stir then continue cooking for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender once the potatoes are tender I don't dollops of the paste we shall make you dumplings then allow them to cook for two to three minutes before serving there's nothing ghoulish about this goulash it's awesome so now you know what to serve a hungry Hungarian German next time in titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan until next time could happen
