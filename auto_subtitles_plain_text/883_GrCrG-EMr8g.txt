 I'm going to be doing a different kind of tutorial for you I'm going to show you how to make sushi and one of my personal favorites is a California roll so I'll be showing you how to make that you need are some imitation crab meat avocados rice of course I'm using calbro's rice seaweed rice vinegar mayonnaise this is just a Japanese mayonnaise you could use a regular American mayonnaise toasted sesame seeds and water I'm going to pop the rice and I'm going to mix in some rice vinegar into the rice I'm just going to put about this is about I don't know two cups of rice and I'm going to fill this lid with two levels of rice vinegar and the rice vinegar basically makes the rice sticky I guess some people like mixing the rice vinegar when your rice is hot however when you start rolling or at least in my experience I find that whenever make sushi with hot rice or warm rice the sea we tend to break a lot easier or one more lid pull these are rice is now nice and sticky now let's go ahead and prep the crabmeat I'm going to put some mayonnaise in the crabmeat and you'd be surprised by how much mayonnaise people put in sushi going to put generous amount so first I'm going to show you a really easy way to make sushi and this isn't going to be your typical inside-out roll take the rice and lay it on top of the mat it's important to spread the rice evenly and you just want a thin layer of rice you don't want to pack on too much or also roll is going to be really really big and sometimes you I mean I don't like it too big I'm leaving about an inch or two space so you can feel it now I'm going to take the crab meat and lay a strip of it onto the bottom section of the roll take your avocado and lay it on top and then I like to sprinkle some sesame seeds we once I ate those little tiny eggs that you put in shushu with your little salmon little tobiko there's two kinds of to be go fill the gaudy one is a green senator Oh what is it thanks to Rico's Japanese salmon roe where they mix like wasabi and the Japanese are longer that's a little aged yeah Oh salmon roe eggs our green ones are tobiko what are the orange ones that's just regular salmon roe oh okay thank you okay so I don't have that stuff and I don't like it so I don't put it in my role so instead I put sesame seeds and then you're going to take the bottom and tightly cut I'm making sure it's tight so you look like that and then you're going to continue rolling it so it looks like that and then I'm going to seal it with water kind of like April's if you guys ever made April even this seal this is water and then I'm going to continue to roll there you go there is my sushi roll but this time I'm not going to leave any gaps at the top I have my race on the TV and I'm gonna put it over to the other side so same idea we'll show you how you can set sesame seed on this it's so easy you just sprinkle it on this is a trick that I learned I think I was watching Anthony Bourdain when you went to Japan cut right down the middle and make sure your knife is wet so that way you don't ruin the sushi cut right down the middle and then put them side-by-side start cutting or knowledge and this kind of uglies I'm not an ass but it thanks for watching you
