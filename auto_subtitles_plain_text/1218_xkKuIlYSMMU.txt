 howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen today I will show you how to make corn dogs good times they look amazing right and I want to thank a Schwinn and Brina for suggesting that I make corn dogs with the Super Bowl coming up it's pretty much a no-brainer you're gonna love these now being British I don't really know too much about the Super Bowl I just have a video game at Madden one they just be quite good it just thrown a ball everywhere didn't Reno what I was doing which was kind of cool but I put a joke out on Facebook earlier saying you can get amazing gambling odds on the Chicago Bulls winning the Superbowl I don't see their basketball team it kind of backfired which was British humor I do know a little bit about it I spent four summers of my life out in America of my American family Cindy and Sammy and I never tried a corn dog it's a good thing because these are amazing so I really hope you give them a try it pause on video now what is in green it's down this first up I got my frankfurters and sat them on kitchen towel to make sure they were fully dry and here comes the painful bit I inserted a bamboo skewer all the way into the Frankfurter so it was nice and easy to hold Oh for all the guys watching sorry about that step with the frankfurters all inserted put them to one side and it's time to make our batter so you grab a mixing bowl and combine your flour sugar polenta which is also known as cornmeal salt and baking powder into that bowl and just mix it all together until it's nice and combined add in your beaten egg and half of your milk stirring it initially and then add the rest of it and continue the stir until you've got a lovely smooth batter now to make sure my batter is nice and clean I like an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend it just won't let go I transferred my batter into a jug and then placed it in the fridge while I got on heating up my oil so over a medium flame on a hob I whack down my pan I've filled it with a load of vegetable oil getting it up to temperature with the oil in the pan nice and hot I found it super easy to grab a nice tall glass stick my sausage in it I know that sounds wrong we'll just skip over that beer pour in the killer and then any excess at the top it didn't make I'll just spoon at that extra batter on top until it was fully coated I then sat it into my pan of oil and then it just roll around for three or four minutes until it's nice and golden brown before sitting it on kids I don't like it then was repeat those steps of my remaining frankfurters I even drizzled on a little bit of mustard and I wasn't really sure what people normally have on these I've seen mustard it's quite popular but what do you know we have a new corn dog let me know down below but that is it my friends super easy mmm oh my goodness guys I can see why these are so popular they're pretty darn amazing you got a slits chickweed foamy crunchy layer on the outside just delicate enough mix them well with that mustard so please let me know if this passes your American seal of approval and what you put on yours if you enjoyed this video don't forget that you have thumbs up share subscribe comment all that stuff good luck with the Super Bowl if you cheer it on the Chicago Bulls like I am wink good times guys see you next time bye [Music]
