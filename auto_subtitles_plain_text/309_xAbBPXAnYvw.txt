 in this video I'm going to show you how to make a delicious red miso soup recipe so begin with a pot of water about one-third full and turn the heat on high as your water is heating up go ahead and start with your ginger with the ginger just peel the skin now the trick here is to great your ginger use this side which is the VIP the almost finest side right here and then just great your ginger you're going to have a little fiber left just squeeze that right into the water here's the ginger take all your ginger put it into the water okay the next ingredient will be the burdock root burdock root is very grounding and very good for us so you simply peel it wash the burdock root and then cut up the burdock root cut off the ends slice it down the middle slice it down the middle again notice that the water is boiling that's good let it boil cut up your brew doc root into small pieces and add the burdock root to the soup okay that can boil for a moment or two next comes daikon root daikon root is a radish and it's also a blood purifier simply peel it and then grate it turn your heat on low and then go ahead and prepare your kale just pull it off the stem here bunch it all up and then slice it kale is really really good for you lots of vitamins lots of nutrients should eat it as often as possible next comes broccoli the next ingredient is the almond butter i'm using a whole foods almond butter because it's the least expensive almond butter and ginger are the two key ingredients to this soup add a scoop of almond butter and you have to stir it in the stirring in part is very important you want it to be dissolved into the water you should be on either medium or low heat right now you'll notice that the ginger and the burdock root boiled for at least a minute or two that's what you want okay the almond butter is stirred in now add all your vegetables as it's coming back to a boil go ahead and take some dulse seaweed and put that into the soup I like dull seaweed the best there are other seaweeds out there and dulse is not the one that's popular with miso soup however it dissolves pretty quickly into the soup it's easy to digest it's easy to chew and I think it has a great flavor and it's just starting to boil okay now we're going to turn it on very very low and we're going to add the miso paste so this is me so master red miso it is my very favorite of all me so there and I've tried quite a few the one thing that's particularly unique about this miso is that it in comparison to other me sews it dissolves pretty quickly into the soup so we're going to add several scoops to the soup here's what you do not want to do you do not want to have your soup boiling while you're adding the miso paste it will hurt the live enzymes in the miso paste and it will actually taste burned so i have it on low you notice i'm adding three scoops and I'm stirring it in it's probably going to take four scoops this is all about to flavor the miso paste is what flavors the soup now since it's really hot I'm going to turn the heat off the heat is now off and the whole idea right now is to get the miso paste to dissolve into the soup which basically means constant stirring your soup should have a slightly brown color to it if it's a light brown it might be too light it might not have enough flavor you might need to add more miso paste to it it should have a strong flavor when you taste it in fact i recommend tasting your soup after you've dissolved the miso paste into it I can tell just by looking at it that's going to need a little bit more miso paste I'm going to add a little more and stir it in just keep stirring sometimes you'll find the miso paste in the soup and you'll tap it up against the wall to dissolve it let's see if I can find some here we go so here's some miso paste see it right there you're just going to tap it against the wall to dissolve it in taste your soup that's perfect okay go ahead and serve your soup go ahead and add some flax oil to your soup this is barleans flax oil and it tastes really good and I use it as a condiment has omega-3 fatty acids in it this miso soup is excellent that key to making it is the ginger and the almond butter as long as you have the ginger and the almond butter and the miso paste you will always come up with a great soup no matter what other ingredients you put into it
