 hi everyone I'm Judith well today I'm going to be showing you how to make chicken and black bean burritos this is one of my favorite Mexican snacks so what you'll need for this is one box of Spanish rice one tablespoon of vegetable oil one pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into half-inch pieces one package of taco seasoning mix two thirds of a cup of water one con about 15 ounces of black beans drained and rinsed 1 medium red bell pepper chopped third of a cup of sliced green onions 1/2 a cup of chopped fresh cilantro 1 package of flour tortillas for the burritos about a tortillas heated one-and-a-half cups of shredded cheddar cheese taco seeds and cheese blend or Mexican cheese blend today we'll be using cheddar cheese and some guacamole salsa and sour cream if desired so first of all I have my large skillet here and we have it to a medium heat and all I'm going to do is add in my oil so engels oil let that get nice and hot and then we're going to add the chicken to that so once our oil is hot in our skillet let's add in our chicken so we've cut these into half-inch little pieces and we're going to cook them for about three to four minutes until they're no longer pink make sure to give them a stir occasionally so once our chicken is no longer pink and it's cooked for about 3-4 minutes it's now time to add in our water so in goes the water and the taco seasoning mix so that's just going to give it lots of nice flavor in there give it a stir so we're going to cook that for another three to four minutes or until most of the water is absorbed so our chicken is now done it should be nice and moist and not dry just as we want it so let's get our bowl of rice and to our rice we're going to add in the chicken mixture so once the chicken is in there we can then add our remaining ingredients so our black beans going in there I just love full of protein and fiber our green onions of course our cilantro just going to give it a lovely freshness and our pepper in it all goes and then we're going to give it a good stir so all those flavors all mixed up together Oh looking and smelling very colorful and fantastic already great so here if you want to add any additional salt and pepper you can go ahead but that taco seasoning mix had so much flavor already that I'm not going to need to put in too much all right so that is done so now it's time to roll up our burritos lots of fun so let's get our flour GTOs which we've warmed according to package instructions and let's just do one first all right so get your spoon and we're just going to add in the middle we'll go down and we'll add about 3/4 of a cup to a cup of the mixture inside good now on top of that let's sprinkle on some of our cheese your cheese of preference of course on there and then we're going to wrap it up so from the bottom we'll wrap over about an inch over the top of the mixture and then on the sides we're going to wrap that over once wrap the other side over so it covers the other side be careful because your tortillas might break up easily and of course then just wrap on the remaining side and if your tortillas are big enough they will fit don't overcrowd your tortillas of course with with the mixture because you want to fold them nicely so we can pop that on the plate and we're going to do the same with the remaining tortillas perfect so there you go there'll be a great treat for when your friends come over or for the family I really really love this Mexican dish so that's how you make chicken and black bean burritos
