 hello and welcome to the art of cooking today we are going to make goombas eating or compiled chicken as it is known in the West now as you might notice there is actually no vegetables in this dish well that's because this version is actually the original citron version which uses chicken as its primary ingredient the characteristics of this dish is tender chicken crispy peanuts with a combination of numbing spicy sweet and sour sauce let's prepared by starting the sauce first T tablespoon plus one teaspoon of sugar 1 teaspoon of salt some rice wine one and a half tablespoon of soy sauce and 1/4 teaspoon of salt this is optional 2 teaspoon of chili oil one teaspoon of hot pepper powder or chili powder this is optional 1/4 cup or 60 milliliter unsalted chicken stock or water and start also another additional ingredient 2 tablespoon of black vinegar do not mix it with the sauce 3 clothes or 1 tablespoon of minced garlic 1 tablespoon of minced ginger top three spurts of green onions separate the white part from the green part the green part will be used as a garnish while the white part will be used for cooking cut 12 to 15 dried chilies in half if you like extra spicy cut the seeds with it otherwise discard it prepare the chicken thigh trim away the fats and cut the thickest part of the thighs and a half this will ensure the thighs cook evenly next cut the chicken into strips approximately 1 inch or 2.54 centimeters then cut it into bite-size pieces now if you don't want to use thighs you can use breasts as well you can also use shrimp beef pork doesn't have to be chicken so now it's time to marinade here are 14 ounce or 400 grams of chicken pot 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1 tablespoon of soy sauce 1 tbsp salt shame rice wine or regular rice wine mix until all the liquids absorb once all the liquids are absorbed add in one tablespoon of cornstarch and mix until there is no powder so it should look like this once it's like this add in half a tablespoon of oil and mix this oil will actually prevents it from sticking to the wok so when you cook it it separates easily next let's prepare the slurry mixture 1 teaspoon of potato starch plus one teaspoon of water now let's get cooking in a wok or pan add in 2 tbsp of oil turn the fire to the lowest setting add in about 1/4 to 1/3 TSP of Sichuan peppercorn I didn't Drudge Lee's sautee the chilies for about 15 to 20 seconds or until fragrant add in the chicken and spread that leg out because it's getting hot in here turn the heat to medium setting and let it cook for about 30 seconds before flipping the chicken over ladies and gentlemen as you have observed despite the low heat the chicken didn't stick to the wok that's because of the oil that we put in the marinade cook the other side for about 20 seconds then add in the green onions garlic and ginger and stir fry for about 20 to 30 seconds I didn't the sauce and let it cook in the sauce for about 20 seconds at this point the chicken is about 60 to 70% cooked because we cut it small and relatively thin the time to cook the thighs is around 3 minutes no more than 4 minutes at this point adding this luring mixture and mix until it's thickened once this thickens turn off the heat and add in 1/2 cup or 75 grams of roasted peanuts mix until the peanuts are well combined with the sauce lastly with the fire off add in the black vinegar and quickly mix the reason we add the vinegar at the last stage of cooking with the fire off is because we don't want to lose the city of the vinegar if you added with the other sauce you basically cook away the city of the vinegar by the way just FYI when I use wok for stir frying I always heated the wok until it's hot then turn off the fire and add in cold oil the wok actually is still hot but cold enough that doesn't actually burn the food wha at the same time producing a nonstick surface oh one more thing I forgot to mention after you infuse the peppercorns flavor into the oil you may want to remove the peppercorns from the oil unless you want to piss someone off then leave them in there which I did and I pissed my brother off that's what brothers are for thank ins for watching and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial please like fav subscribe and leave a comment below thank you
