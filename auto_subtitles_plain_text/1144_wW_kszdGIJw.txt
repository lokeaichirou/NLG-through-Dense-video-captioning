 my guys if you like your takeaway meals but you wanna make some extra special healthy and make them at home then this is the recipe for you I'm going to show you how to make Singapore noodles in so easy and best of all you can use lots of veggies and whack your veggie content so I'm going to start off with is chopping our veggies but I do need to tell you that I have marinated it some chicken strips with a little bit of soy sauce some oyster sauce and some garlic and ginger and you leave that to sit while you get on with the rest of your recipe so time to chop up my veggies I'm gonna start with my garlic so just want a nice fine chop on your garlic and you don't have to be too careful but I do like when I do like Asian dishes that there's a nice kind of difference in texture so you got a little bit of fine slicing going on stuff that's my garlic with your ginger what you want to do is take off the skin so just run a knife around the sides of this and just grab one of these babies if you've never used one of these they're microplane grater and they are absolutely fantastic for getting the most out of your ginger or chilli and then they're going to use it for my ginger now give this one a good grade down I'm using a lot of ginger because I love ginger and you do want to get a bit of a hit of it so about two thumb sized pieces will do the job here right that's my ginger so chop up the veggies spring onions celery and carrot and you can use whatever veggies you want here peppers aubergine courgettes it's up to you I'm really given my veggies a nice thin Chuck they will cook much quicker and now we're joined in the kitchen by the star of the show max the dog everybody hiya Maxie hey okay he's just calm cause he thinks his food so I better crack on and get his dinner ready right time to get that wok nice and hot so heat goes on now the thing when you're making an Asian dish or any stir-fry is to make sure that your wok is hot and that is the biggest mistake people mess the biggest mistake people make even the reason you get a gloopy sloppy stir-fry is because your wok is not hot if it's really hot like that you get this fiery heat that really cooks it nice and quick and that's exactly what I'm looking for now so I'm gonna let that heat off I'm gonna get a little drop of sunflower oil in there and you want to keep it heating until it's just the base starts smoking and when it starts smoking you know that it's nice and hot and ready to rock we've got that lovely marinated chicken and this goes straight in it's just fizzle but stick with it you need to make sure that your wok is nice and hot and as soon as that sizzle dies down you've got a beautiful cooking wall that isn't going to reducing its heat so give it a good mix through fry it off and you want to cook this just until that chicken is just a bit cooked through right come in here and check this out we've got beautifully cooked chicken at this point so this is the way you need it to be before you transfer it out the chicken is nice and firm as cook true so transfer it over to a place and get that pan straight back on the heat add another little bit of olive oil or sunflower oil or rapeseed oil in little drop goes in and there you need to hit it with those great flavors so I'm going to start off with a little bit of the garlic and ginger straight into the pan and give it a good mix through and as soon as those ginger and garlic pieces start to become aromatic you want to hit it with all those veggies oh if you could smell this right now you will be making this for your dinner tonight try it out okay veggies go in pile our spring onions our celery and our carrot in there and we've got some bean sprouts as well and now all you need to do is mix it room in with a drop of sesame oil for a nice nutty hit about a teaspoon no more it's quite strong and then some oyster sauce gives Agra lovely kind of rounded salty flavor and for the folk color and saltiness I've got some direct soya sauce and do try and get the dark soya sauce here because it really does make a difference to the color and the taste there's a little bit of molasses in there so it's really deepens the flavor once those veggies are nice and tender but they still have a bite the chicken goes straight back in we're gonna add in some precooked noodles you can use rice noodles egg noodles whatever you have yourself and now the final ingredient a little bit of curry powder so get that in there you want to add that just at the last minute little bit extra from those mix up through I wanna have the best utensil from to do this hang on one sec where we have this is the only way to mix true your noodles so grab these babies and just get in there I know what you call these I like to think of them as aardvark hands so just mix the true with those and get your noodles completely coated okay now you don't want to overcook it so just whack off the heat it's all gone very quiet and calm now as soon as you turn off the heat is just kind of calms down a little bit so tumble this out onto a nice big serving platter look at that these are serious noodles you'll never have to dial the take away again look easy nice sprinkle of some spring onions over the top and now others have to do is taste it so I'm gonna grab a fork this is worth waiting for have a little swirl of noodle a little bit of chicken a little bit of veggies give it a go it's so good it really is I mean if you've ever made a stir-fry and hasn't worked out for you give this recipe a go it works every time it's so tasty and I
