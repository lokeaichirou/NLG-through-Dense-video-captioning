schnitzel alright yes I love it we're gonna learn how to do that right now you go and the potatoes yeah probably the best thing ever roasted roasted potatoes with onions and bacon and just salt and pepper when you know when the chef says that that you've got to do this recipe so show us how to do it it's easy right absolutely okay how do we start hearing easy now what I used are fingerling potatoes this one I cooked roughly I don't know I think like eight nine ten minutes or so okay boiled it just boils and boil it with the skin and then you peel off the skin no skin on your particular never skin on German roast potatoes never okay never know okay anyway so that's what I did already okay and then you cut them nice and thin was a quarter inch yeah perfect something all right now we did that we cut we cut some onions and Julian all right I know Laura did that already so of course a bad she told me she really wanted to do it again with no we have enough we have plenty of onions we got some bacon and just cut in nice little stripes you can also cut it in little cubes correct that's the whole preparation so where we start up a pen we have a nice hot pan yeah put a little oil in it Laura he's gonna make me do this one but I love potatoes so this is gonna be easy tell me how much oil a little less than a quarter inch nope no more that's actually perfect now we're gonna start with the potatoes the potatoes already cut I was grabbing for the onion that's what it oh yeah that's what the order the order is the way we started potatoes first okay because the potatoes take the longest to get nice and crispy and cook we're gonna let it cook just for a little bit not right well let that cook but we gonna get to the pork let's try that okay we gonna start to make the v national club okay now i have like a whole pork loin here already cleaned up when you go to your butcher you can get them already cut in three or four arms pieces right and what i did you panted it out i pound it a trapeze alone already but i want you to pound run that's the fun part I like that what we gonna use is we're gonna use a ziploc bag okay open it up and no I gonna help you with that and then you gonna pound it we want to give it a nice whack I feel like I'm beating them hit it hit it Laura okay hit it you see we can feel it now wonderful reading it starts out with salt and pepper
