 all right let's make some hummus this is the most traditional and basic way simply using lemon garlic chickpeas olive oil and salt usually tahini is included which is just ground sesame seed book that adds a lot of fat so I chose to leave it out for this recipe all right so let's start by opening the can of chickpeas draining out the liquid and then setting them aside for a minute and now what I'm going to do is chop up the garlic simply using a food processor if you don't have a food processor or a blender you can use a knife to chop up the garlic this dish is traditionally made with a mortar and pestle or you can use a spoon and a bowl but this is just for convenience and it chops it up a little bit easier all right so once you've chopped up the garlic go ahead and add the chickpeas now or later let's just set that aside so you can Samurai chop your lemon in half this is a crucial part making some kind of ninja move before you cut the lemon otherwise your hummus will not come out right all right so now we're gonna add the juice from just half of the lemon you can always add more later but you can't take it away give it a few quick pulses just to chop it up and mix in the lemon juice and now go ahead and add one tablespoon of olive oil again you can always add more or less depending on your macros or depending on the consistency that you like and you may need to add a little bit of liquid I chose to just add water so I don't add additional calories you can add some more lemon juice or olive oil just so it blends up a little bit better and becomes a bit more creamy now you can go ahead and any additional spices or sauces that you would like I'm sticking with just black pepper and some sea salt again I have made many different kinds of hummus and that's the best part about it you can make it with basil and pesto you can make a roasted red pepper buffalo sauce and make a buffalo hummus roasted pine nuts sun-dried tomatoes jalapenos roasted garlic Greek and olive anything you could think of that you want to mix into this dip or paste feel free to do so the best part about hummus is the versatility of the dish it can be used in salads as a spread on a sandwich instead of mayo or dressing you can dip crackers in it vegetables in it this is the macros for the entire Boal it can serve more than one person unless you're really hungry you can also significantly lower the macros by taking out the tablespoon of olive oil and replacing that liquid with water or lemon juice or something like that just to get rid of some of the fat if you choose to do so anyway if you enjoyed this recipe don't forget to like the video and subscribe for more as always I appreciate the support and I'll catch you in the next one
