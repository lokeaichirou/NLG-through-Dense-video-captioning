 hi friends this week I'm sharing a dish that will please even the pickiest palates this recipe for stir-fried egg noodles is a favorite among my friends and colleagues and often requested for our get-togethers when cooking for a group keep in mind meat preferences and food allergies this recipe can be easily adjusted to accommodate these needs here's what we need to make this dish thin egg noodles garlic carrots celery onion bok choy soy sauce oyster sauce sugar vegetable oil and ground black pepper we also need roast pork I shared this video recipe earlier so please click the link or see my channel for the recipe feel free to use another meat of your choice such as chicken beef or seafood for vegetarian options use pan-fried seitan or tofu or we can omit the meat altogether we start by removing the fresh egg noodles from the packaging now gently unravel and loosen each of the bundles using kitchen shears cut the strands so they are shorter this will make it easier to cook and eat later next bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil drop in the noodles and then swirl around in the hot water for 30 seconds as the noodles are really thin we don't want to overcook them now we drain the noodles in a large colander we rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process toss the noodles in the colander and try to remove as much of the water as possible now let's spread out the noodles on several large platters or trays and let them air-dry for 2 hours it's important that the noodles are dry before stir frying otherwise they will be soft and mushy for the roast pork or any meat of your choice we just need to cut into thin strips smash the garlic and then remove the skin now we can finally mince it for the carrots cut into thin slices I'm cutting at a slight angle and then we cut into thin strips cut the celery stock into 2-inch sections and then again we cut each of the sections into thin strips the onion just needs to be cut into thin slices for the bok choy separate the leafy part from the stem cut the stem just like we did the celery into thin strips cut the bok choy leaves in half and then just give them a rough chop the vegetables are prepped and we can continue with the next steps to make the stir-fry sauce let's combine two tablespoons of soy sauce 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce and 1 teaspoon of sugar just give it a quick stir to mix everything together next let's heat a large wok over medium-high heat and when it's nice and hot drizzle in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil swirl the wok slightly to evenly coat it with the oil now add the minced garlic and quickly stir fry for 10 seconds add the carrots and stir fry for 1 minute next add the celery and again stir fry for 1 minute add the onions and bok choy stems and stir fry for 1 minute let's add the bok choy leaves now and toss everything together stir fry for about a minute until the leaves are wilted now turn off the heat add 2 tablespoons of the stir-fry sauce and then mix everything together finish by adding some freshly ground black pepper now scoop out the veggies and place in a clean bowl we will be stir-frying these vegetables again so they don't need to be completely cooked at this time heat the same wok over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil add the noodles making sure to spread them out on the surface of the wok if you have a smaller wok you may need to cook in a few batches try not to stir fry too many noodles at once or they may clump together stir-fry the noodles for about 6 to 7 minutes tossing and then spreading them out in the wok so they don't clump too if the noodles start to stick together drizzle in a little bit more vegetable oil now we can add back the vegetables add the roast pork or your choice of meat toss everything together combining all the ingredients drizzle in the remaining stir-fry sauce add some more black pepper stir fry for another two minutes and then we're all finished enjoy this as a main entree or a side dish hi I hope you've enjoyed this easy how-to video if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post below for full recipes check out runaway rice calm I work on new recipes each week so please subscribe to my channel to stay tuned this is trying wishing you good eating and good health thanks for watching
