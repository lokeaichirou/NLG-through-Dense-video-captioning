 Allrecipes member Paula tells us that these vietnamese fresh spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual Fried variety and have become a family favorite they are great as a cool summertime appetizer and are delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces let's start by getting the filling ingredients ready first bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil add in 2 ounces of rice vermicelli and cook it for 1 to 2 minutes until the vermicelli is just cooked but still firm drain the pasta and rinse it with cold water so the pasta doesn't stick together then chop enough fresh Thai basil to make 1 and 1/3 generous tablespoons and finely chopped 3 tablespoons of fresh mint leaves as well as three tablespoons of fresh cilantro and to clean lettuce leaves now wash and peel eight large cooked shrimp and cut them in half next fill a wide high-sided plate with warm water dip 1/8 and a half inch rice wrapper into the water for about a second just to soften it then lay the wrapper flat on the clean surface place two shrimp halves in the center of the wrapper and make a row with a handful of vermicelli some chopped basil some mint some cilantro and some lettuce keep an eye on your quantities because you want to fill each role with an equal amount of all ingredients leave about two inches on each side fold the uncovered part of the wrapper inward then tightly roll up the wrapper beginning at the end with the lettuce in exactly the same way go ahead and fill and roll the remaining seven rappers step the spring rolls aside on a serving plate while you make the two different sauces in a small bowl combine four teaspoons of fish sauce with a quarter of a cup of water and two tablespoons of fresh lime juice now mids one clove of garlic and add that plus two tablespoons of white sugar and finally half of a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce whisk that together and that's the first sauce for the second sauce finely chopped 1 teaspoon of peanuts put them in a bowl then add about three tablespoons of hoisin sauce and mix them together serve your spring rolls with both sauces if you can't find Thai basil double the amount of cilantro to keep the flavor of your spring rolls bright and fresh
