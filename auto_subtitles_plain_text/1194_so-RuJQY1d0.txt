 [Music] Hey so in the same oil in your paneer tips and things lightly saute until they're a nice golden brown drain off all the excess oil in the same oil nothing sizzle a little bit and our whole masala again which is our cinnamon stick whole toast baby and black part of them this time give it a quick stir and we're gonna add in our sliced onions again we don't want them to just integrate while we're doing this so just a nice golden brown that's good enough huh and this mixture we're gonna go ahead and add a little bit of turmeric powder and we're using right we're using about a tablespoon of this masala but it depends on your taste if it's such as spicy for you you can cut back a little bit or put more you get that a good mix and those gonna solve him and then we're going to add in our marinated vegetables you give it one final mix [Music] we go ahead and I have a little bit more solder but it's not enough that's a nicely mix so we're gonna go ahead and cover this and cook it and smell the vegetables about 3/4 way done again the rest of this stuff is gonna get cooked in the oven later on so you definitely want to make sure it's overcooked right now let's check out our veggies now I have been stirring that's off and on you know every couple of minutes just to make sure that we stick on the bottom and again we want these about 3/4 of the way cook and the way we're gonna test this out is we're going to take like one piece of potato kind of put a knife through it all right so it goes all the way through but you can feel a little bit of tension in there it's not a broad tension but it's smooth engine in there and if it does that then you know it's perfect so we'll switch off Forester and we're gonna add back in our veneer pieces and also our cashews and the walnuts and then we're gonna add some Tomatoes copper to again chopped nice and big it's adds a lot of colors and having a firm tomato will really help yes or actually you can use change the Middle's of like tomatoes as well and finally we have some yogurt we're going to need a little bit absolutely this is roughly be just for that name and just mix it so it coats even and this process that you have to do very gently because otherwise the cauliflower will just break so just do it as gently as possible that's it it's ready to layer okay I'm gonna go ahead and just fluff up the rice one more time very gently and while she's doing that I'm going to cover the bottom and sides of our baking dish with some spray cooking oil so we're gonna put one layer of rice down on the bottom now basically we're gonna have three layers of rice so you can split your rice up into three parts and and you'll know how much to put into it and on top of the rice we're gonna go ahead and sprinkle a little bit of our biryani masala just a little on top for our additional flavor actually this is also going to taste if you want it spicier you're good or go easy definitely because it is a little on the spicy side and also we're going to layer one layer of our veggies on top of here and now this is vegetable biryani so we are very generous on the vegetables now you don't want any buns a lot of rice than nice ample supply of vegetables here so there's that two layers of vegetable so you can divide this into twos now we're going to sprinkle a little bit of our fright and use this really adds a nice crunch and a nice flavor you can try to do this at home but it's a lot simpler to survive it and it always comes out so perfect now another layer breasts and then after this we're just going to press down very lightly it helps it to just pack in the way I sleep and cook well a little layer of our grandma's health so putting about 1 TSP of masala between every day so just a good measure our second layer of veggies oh yes and by the way our oven has been going on at 400 degrees it's preheated very well and it's ready for the very Ani very nice and one more layer of our okay and our less laborious now the last layer is always a little bit -
