 hey what's up guys I'm Matty Matheson I'm gonna chef at parts and labor I'm the Burger King what's up you're here in my house in Parkdale there's kids smoking crack outside there's Tibetans having a rally for freedom I'm about to show you guys how to make a beautiful cheeseburger the best cheeseburger you've ever had here we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] get it out of this container [Music] what makes it an amazing burger there's a few things that make an amazing burger you got to start with really good beef so we have the beef chuck here which is part of the cow shoulder you know it has a lot of fat content it's a little bit tougher there's a good chew on it so that's why you grind it so we're just going to cut this up in little strips so here it's just better to grind your own meat because you're in total control you grind it it's the fresh it's this is not no frills down on King Street and Parkdale gypsy meat you don't trim off any of this fat keep it in there the ratio will work itself out I always find you don't have a meat grinder go to a butcher shop and get them to grind your beef fresh the main thing that people always do is with the patties and put garlic in it where's your Shire parsley crap eggs breadcrumbs all you have to use is good beef and treat like a steak but don't with the just make a beef patty and that's all you need we have our ground beef here so now we just have to make the patties you want to make it into a fat patty so it's nice and juicy just kind of like use your one hand patting it up and then your patting it down and then your patting it around you got a pretty good patty right and we'll start with four for burgers a family of four see a lot of people cook them on grills I prefer to cook them in like cast-iron pans like a griddle because when I find when people are cooking burgers on grills either fall apart and that's why people always add crap to it to keep them together what we want to do is sear these see all this fat these are all gonna melt away so that's gonna create these little cavernous crispy fat chunk pieces and then you're gonna have a perfect burger so when you cook burgers medium high heat and a cast-iron pan is your best bet so you want to make it sure that it's not too hot because you're gonna burn it burn be taste like  so you're gonna just treat it like so you're gonna just treat it like a steak right I've already said that so we got the pepper heavily seasoned with salt cuz it's a fat piece of meat flip it over do the same thing because of the fat in here you actually don't really have to put fat in the pan about a 6 ounce burgers the burgers that we made today you want to cook those about three and a half to four minutes aside for a nice medium remember so now we're just gonna let these guys cook and render I think the best technique for burger toppings is not to make these big fat things that are gonna slide everywhere I like to make a lot of thin slices so that when you crunch really it's like a thousand layers and so you don't get these like big slide around tomatoes all these guys out in the world when you're cutting these onions and you're crying is because you have a dull knife a dull knife means you're a loser you don't cry if you cut an onions with a sharp knife any good sandwich worth its weight has pickles in it if the sandwich doesn't have pickles in it it's probably gonna be garbage throw it on the floor walk away then we need iceberg lettuce shaved up I got some peperoncinis I like it taking a bite of the burger take a bite of the pepper Cheney a little spice a little heat and that's all you need for toppings what we're looking for when we're cooking the burgers is that the sides are gonna start turning brown you know like when you're cooking pancakes and around the edges you know when to poke the pancakes you get the little bubbles around the side that bubble is the Browning of the side of the beet that means that it's golden brown underneath and it's starting to cook that's exactly what I'm looking for see all those little crevices that's the fat rendering out staying juicy in the middle super  crunchy on the top the other crunchy on the top the other component is obviously really good  buns right here is a beautiful buns right here is a beautiful egg bun see that yellow color egg one it just seems a little bit lighter than the like the Wonder Bread this smoosh I need to toast up some buns ours gotta be butter in the buns cuz you ain't got butter buns they're not gonna be good so these burgers are almost done this is a huge brick of American cheese cheese makes it creamy and yummy this is the real deal this isn't Kraft single cheese they can look like a star David the land of milk and honey good movie all the best things in the world are simple right like a hot babe on the beach she's got her hair she's kind of naked that's good this is the same way you don't want your all messed up this is the bikini this is the sand this is the tequila you're drinking this is the babe right here think of a cheeseburger as a babe you want to with the babe too much right so we're gonna steam the burgers because we want the cheese to melt a little more so we're gonna just add a little bit of water put a bowl on top or a plate just see him for a little bit you don't want to cook them too much whoo they're done cooking okay see that steam hey world cheesy burgers what you know about it and I'll dress these guys up so we got the lettuce on the bottom we've got the patty I got some onion and that's a tomato some pickle you got some mustard I got the ketchup and some  peppers these are the best peppers these are the best cheeseburgers you'll ever have this is a perfect cheeseburger right here these two pools are about to eat the best burger of their lives they're extremely lucky today all right it's a big boy burger no baby dick burgers over here sometimes you don't have to eat a burger don't eat a burger while you're in church don't eat a burger when you're getting a that's how you make a burger eat some burgers world eat them they're good for you look at me you
