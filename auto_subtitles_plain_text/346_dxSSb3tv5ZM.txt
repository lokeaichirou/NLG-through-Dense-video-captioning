 okay so today I'm gonna teach you guys how to make galbi which are Korean style short ribs and these are basically just beef short ribs that have been marinated in a sort of sweet soy marinade and then grilled so we're gonna start with some green onions just chopped two or three of them in a bowl and we're just making our marinade here so an important component here is actually pair so I've chalked up a pair here could put in a few cloves of garlic I think we take my immersion blender just puree it all now what the pair does is they contribute some sugar there's a lot of sugar this marinade but also I've heard that the enzymes in the pair actually I'll tenderize the meat so we'll add a few a few tablespoons here of brown sugar again there's a lot of sugar in this Meritage and the reason for this is when you actually cook it it sort of acts like glaze you get a lot of carmelization then we're gonna put in about about a hundred milliliters of soy sauce I'm here I'm using tamari which is Japanese obviously it shouldn't be in a Korean dish but I really love the flavor of tamari and I very video but you don't have to use it you can substitute and then well that's a mirror here we're gonna add about 40 or 50 milliliters and again this is adding more sugar and I like to add just a splash of rice vinegar just to sort of grind it up it's very sweet on its own but it's heard of bouncing then about a couple tablespoons of honey more sugar and then we're just put some grants in black pepper and that's pretty much it for a glaze so you can just combine all the ingredients I'll give it a good stir here to make sure everything fixed up man just fish it off whoops pouring a little bit of sesame oil a little bit is all I have so now on to the meat so these are just beef short ribs you want them cut across the bone these guys are a little bit bigger than they should be but you can see the defining characters are short ribs got a lot of intramuscular fat so they're very flavorful but unfortunately this muscle gets used a lot so so here I've got about a centimeter thick ones you might want to go a little bit there you want to keep them nice and thin so they're not too tough to eat traditionally what you do is you actually use cuts along a single rib and you butterfly the meat but this way is a lot easier to do this for them as if walk back and marinate for at least an hour or so or overnight you can see that the meat actually turns around there which means that they're good to go so I live in a basement I have no barbecue so instead I have to make do with my good old castle 57 or 58 degrees Celsius just above the end result just garnish little green onions and you're good to go it's nice easy supper I hope you enjoy
