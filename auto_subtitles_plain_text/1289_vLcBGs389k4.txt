 hey everybody thomas joseph here with another kitchen conundrum well not technically a kitchen conundrum but it is something that everybody's looking forward to this time of year and that is gameday treats and today i'm gonna show you one of the things that's really close to me and that is buffalo chicken wings because i am from Buffalo so I'm gonna show you that buffalo chicken wings are really easy to make at home and you don't need to spend the money going out and buying them for the game day to start I had a large Dutch oven here filled with about four inches of neutral oil so that is like a safflower oil a canola oil any vegetable oil something that can go up to a high high heat and to this pot I'm going to add a wire rack now this is one of my favorite tricks here whenever I'm deep-frying putting a rack in the bottom of the pot what that does is it helps to fry things nice and evenly just use some tongs to help yourself out there so what that wire rack does is it helps to lift the food off the bottom of the pan so you get really nicely evenly cooked food without any brown or burnt spots from hitting the bottom I'm gonna use a deep fat thermometer here this is a candy thermometer and I need to heat the oil up to about 400 degrees and now while this oil comes up to heat I'm gonna show you how to cut the wings into the appropriate sized pieces this is what you're gonna get at your supermarket this is a chicken wing here and I'm going to separate it into three parts the first part here is the drumette and all you have to do is look for the joint of the chicken wing cut through the skin bend it a little bit and it should pop out the joint should pop out right there and now you know where to cut so this is the drumette and so this portion believe it or not is called the wing net you want to do the same thing here where you you take the wing tip which is this portion you break the joint and then you should be able to cut cleanly through we're not gonna fry up this wing tip here place this in a resealable plastic bag in your freezer and you'll have this for whenever you need to make chicken stock and here you go your wing net so our oil is almost up to temperature and for the wings take a piece of paper towel here and gently dab off any excess moisture because if you have excess moisture on your chicken wings once you place them in the hot oil they're really gonna spatter up so dry them off really well you don't want your wings to be too cold either so don't take these right out of the refrigerator and plunge them into the oil otherwise it will lower the temperature of the oil dramatically and your wings will take that much longer to cook so the chicken wings are nice and dry now you want to work in batches you don't want to throw all of the wings in at once because it will lower the temperature of the oil and the grease will absorb into the chicken wings and that's not something you want so gently place the wings into the pot and that rack is really great because the wings do sink down to the bottom they're not gonna rest on the bottom of the pot they're gonna be elevated up and I'm using about 4 pounds of chicken wings total try to fry your drum s in one batch and your wing ATS in another batch don't mix them up too much because they do have slightly different cooking times but in general the wings will cook about 15 to 20 minutes in total so I'm on my last batch of wings here and you want to make sure that when you pull the wings out of the oil you transfer them onto a wire rack don't put them onto paper towel because what that does is that direct contact with a paper towel it creates scheme and one side of your wing will get soggy so use a wire rack to drain them off and to cool them slightly now while I'm working on my last batch here I'm gonna start the sauce and the sauce is the most important thing for your wings all it really is is two ingredients so I have Franks red sauce here that is the real secret ingredient so I have one cup I'm gonna place it into the bottom of a small saucepan here and I'm gonna bring this up to heat just to a bare simmer it's just up to a bare simmer you can see some bubbles forming and now I'm going to add the butter so I've one cup of hot sauce and I'm going to add four tablespoons of cold unsalted butter and gradually add it in whisking until it combines if you wanted a more mild wing all you have to do is increase the butter a little bit so doing a two to one ratio hot sauce to butter will give you a mild wing this is a a four to one ratio the butter is nicely incorporated into the hot sauce I'm gonna turn the heat off and let this cool down slightly before dressing the wings this batch is finally done it's been about 20 minutes right onto the wire rack to drain so now the chicken wings are gonna go right into a bowl here to use a bowl that's wide enough that you can actually toss the wings I'm gonna do about half of the batch here I'll add about half of the sauce around the side of the bowl just swirl the wings around if you're feeling a little daring here you can gently toss the wings up to coat them evenly so our buffalo wings wouldn't be complete without a little bit of blue cheese dip and that basically is some Mayo a little bit of sour cream some blue cheese of course a little bit of lemon and salt and pepper it's the perfect accompaniment to these spicy wings cuz it helps to cool them off a little bit so there you have it buffalo chicken wings my recipe to you so if you have any kitchen conundrums that you need
