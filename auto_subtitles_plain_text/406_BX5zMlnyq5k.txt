 the bully I welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana and buh-bye oh one more the Benes recipe a very authentic salad called ass tabbouleh in this salad bulgur wheat is used which is available in the continent of the Mediterranean region but in India it's not so readily available so we are using broken wheat in place of it if you get bulgur wheat go ahead and use it it becomes more authentic let's go ahead with the ingredients 2 cups of boiled broken wheat one cup chopped parsley 1 cup chopped tomatoes 1 cup chopped spring onions 1/2 cup mint chopped 4 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp sumac powder salt to taste few cabbage cups for serving let's go ahead and make the salad a very simple recipe all you require is fresh ingredients and good mixing let's take the boiled broken wheat if you're using bulgur wheat it doesn't require to be boiled bulgur wheat has to be just soaked in boiling water and drained in running water this is broken wheat which you've taken so this requires boiling for 10 minutes it's boiled and then it is chilled parsley tomatoes mint spring onions lemon juice salt olive oil and sumac sumac is a powder again readily available they're a little difficult to get it here it's a nice berry it's a fruit which is dried and powdered it's got saunas in it and little sweet tinge just mix the ingredients very lightly toss it and chill it chill it in the fridge for half an hour before serving the tabbouleh salad is chilled so let's get it out from the fridge and serve it in the cabbage cups it is nice and chilled so let's serve it in the cabbage cups you can serve them in a nice bed of lettuce in a big plate but I am serving them in the individual cabbage cup Co as you can see that the boule salad is ready it's nice and chilled a lovely salad for a nice summer afternoon you can serve it in the cabbage cups as I've done it or in a bed of lettuce you
