 I don't know what it is about the monsoons but it just makes me crave crispy and crunchy food and that's why I love onion rings but what I don't like about them is just how greasy the fried ones can be which is why my version is baked but don't worry it's just as crispy and crunchy as the fried ones I'm going to start I've already cut the onions into nice half-inch sounds and now I'm going to make the batter and to make a nice thick batter I've got two tablespoons of Consular here I'm going to add half a cup of all-purpose flour okay so I'm just going to give it a good mix and what I've got here is one cup of buttermilk it's going to give a nice tangy flavour to the onion rings when they're ready and to this mixture I'm just going to add half of the buttermilk and just whisk it really rigorously it's going to look lumpy and you'll think that you've done something wrong but just hang on this is going to come together in movements now add the rest of the buttermilk again just whisk it till you have no lumps left just work it slightly it's a bit of an arm workout but it's worth it just put that aside and move on to the crumbs now so what I've got here are panko bread crumbs I'm going to just season them with salt pepper be generous with these seasonings because this is what will give it all of that flavor and because it's me and you should know this by now that I will always add just a little bit of paprika just give that a good mix okay so now I've got the batter and the crumbs nice and seasoned and now it's time to just start putting the onion rings together I've got my oven preheating to 220 degrees Celsius and this baking tray is lined with parchment paper so I'm good just dump this in the batter and use a separate hand to coat it with the bread crumbs and keep it here on the parchment and just make sure you use either separate hands or separate forks or tongs to do this you don't want the same hand going into the batter and the crumbs just keep lining the baking tray with these onion rings we are just 15 minutes away from eating crispy crunchy baked onion rings halfway through the baking time to take the trays and flip the onion rings so that they cook evenly on both sides guys I promised you crispy and crunchy judge for yourself so good you
