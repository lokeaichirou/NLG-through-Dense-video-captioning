 get everyone and welcome today I'm making one of my all-time favorites and it is so delicious and so easy to make at home so for starters you'll of course need some chicken now I've cut up a whole chicken here into pieces you can of course buy your chicken pieces pre-cut I've got a couple of drumsticks the thighs the wings with half of the breasts attached and the other half of the breasts I'm using a 1 kilo chicken for this I find that larger chickens take too long to cook and the outer coating becomes overcooked so stick around the 1 kilo mark now for the seasoning I've got 1 cup of plain flour 1 tablespoon of salt a teaspoon of ground black pepper about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper now this doesn't make it hot it just gives it a bit of a kick 1/2 a tablespoon of garlic powder a tablespoon of onion powder a teaspoon of dried mixed herbs and now for the secret ingredient that will make it super crunchy I've got some instant potato mash powder and I'm going to add in half a cup of this give this a good mix together and it's time to prepare the chicken so here I'm just taking a piece of chicken and I'm just going to dip it in some egg wash which is just a couple of beaten eggs mixed with a little bit of water and then into the flour mix and onto a plate and I'm going to repeat this for all of the chicken pieces and set it to one side for 20 minutes and then it's time to do it again so into the egg wash back into the flour and what this does is it gives it a lovely thick coating and this will help make that chicken super crunchy so again just repeat this for all of the chicken leave it to one side for 20 minutes before cooking and it's time to fry it so here I've got some canola oil preheated to 180 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit I'm just going to gently place in half of those chicken pieces you don't want to overcrowd your oil here and I'm going to cook this for 15 minutes turning it every 3 to 4 minutes and this will ensure the chickens cooked nice and evenly and once it's done I'm remove it from the fryer and place it onto a rack to remove any excess oil and just repeat this step for the rest of your chicken and this is what you get guys be sure to leave it for about ten minutes or so before digging in so you don't burn your mouth and enjoy now this recipe is so delicious that extra crunch really tops off your standard fried chicken so give it a go if you want some more recipes check out my barbecue cooking channel my Google+ and my Facebook pages I'll put the links down in the description bar along with a full list of ingredients for today's recipe thanks for watching and I will catch you all next time
