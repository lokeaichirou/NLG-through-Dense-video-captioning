 hi anyhow I'm chef Tom welcome to fortune cooking today I'm going to show you how to make the famous Korean Shelby short ribs and I have a slab of beef short rib with boned and also I have the sauce already make I will list the ingredients for you and also I have a processor food the processors with green onion onion garlic and asian peers okay I'm going to blend that and I'm gonna mix them with the sauce and marinate the ribs for overnight okay the next thing I'm going to pour this in on the top of the ribs I'm just gonna brush through really quick just like this and then I'm gonna pour the sauce over the ribs okay and then I'm gonna put in the fridge and I let them marinate for overnight or you can just do it like a 4 to 6 hours there's plenty time okay and at the Korean restaurant you can order a lot o like short ribs that usually come with the really thin slices and with the boned but this one I got is the whole slab alright okay I show you how to make it okay i marinate the short ribs overnight that's what they look like nice and happy ready to grow and I put my grill on medium and you can use a Pam or you can use butter for the short way butter is really tasty got a better flavor so I just like the Kota with the powder okay not much just like this and then you make sure your grill is like a medium heat okay and then you're just gonna put place the ribs one by one like this okay I usually put the meat side down first and the thought is so tasty is really good with the rice over with the rice so those what I'm gonna do okay and you want to grill about maybe four to five minutes on each side okay half to two minutes you get them a quick brush just like this let the sauce drizzle down to the bottom off the ribs was marrying it into the give them more flavor to the meat okay just like this okay after five minutes I check one piece it look really good the smell is so amazing right now you just give them a quick flip just like this okay just clip every one of them and then you give them a quick brush again here we go just like this okay and this time we're gonna cook to another five minutes okay after two minutes and get them a quick brush get the more flavor there we go and keeping the medium heat okay okay now it's done and what I usually do is I flip it one more time okay which is the meat side I turn over look how good they look whew and then what I did is the sauce you don't want to go to waste you just pull it the sauce in like this and now let the sauce nice and cooked temp the heat high and let the stock crumble nice nice and thick and you can use the sauce to pull over the rice it's still good like this okay this sauce is so good you don't want to go to waste all right what I did I just gonna wait until the sauce bring to a boil okay after a couple minutes the sauce is nice and thick it's ready to serve and the meat is not overcook because the five minutes on that side on the big side is literally just kind of like the medium-rare so now you got a more sauce caramelize and give the meat more flavor now we're ready to serve here is your delicious Korean Chloe short ribs my kids gonna love this I hope you liked the video I'm chef Tom thank you for watching fortune cooking please subscribe and comment I see you next time
