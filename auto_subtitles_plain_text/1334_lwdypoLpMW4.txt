 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and today alure in the kitchen I'm going to show you a wonderful recipe for one Italy's most classic soups it is pasta fagioli some people call it pasta fazool pasta fagioli same thing now different very different parts of Italy have their own way of making it this is the way I make it this is where my mother makes it all the women in my family this is how we make so here's what you're going to need I'm going to need three cans three 15 ounce cans of cannellini beans that I've already rinsed and drained we're going to use some celery some onions some tomato crushed tomatoes tomato puree whatever you have on hand some short cut pasta a couple cloves of garlic and you're also going to need some extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper it's just a couple of fresh basil leaves at the end to just really bring out the wonderful flavors of this magnificent sort of one-pot wonder of a meal now let's get the gist of and start cooking I have a big pan set preheating here with three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil I'm gonna add my onions and my celery like that saute for a few minutes do you want to bring out all the wonderful flavors and I want I don't want these to become caramelize I just want them to get tender now this is the way the pasta fagioli this is the way we make it in eight Naples so we don't use pancetta we don't use speck we don't use any kind of meat in it now if you go to different parts of Italy northern people usually put pancetta in theirs we don't and also you'll find that some people they swear by just making it red which means a lot of sauce it's going to really be red some people think that it should never be red it should be just white on ours just it's kind of in between it's like a pink has a pink hue to it it's not red it's not white but it's just delicious it's full of flavor and it is so inexpensive to make this used to be called poor people food because I mean what's cheaper than pasta and beans right but it's not it's I think it's one of the one of these one of the meals where it's a just brings you bring your family together it's comforting it's filling and it's delicious so we're going to cook these medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes you just want them to start cooking down but not caramelizing on Brown my onions and celery I've been cooking for about 5 minutes and as you can see they're not brown but they are softening that softened and all their beautiful flavors coming out and the aroma is just wonderful so now I'm going to add my two cloves of garlic and I'm not shopping or sauteing it for very long because I want mild flavor of the garlic I don't want a strong flavor so then I'm going to add my beans beautiful give these a wonderful little toss just like so this was a request some extra thrilled to be able to share it with you it's going to be wonderful wait till you see how wonderful it makes you have smell now we're going to add some water not not adding chicken stock I'm not adding vegetable stock I'm adding regular water because this is just the way we make it and that's the way I want to do it I do not want to set my mother and my grandmother here there we go now we're going to add in our tomato paste or tomato puree or whatever you have on hand that just happened to have some tomato puree but and as you can see it's it looks red but it's not it's actually pink and once it starts to cook down you add pasta you can really get nice and thick and delicious okay medium medium heat lid on 45 minutes check on it every 20 minutes or so to make sure nothing sticking and it's going to make your house smell delicious and then we're going to season it add the pasta in you're going to have a wonderful want pot meal they're going to be thankful for my steps been cooking for 45 minutes and it's just as it should be as you can see it's thickened really well this is going to be nice thick sort of almost like a stew butts just really nice and delicious I'm going to add my short cut past them using the Delaney you can use any kind of shortcut pasta at this point you want to live the lid off and we're going to season it as always I felt with a pepper and I do not know why I just do a little bit of pepper you want to season it well okay now like I said I used just some canned beans just because it's a little quicker and a little easier than to use the dry beans otherwise you'd have to soak them for a while you have to boil over three hours is too much so but in about an hour you have this delicious hearty one pot meal and it's so comforting and delicious and like I said it's easy easy perfect so let this go for another ten minutes because you want the pasta to cook well and then we can set it up soup is ready perfect just going to put a few basil leaves in there not much because I don't want to be just really like that aroma I want to be overpowering Oh perfect huh look at that it's thick it's delicious it's affordable and you don't need anything else with this well except I do think that it is necessary to have a very big chunk of crusty Italian bread it is necessary in my book then we clean my plate up a little
