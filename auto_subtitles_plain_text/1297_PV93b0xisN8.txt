 Mantello the Allrecipes member who submits this recipe writes it's hard to find a real Hungarian Goulash recipe this is the real thing and no tomato paste here try the serve with rustic bread or noodles to begin heat a large pot over medium heat add two tablespoons of lard or butter and allow to melt add in two finely sliced yellow onions and cook until the onions are translucent five to eight minutes stir in two pounds of beef chuck that we've cut into 1-inch cubes you can ask your butcher to cut the beef chuck for you also sprinkle in two tablespoons of a Hungarian paprika and reduce the heat to low allow the meat and onions to simmer stirring occasionally for one hour pour in one cup of water or beef stock like we are here adding more liquid as needed cook until the meat falls apart and the onion sauce is thick about 1 hour more and adjust the salt black pepper seasonings to your taste Allrecipes member Joey Jones has this to say about real Hungarian Goulash my house melts so wonderful while it was cooking my neighbors were leaning over the fence to get a whiff I'll be using this recipe often
