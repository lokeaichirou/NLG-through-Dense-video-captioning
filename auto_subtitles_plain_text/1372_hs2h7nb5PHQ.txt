 okay today's the day I'm finally going to show you my mom's New England clam chowder it's different than most it's pretty basic there's no bacon or corn this soup is so easy and so yummy I know you're going to fall in love with it so stick around and I'll show you how to make it okay the ingredients you will need are four cups diced potatoes two cups chopped celery two cups chopped onions and four cans of clams wait and I usually use two minced and two chopped just to get a variety clams you're going to need two pots to make this soup and in the first pot you're going to add your all your veggies in and you're going to open up your cans of clams and pour in their juice you can get a little strainer to get more juice out but I couldn't find my little strainer on this day so I'm doing it old-school pour all the juice in there and you might think at first that that's a not enough juice from the four cans but I promise you it will be once your vegetables start cooking they'll let off their juices and you'll have plenty so you can use frozen potatoes and it works really good in this chowder but not at this point and I'll show you later when you could add the frozen potatoes in and you're going to let these simmer until the potatoes are tender now let's grab our second pot to make the chowder you will need 1/2 cup of butter and I usually chop it up to put it in the pot just so it'll melt faster and then you will need a quart of half-and-half and then four cups of milk you can use whole milk but we have skim in our house the skin works fine the soup still thickens up really well so don't worry about that and then you'll need a cup of corn starch I know I add it in when all my milk is still very cold that way I don't get lumps from the corn starch okay you will need three teaspoons of salt and black pepper I just dust the top of it I don't measure it at all and then you'll need one teaspoon of sugar then you're going to whisk that up again you're going to keep whisking until it thickens up and you're not going to want to ignore the stove too much because you will scorch the bottom of your pan I used to do that a lot when I first started cooking this when I was in college you don't have to consistently stir book stir it quite often and it will thicken up on you once your veggies are done you're going to add them to your cream mixture and this is when you can add your frozen potatoes in it will just take a little bit longer to heat through and then you're going to add your clams so it doesn't take long for the clams to cook you just are heating them through basically so and if you do use frozen potatoes you might want to use your whole milk instead of the skim milk to help thicken it but it works really good I've done it and then I just taste test it with a plastic fork because for some reason a metal fork just makes the chowder seem saltier to me I don't know I'm weird so yeah and it's done you're basically just warming your clams and your chowder is done it's super fast you guys really quick and then we'll just play it up and chow down and I promise you you will absolutely love this chowder it's addicting it makes you really full one this batch is just a one batch and it feeds our family but if we are going to have company we usually double it and it makes a lot of soup but serve it up with your favorite rolls and you will be a happy camper seriously it was like one of the first meals I ever learned to cook for my mom and so in college I used to make chicken fingers ramen and clam chowder those are real tears that's hilarious I love oh goodness I can smell those onions from here holy cow my mom would make it for us did you know there's lots of listening going on on your face this chowder is so good it'll make you cry my eyes are burning they're on fire dang Gina
