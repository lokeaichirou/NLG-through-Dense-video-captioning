 living editor Nancy ironheart is joining me now to show us how to make a delicious BLT in today's between the bread okay Nancy so BLT very classic sandwich staple what makes this one different this one just for a little bit of extra creaminess uses feta cheese okay so other than feta cheese what else do we have in it well we obviously have bacon lettuce and tomato mm-hmm the basics basics a little bit of salt and pepper this feta and cream cheese mixture is also a little salt and pepper and two slices of multigrain bread okay and what's the first step to assembling this so the first step would be to toast the bread just really really lightly which I've already done here and then you're gonna take this feta cream cheese mixture and spread it liberally on to one of the slices of bread okay and this is just equal parts feta and cream cheese with a little bit of salt and pepper for seasoning and just mix together yeah just mix together to the fork very simple and very delicious and now would you serve it cold or what you heat it up yeah if I actually were doing this at my home kitchen I would just pop this slice into the oven for just a few minutes just long enough to kind of warm the cheese but not make it too melty okay and now what comes after the cheese after the cheese is the beautiful tomatoes we have here and not tomatoes are in season right yes they're in season right now and I really just won't even waste my time making a BLT unless it's summertime because they are just so good and they're gonna be the star of this sandwich and don't be afraid if they kind of hang over a little bit okay and then after that we've got our bacon okay and for the bacon do you put it in a pan do you put in the oven and how do you prepare well you can cook it however you prefer I like to cook in the oven but today I actually cooked it in the microwave because it's so hot out and I didn't want to turn on the oven it's about five minutes in the microwave and it turns out really crispy and delicious so use about three pieces of bacon is a good for one sandwich okay unless you really love bacon right you can put more it's really fine and then we're gonna put a little bit of romaine lettuce just for some extra crispy crunch yeah you know make you feel like you're eating something healthy yeah as you said there's a reason this is a favorite yes I mean all these flavors together are just credible and then you know you want to just do a little bit of salt and pepper to kind of give the tomatoes bring out some of the flavor in the tomatoes and I actually like to add salt and pepper to all of my sandwiches and then we'll put the last slice of bread here mm-hmm and then slice it in half that's a big sandwich well the lettuce makes it very voluminous but I think that it really helps the crispness of it so here I'll let you have it sliced I'm gonna go and see yeah let me know what you think and now what was sort of the inspiration for you to try this well I feel like a lot of restaurants now are putting avocados on our BLTs which I really love but this was actually inspired by a Spanish top of it uses a goat cheese bacon and tomato so it's got a little Spanish influence and do you find that you're seeing be able to use in more menus or yeah I feel like I'm seeing BLTs with lots of different variety you know they've got a fried egg on them or they've got an avocado on them I mean really as long as you have these three ingredients to start you can really do all kinds of variations on it and it's always delicious well I love the cheese I think it complements everything really well thank you yeah it's not too decadent actually okay seems like it would be perfect to me thank you thank you thanks so much Nancy thanks for having me
