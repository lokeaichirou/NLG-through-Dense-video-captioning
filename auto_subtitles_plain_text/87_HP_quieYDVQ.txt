 my mom and dad obviously Italian and they migrated to Australia in the mid-70s my mum she was eight months pregnant with myself and so I was born born in Australia and I'm very proud to be Australian so I was running Patriot since I was you know nineteen years old I started my first patreon Melbourne and I decided I wanted to venture off into more the traditional style Peter which is you know would fire Peter so I traveled over to to Naples did a course there with the Veda Pizza Napoletana which is the true Napolitan traditional Peter I decided to do that course because they were the only Association that actually looked at preserving and keeping the tradition alive around the world and then I came back opened up 400 bloody it so we're you know one of four hundred restaurants in the world that is accredited to produce Napolitan style Peter the Italian world Pizza competition is in Italy they do have another one in Las Vegas the one in Italy is the biggest in the world there are 20 different judges on a panel and there's also four different judges at the bench and each one is judging on different techniques so cleansiness up in preparation the manipulation of how you stretch your your pizza the cooking time every person has a responsibility so it is a really strict competition the event consists of six hundred competitors 35 countries around the world the early Australians ever of won the competition I went into the competition not doing anything different to what I do every day you know in my restaurant in Brunswick I made my dough by hand I also crushed all my tomatoes by hand as well I found the the best platform at Sorella which was DOP I also used one of the best flowers in the world that I bring into the country make my pizza everyday using also bottled water which made a big difference as well and obviously my levitation odd my dough was very natural no refrigeration and you know I went in there again and and just did the same thing that I do every day and and it was a great result okay so I'm going to show you how to make a world-class margarita pizza now a lot of people actually think that margarita beats is one of the easiest pizzas to produce well let me tell you it's actually one of the hottest feeds that are produced because you're only using four four ingredients so it's really hard to mask if your dough hasn't been produced right and if you're not using high quality ingredients the reason is that we try and entrap all the gasses all the air into the dough so we create a nice Courtney shawnee which is the crust we're not going to use any rolling pins as a lot of people do at home we're going to use only our hands with practice you are obviously going to get better at it we starting in from the bottom all the way to the top and we flip the pizza over repeat the process again and use from the bottom all the way to about an inch from the top the next step is we place our right hand on one side if your right hand if you're left-handed the opposite so right hand on one side and again away from the crust - away from the pudding showing it and with our left hand we then stretch and we come over to our forearm and we hold it there and we go back down and so if you do this in a normal speed you'll find that you will get this motion and now we're ready to use the ingredients so what I've done is I've sourced some of the best ingredients that I can find and that's sad maternal tomato place it in the center of the pizza and then we spread the tomato and again leaving that 1 inch border all the way around the reason why we do that is so that when the pizza cooks the the Gordon Shawn it is going to rise in the oven it's going to become nice and light a lot of people leave the crust with bits and Apple Adana the crust is actually one of the most important parts of the Pete and I say that because the crust actually helps you digest the rest of the pita I'm going to use buffalo mozzarella tear the buffalo mozzarella into small pieces and just place it around the pizza quite evenly fresh basil and to finish off I'm going to top this pizza with some extra virgin olive oil now the pizza's ready to go into the oven if you don't have a wood fire oven at home this is actually the next best thing to cook your pizzeria and I want to show you this this oven is actually a stone based on suits it's nearly the same as cooking in in a wood fire oven now one thing about the stone a lot of people go wrong is what they do is they try and wash the stone you can either just brush it down or wipe it down with with a cloth or or with a brush into your next pizza so don't please don't wash your stone now the settings on the oven are quite important now depending on what style of pizza that you're going to make is the type of setting that you want to choose so I chosen the classic setting that way we get an even distribution on the top and also on the bottom and the beautiful thing about this omen is that you can actually look through this window not having to open and close the oven frequently by opening and closing you're actually letting the heat out so try and monitor it through the window and you know within three or four minutes your pizza should be cooked and I think our pizzas pretty much ready to take out of the oven so as you can see these pts actually cooked quite well in its Scott spotting like like it's come out of a wood fire oven where it it cut these pits are up and enjoy it
