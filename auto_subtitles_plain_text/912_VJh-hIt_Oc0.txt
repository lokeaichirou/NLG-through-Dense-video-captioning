 hey everybody this is Dave from cook and chair and today we're making up one of everybody's all-time favorite fast foods sliders these mini burgers are simple delicious packed with flavor I know you're gonna want to make them so let's get started well what I have here is about a pound of lean ground beef so to make the patties I'm gonna add about half a cup of breadcrumbs to it a small chopped onion now you want this chopper really really fine an egg a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce about half a teaspoon of salt another 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper a couple of cloves of crushed garlic four or five drops of Tabasco sauce now you can leave this out but I find it just gives it a little extra kick and I'm just gonna take my spatula here and begin mixing this together then I'm gonna switch to my hands just to make sure everything is really well combined now that I've got everything nicely combined I'm gonna scoop up a small handful and form a patty that's about oh I'd say three inches in diameter but this really depends on the size of your bun so you kind of have to eyeball your buns while you're making your patties and we'll set these aside on a plate and repeat the process for the rest of the mixture actually I should mention that these really freeze nicely so what you could do is you could make a bunch up put them in the freezer and use them another day okay I've got my charcoal grill nice and hot here of course you can use an electric grill a gas grill or even a frying pan so I'm just gonna slip my slider patties on in my case I'm gonna cook them for about seven or eight minutes on each side it really depends on your grill so just keep an eye on them and make sure they're cooked through well the burgers are grilling don't forget to click that subscribe button and never miss a video if you have a recipe you'd like us to cook drop us a line below oh now the burger patties are nicely done and cooked through I'm gonna remove them from the grill and slip them on to a toasted dinner roll now this is the way I build my slider of course it's entirely up to you how you build yours but I'm gonna start by grating some cheddar cheese over top of the patty followed by a slice of tomato onion some lettuce what a my all-time favorites yellow mustard the ketchup and last but not least relish now I'm simply gonna slip the top on put a toothpick in the center just to hold it together and you're ready to dig in and there you have it our easy tasty and juicy sliders believe me these mini burgers have a huge flavor and make a great party idea so let's have a party head on over to cook and cheer calm for this recipe and many more easy recipes don't forget to click to subscribe and like our videos thanks for watching and see you next time you
