 today on tap Gallup II Korean barbeque this is Alan with the growing network let's get cooking here we have roughly five pounds of beef short rib that I purchased from my local butcher I had them slice it 1/4 inch thick I took the liberty of pre washing them to remove any residual bone fragments let's go ahead and start on the marinade for this marinade we're going to use one Korean pear peeled and minced if you can't find a Korean pear in your local grocery store you can definitely use a standard pair just do the same thing peel it and slice it we're gonna use a half a minced onion to this we're going to add 8 cloves of garlic minced I love garlic to that we'll add a finger of ginger I went ahead and julienned and then minced it to that we're adding a green onion I'll cap actually 3 green onions just sliced up to this were adding 1/2 cup of soy sauce we're adding rice wine 2 tablespoons of sesame oil some brown sugar I'll go ahead and add the exact ingredients below and for a little bit of heat we're adding some chili paste now that we have our marinade put together just add the beef you can either marinate it overnight in your refrigerator or do what I do I use my back master fraiche chamber sealer and wrap it and fuse it one of the views of using a chamber sealer as the ability to wrap and infuse flavors what normally takes you hours in the refrigerator takes me minutes in my vacuum chamber now that we have that perfect seal let's place it inside the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and we'll meet you outside at the grill all right it's time to get these bad boys on the grill we've preheated our grill to a medium heat you want to be careful the marinade has got some sugar in it and that you don't want to overcook and burn these ribs we're looking at two to three minutes per side it's been a little over three minutes let's go ahead and put these bad boys over as you can see we've got a nice grill marks just want to make sure that they don't burn well we'll let these go for another three minutes and we'll meet you back inside as you see here we have our galibi or Korean barbecue plate it up we have some rice and Korean barbecue wouldn't be complete without some kimchi let's go ahead and give this a try a cool trick that I learned was to get between the bones you just take a pair of scissors and you cut and there you go wow that was totally phenomenal Korean barbecue has a slight sweetness flavor to it that's why I added the chili sauce that took it to another level and how do you recommend it again I want to thank you for stopping by if you have any comments make sure you leave them below make sure you subscribe if you haven't already done so and we'll see you on the next one you
