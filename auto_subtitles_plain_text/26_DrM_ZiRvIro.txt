 hey guys welcome to Hilah cooking don't you just love corndogs I do today we're going to make homemade corn dogs with homemade batter and we're gonna homemade frying and our homemade deep fryer it's actually a deep breath that I bought but anyway let's do it [Music] alright I'm Cymbeline the batter in here I have cornmeal flour baking soda big and salt wait baking salt baking powder and salt and then I'm mixing my wet ingredients here the recipe calls for buttermilk but I didn't have any because I screwed up I'm sorry but I put regular milk in and just added like a teaspoon of vinegar voila buttermilk now I'm gonna grate third of a cup of onion okay so I'm gonna use a microplane because I like it super little but if you want little chunks you could use a bigger grater or you can dice it with your knife or you could put it in the blender or you could put it in a bag maybe and then hit it with a hammer a bunch and pulverize it like a Hulk would you I don't know how effective that would be but it might be fun now this is not going to be 1/3 of a cup by the time I'm done because it's so amazingly mashed but that's ok because I know that that hunk of onion that I cut off was about a third of a cup worth of onion and volume so we'll still get the same amount of onions believer ok whatever put that in with my homemade buttermilk and I'm crying because it's so good get that little bit in there and then 8 ounces of this this is a 14 ounce can so that means just a little bit more than half the can I think you guys tell me if I'm wrong cuz math was not my strong subject just kidding I was pretty good at math okay just combine that together and then we'll pour this into our big bowl of dry ingredients and whisk it together to combine you sound gross here I go now you don't know mix it too much if there's still some lumps that's ok just get all the dry stuff from the bottom ok this looks good and the set it aside to rest while my oil heats up in that 10 minutes the corn cornmeal is going to absorb the liquid the batter's gonna really thicken up a lot so it's very important for thickening and also just soften the cornmeal granule so you don't get real gritty batter if it's too thick when you're done you can add a little bit more milk but we'll we'll check out that out and right now I'm going to get some dogs on some sticks and get some oil hot yeah yeah ok we ready to make some corn dogs I got my fry daddy I got a bunch of shortening I'm gonna put in here you can use peanut oil but I personally like shortening because it's easier to clean up and also I love trans fats and heart disease just kidding I whatever it's once a year I'm not going to kill myself this way probably not um this Friday day that I have only has one heat temperature on and I have no I lost the manual so I don't know what temperature it fries at but um fries to golden-brown temperature that's what I'm talking about so this whole thing goes in here alright and put some paper down because I don't want to get oil all over my fancy countertops that I just bought so you could put it up normally I put an old towel down but I don't know where that old towel went that's clean who wants to lick the canister ok I'm going to plug this baby in like so and that's going to start heating up right away and in the meantime I have my dogs and I have them on a plate of cornmeal our corn starch and that's important because that's going to help the batter stick to them so you just want to like roll them around the cornstarch and and then stab them with the stick like they're vampire and then stick this gently gently do not want to puncture the sidewalls of the hotdogs just keep it going straight and easy just easing it in just easing it in easing it in you should look at your hot dog when you're doing this but I'm a pro so I can look at the camera and do it okay all right I'm gonna do a couple of these while that well heats up it's already melting real good last insertion I should be a wiener surgeon okay I'm just gonna get these all covered in my um stuff oh I lied a little bit too this is actually sweet rice flour because I ran out of cornmeal but usually it's cornmeal but I've tried this before too and it works so give me a break either way I don't really know what else to do a sweet rice flour besides uses to make American corn dogs I'm gonna rinse my hands that's heating up I'm gonna check the actually F rinsing my hands I love Maine II juice on my hands I'm gonna check the consistency alright this might be a team at sake but actually as I stirred it's loosening up a little bit so I'm gonna not add any milk for now and try one and if the batter falls off then somebody else has to eat that one alright I remembered that I have a deep fry thermometer so get your oil hot to a 375 this is 370 but it's been at that for a while so I give up close enough all right I'm gonna dip a dog so put it in like that and then use a spoon to sort of scoop the batter give it a little twirl get it totally coated all right I put a little spin and then put it in there just twirl it around in there and see it's already getting nice and golden-brown and it gets real lumpy not going to look like the ones that you get at the State Fair but it's going to taste a hundred times better okay apparently I have absolutely no sense of time because it's been one minute and that looks pretty beautifully Brown to me so I'm gonna set it on that paper to drain them for a second and it's fun because you can imagine what kinds of weird shapes and faces are in your Lumpy's that kind of looks like boobs all over it to me a bunch of boobs okay perfect now I'm going to eat this one that's been cooling for a little while dip in my secret sauce I love corn dogs mmm be careful if you give this to a small child because there's a stabby part in it so let's learn kids be careful when you eat mmm you can make a rum corn dogs because this is merica okay I'm going to finish eating my corn dog but if you want the actual written down instructions you can check out Hilah cooking calm and leave me some comments stuff and be my fan on Facebook and then we'll be BFF
