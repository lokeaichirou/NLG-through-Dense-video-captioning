 hi everyone today I'm going to show you how to make the Vietnamese crispy spring roll but in a version that you might not have known before that is the version of Graham going from central Vietnam and like name in Hanoi or cha-cha in Saigon rambling is a lot more simple but to me is the greatest ring roll of all Kai's so give it a try some day and I'm sure that you will like it the ingredients are simple you just need trims pork spring onion and some one spring roll wrappers firstly we prepare the feelings we use shrooms with the skin on because at the differing it will make our rose even more crispy we just remark the tip of the head the end of the tail and the legs so that it won't hurt your mouth when you eat next we cut the pork into very thin slices and mix our one spring onion stem to season our pork together with some salt and pepper if you cut the pork too thick you have to stir-fry them before rolling otherwise when we do fry the spring roll is burned before the meat is cooked if you know what I mean we also season arrows rooms with some salt and pepper now we cut the spring onion into two inches long and tear the stem into long strips with the tip of a knife at the spring area and I bought today is quite big and callate on the green part too now we start a Lampur our spin bros you can use more size spring roll pastry wrapper or writes paper the spring roll pastry is sold in the package like this at the Asian supermarket under frozen section and you need to defrost them under room temperature before rolling carefully remove one wrapper and place on a flat surface then place one shroom one slice of pork and some spring onion at the corner of the wrapper you roll it diagonally and starting from the corner stop halfway and fold the both sides in would then continue to roll very tightly until the end you can seal it with some egg white as a glue once again the feelings at the corner and rolling halfway then fold both sides in and continue to roll you can make many rolls at one time and store them in the freezer for several meals if you rise paper you live in warm water and check out the excess water you let it soften about 20 seconds and place some feelings on top same thing okay so your roll halfway and fro both sides inward then continue to roll up very tightly it's important that you'd roll tight enough otherwise the feelings will fall off when you deep fry them now we hit a generous amount of oil and use our chapstick to test the error if bubbles come up meaning is hot enough gently place the rose into the pan leaving some space between the rose during the first few minutes so that they wanted to each other after that it's okay to stock more into a pair of Mohammad saw we just fry them until they turn golden brown and place on a table tower to drain off the SS order you going gonzo good ball long time away if you use rice paper and fry many in the pan the final products might not look at nice but this Duty is great no problem and I want to make some restaurant like spring roll today so I fried some spring roll with spring roll pastry wrapper and using a mini deep fryer and fry them under hundred fifty degrees Celsius so the products came out perfectly after a few minutes you can serve the Springboro along as the starter or a snack together with some dipping sauce or you can wrap them in leather leaves he am gonna wrap it in fresh green mustard leaf and it is called Rambo guy goodbye on you never gay guy gun bye oh my god is really yummy it's very very crispy and has an amazing fragrance of fries room and fresh banana and nine bones you can also serve with some rice vermicelli and fresh greens together with some light to be sauce in there I'm good that's okay I'm gotta go eat now I cannot wait anymore thank you for watching in my body I'm going outside
