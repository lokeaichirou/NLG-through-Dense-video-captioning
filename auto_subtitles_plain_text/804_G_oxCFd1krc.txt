 look at all these Tomatoes what am I gonna do with them all I have an idea I'm gonna make soup today's soup is really delicious and a little bit different because it's a roasted tomato soup so delicious cut four pounds of plum tomatoes in half I like to use the plum here because they have less liquid in them so the soup will end up thicker and a little richer but I suppose you could use regular tomatoes and then just cook them down a little more up to you to intensify the flavor roast the tomatoes and I'm going to roast them with some garlic and some onions get everything nice and sort of cook down a little bit before I simmer it with my stock two medium onions dice them up they don't need to be too fine because the soups gonna be pureed later but not too chunky either let's agree on 1/2 inch three quarters of an inch maybe like the way I'm making you part of the process don't you feel good it's amazing how onions really add so much sweetness to things when they cook down right they're so sharp and bright when they're raw and they're so sweet and delicious when they're cooked I just love that three cloves of garlic they don't even really need to be smashed by I'm going to smash them down just a little bit release some of their aroma and then everything goes onto the baking sheet with the tomatoes just get them down in there with the tomatoes it doesn't matter if the sheet pan is crowded the juices will sort of gather in there and then they go into the soup pot anyway so normally I like to spread things out if I want a lot of caramelization here I'm not looking for tons of caramelization just a tiny bit drizzle with a quarter cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper you can season again later when you puree the soup together have your oven preheating to 450 degrees and what you want to do is roast your tomatoes and onions until the tomatoes are dark brown in spots let's take about 35 or 40 minutes after 35 40 minutes the tomatoes should be done all right see how they've gotten kind of wrinkled and they're starting to get brown in spots now they're ready to cook even further into a soup just scrape them into a large Dutch oven this is what you were building flavor here a kind of flavor that you wouldn't really get if you just simmered them from the beginning make sure you get all the pan juices into your pot all right and then to that add four cups of chicken broth you can use homemade if you have it that's always better you'll probably need a little more salt if you do that when the soup comes to a boil you want to turn it down to a simmer and then let it cook uncovered until it's slightly reduced and the tomatoes are really nice and soft when the soup is simmered for twenty-five minutes it's time to puree it I'm gonna use an immersion blender because I have one and I really like using them if you don't have an immersion blender you use a regular blender but make sure that you only fill it about a third of the way and then cover the top with because liquid expands and it can be the great thing about emerging blender is no splatter basically no mess these kind come apart so they're really alive hmm really sweet from all that roastin so I think it needs a little bit more salt I said I didn't want more pepper but I do want more pepper there's not a lot of seasonings in here so you want to make it really fault flavored with what you have I think sprinkling a little basil over the top at the end as a garnish is nice or you can stir it all in and flavor of the whole soup so delicious it's like summer in a bowl that's why I like to freeze it for later so that I can experience some are all over again in the winter mm-hmm know what I mean I do not like to let go I don't know about you but summer is my favorite season and I like to eat as if it were summer all year long make this soup and you're gonna be able to give it a little drizzle of olive oil and enjoy your summer tomato soup freeze some keep it for later or why not chill this and serve it cold I bet that would be delicious hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this
