 hey guys chef Jason Hill here and I'm with Jax Galvani from the cooking with Jack show Jack on the go burger wars how many channels you got on YouTube now a bunch cool and cool cool right now we're on chef tips yes Ron chef tips and I'm going to show Jack how to make the Juicy Lucy burger and there's a couple of different ways you can do it that's gonna do it a more traditional way with our classic American cheese I'm gonna do a little gourmet version with some fresh buffalo mozzarella so let's get started all right we got about a pound of ground beef each and it's 80/20 so that means it's a little bit more fat than your lean ground beef but it just makes it taste better yeah yeah I mean you can't if you're gonna do a burger see people say I'm fat it just makes me taste better I don't know what their problem is but I think if you're going to do a really good burger you've got to have a little bit of the fat in there to get that flavor so what I'm going to start with jack is I'm gonna go ahead and start forming one patty and you can grab maybe a third of this pound that you got going third of it and try and just flatten it out as thin as possible that Gator anymore that's probably good right there yeah yeah all right so let's go ahead and get that on your cutting board and just flatten it out shape it up and do a round patty and we want to go a little big on these because these are going to shrink up on the grill because of the fat content they're gonna shrinking you know you don't want to open up your bun and go where's the beef so we want them nice and big so they fit right on the bun oh yeah how did you Pat it out your patty yeah exactly okay so you want to grab about the same amount that you did before maybe not quite as much and make another patty so the smaller one's gonna be our kind of our lid yeah then we're gonna seal the edges okay at this point I like to take a little kosher salt sprinkle from the heavens a little pinch on each one oh nice you go to church to cool yes and then we're gonna hit it with some fresh cracked pepper I can't say enough about this home.this of rice your grinder yeah I love this thing dude and I can't remember where my wife got of course okay because you don't want me getting one oh yeah I know how chefs are thinking real weird my secret secrets exactly so it's probably best that I break these in for ya break them up a little bit overlap them keep them in the centers best as possible you don't want the cheese to is out on the sides when we're cooking no no all right like that yeah if you want more feel free to whatever you think you know if you want to put another slice in there go for it all right I'm good at this get your pieces there all right here we go like that nice get this press mozzarella in here yours looks better ha ha I got a I got a you know up stage a little bit now let's take your seasoned side and put it down over the cheese mm-hmm and now we're gonna seal this guy up just kind of pinch the edges because like I said if you lose all your cheese during the cooking then we just mess the whole thing exactly if you mean kids can really do this oh yeah art class and then finally I just like to season the top for the little more salt just a little bit a little more pepper nice and anybody can change any of these steps like eight different seasonings right oh yeah whatever you like to season your burgers with I mean you know if you want you know any seasoned salt that you prefer any cheesy before any bleu cheese would be awesome in this thing yeah jalapeno you put in there yes yeah that'll be beautiful okay Jack we're gonna do these on the grill you can do these on your stovetop in a pan if you want I'm scanning in snow yeah I haven't shoveled my deck yet sorry about that what's the first time I've ever barbecued in the snow isn't it cool it's crazy we'll make a snowman afterwards too yeah okay for my burger I'm gonna go ahead and put these tomatoes on and I have a video already on these grilled tomatoes you can check the link there if you want to recipe they're all marinated look at them yeah balsamic vinegar olive oil oh my gosh basil everything I love about the in Italian garlic shallot puree yay I got the grill on high and I like to cook the burgers to medium come on get off there hi cousin wanna go-o-o and also let's go ahead and put some onions on here oh and I grilled onions yeah oh dude I love everything if it's not moving I'll eat it just put a little olive oil on those okay they've been on here for a couple minutes I'm gonna go ahead and give them a quarter turn so far our cheese is staying inside that's what we wanted all right now I'm going to turn them after about three minutes on each side look at that ah Oh am i starting to come apart a little bit ah that's alright as long as the cheese doesn't come out oh look at that it looks beautiful dude that looks nice nice work well thanks for your correction we're almost done I'm gonna close the lid look at that pretty much close to medium if these nice and charred Ramos ready look at that and yeah I keep them up side most of the time and then right before I pull them off I took flip them over and just get that other side nice and closing that's some fat burgers dude yeah I mean fat burger aren't that big you got a figure you got a lot cheese in there that's puffing them up too so Wow okay Jack what's build these burgers all right man it smells great I've got some garlic mayo that I made up with just roasted garlic blend it into some plain old
