 hi and welcome to the video on how to make some pureed muscles the great dishes that in a spicy I'm going to show you how we make those right away for those you will need a round of pound of mussels some a little bit of onion the quarter of a chopped red pepper some celery little bit of garlic and some carrot I'm going to check all that here i'm going to process it to a food processor to do some kind of little sofrito i'm also going to use some curry powder cilantro a little white wine and any cream like two tablespoon of white wine here and 3 tbsp of every cream okay so first thing first I'm going to process that to my Robo coupe to just chop everything so I just chop make mine a sofrito here with my carrot onion celery garlic red pepper I don't want to pay star I wanted to do to be chunky okay because that's important after it's going to give texture to my dish one thing i want to mention too i forgot to talk about that muscles it's very important that your muscles are very fresh if you see any open muscles here like this one it's open but if it doesn't close by that muscle might be dead and you don't want to use it so if it closed back it's alive this one is just closing back right on you here see what happened it must so get cold and as I get cold they open up in my finger here they kind of warm up and it'll be done close see but my soldiers clothes back I have another one let's see the same thing happen said I put it in my hand like that see I it's closing back which is a little cold also all those muscles are clean but there's one thing here see that in a string that's the beard of a muscle you want to remove that to remove it you just put it off like that now no one thing after your move that Bert that beer the muscle will die and you want to make sure you cook them right after huh so I check the other one before and I know that they are clean and alive I tricked that feat of beer right here whoopsie ok so now but you know about that we're going to prove it also sometimes they open what you can do you try to find another one that's open that one is open right here you see it's open I'm going to take it I'm going to bang it a little bit like that and see it's closing bad that's another way to see you very close back to ok so am I so deep on here I'm going to first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to saut√© my sofrito in a bit of oil I just realized I've too much i'm just going to use half of it that ok I pour it over here half tablespoon is enough I'm going to a warm up and then I'm going to add my mixed vegetable here the cilantro right here I'm going to chop it costly and add it at the end to the muscles okay here we go I don't want to pawn too hot because I don't want to really give any cut off to those vegetable when making muscles I will season it at the end because muscles are a little salty on they own and before I put salt I want to check the seasoning when I'm done and then i'd see if it needs some salt on it okay I got one here i'm going to add some of my career I made that own career here its a mix of spices depending how spicy you want it you know you just put it it as much you think you you like yeah like it pretty spicy Larry cook it in a bit not too long now I'm going to add my white wine okay and then my muscles okay now a bit of the crib huh literally mr. and I'm going to cover it with a lid we're going to steam those muscles you can see the reflection of the coming out here great now so as I cool them I'm going to shake them a little bit the help for them to open up when it's cooking I'm going on the side here to chop my cilantro cilantro is one of those herb it's okay to use the stems from them because there's a lot of flavor in them and they're very tender they started to open up Sita that one is done already run away for all of them to be fully fully open let's check now okay look at that they are nicely open ok so now i'm going to remove them into my boy here and then i will reduce the sauce a little bit more okay so I we're removing been completely upper is our nice mysore great size here from ok okay i'm going to add the cilantro at that point going to test it wow this is good showing this week those are great in engineering so I'm adding a little salt testing it again so good now to finish this dish up what I'm going to do is just add that juice all over the Masters this way and now you have a great feast here guys okay career in my soul thank you for watching if you liked the recipe give it one of those okay you could even subscribe to my channel what do you think let's give it a shot president subscribe button please thank you very much
