 hello there welcome back to the once a week kitchen today I've decided to do bangers and mash with a super-duper onion sauce in the pan I've got two kilos of potatoes and a teaspoon full of salt I've covered them in cold water bringing them to the bile and then I will bail them for about 20 minutes until they're soft meanwhile I'm going to cook the bangers great sausages in the frying pan I'm cooking these on quite a long gas don't want them to brown real quickly and that's all just keep turning them until they're well done all of that while the potatoes are boiling for the mash meanwhile I want to make onion sauce to go with their bangers and mash right on the in sauce this is delicious it's wonderful with bangers and mash but you can have it with other meals as well what are we fancy basic white sauce really I don't mean say so got an ounce of butter in the pan we do it slightly differently with it being on you so so when to melt right I've got 4 ounces of finely chopped onions announcer plain flour a teaspoon full of 1/2 a teaspoon each of salt and pepper take about maybe three quarters of a pint of milk so in the pan and what we're going to do we're going to saute the onions gently so that this often but I don't want them to brown so that they go sort of clear and soft but not not turned brown and crispy at all so the butcher is melting in the pan now so I'm going to pop in the onions right the onions are sizzling gently now I just want to sweat this for about five minutes over low heat and the plain flour what we want is for the flour to cook at least 30 seconds but seeing as it's all over the onions that we'll leave it to minutes we don't want the tip the soft taste flour we all right just little aware that four minutes it's important to do that if you don't your wits itself sweetest flower once you start having a milk now you keep staring it this should be any will send the sauce really loves the camera then so I'm going to keep staring them too little to the violin chickens itself is just going to boil now and it's very sick it's not until you get it to the boil that you can tell what consistency it is so at this stage I'm going to add some more milk so I want it to fall over the bangers and mash thickens but not too thick you'll get to know how you'll like it when you make some you silly just needs to see my per minute and that's it then the self system my feeling so close now and the bangers are doing very well so I'm going to swap the detector on friend of mine called Nick called the chef so that the best way to do this is with an electric mixer I can never be bothered to get the mixer out and with this that's all you need to watch like my sausage is very black so there's not a mistake nice portion of lovely mash gorgeous I'm a petite see you later
