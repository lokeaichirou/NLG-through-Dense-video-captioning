 [Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with my recipe for buttermilk fried chicken one of my favorite recipes of all time and not that hard to put together and just for fun i'm gonna show you how i break down a whole chicken for fried chicken i'm gonna take off the wingtips those are useless i'm gonna DJ the wings right with they attach to the body alright the thigh leg section comes off don't be afraid to snap and dislocate and then that gets caught between the drumstick and the thigh yes this is quick but go back and watch it you know seven or eight times you'll see so once the legs and thighs are done i'm left with basically the carcass which has the backbone and the breasts and you'll notice i'm using a nice heavy cleaver the ultimate tool for a chicken breakdown snap the backbone like that cut the breasts in half and then each breast gets cut in two pieces alright you'll notice here when i cut the breast in half i sliced down until i hit the bone and then i give it one pound with my hand so it goes through in one shot nice and clean otherwise you get like bone fragments so there's my four breast pieces my two thighs drumsticks and the two wings all right into the ball goes black pepper salt paprika dried herbs white pepper cayenne and that gets tossed all the believe it or not eleven herbs and spices will be on this site okay after that's well tossed with these spices and herbs you're gonna top it with buttermilk and we're gonna let that sit for six hours you can get away with four you can go overnight if you want but i like six hours alright then we're gonna make some seasoned flour which is just flour salt some paprika some cayenne some garlic powder some white pepper and some onion powder so give that a mix after the buttermilk marination the chicken pieces get dredged oh my god there's a fire truck going by hate when that happens the chicken gets dredged in that seasoned flour well there you want it really nicely coated give it a little shake off put on a plate and then we're ready to fry and what we're gonna do and there's lots of different ways to fry this i'm going to take a Dutch oven alright that's a big 8 quart Dutch oven and I have about two and a half quarts of oil in there and I'm gonna fry all eight pieces at once now some people like to fry in a skillet and just like an inch or two of oil and then they do it in batches and they turn it halfway through you know I don't have the patience I want it to all be done at the same time of course this uses twice the oil but you know what how often do you make fried chicken like once a year so at 350 I'm gonna cook that for about 10 minutes it's gonna develop a nice crust I'm gonna go in after 10 minutes and just move it around a little just in case some pieces are stuck together and I want to cook evenly that's gonna go for about another 10 to 15 minutes so it's about 20-25 minutes total in the hot oil to cook all the way through now while that's finishing up I like to take a rack and put it on some paper towels on a sheet pan and that's what I'm gonna use to drain the cooked chicken on all right so that's ready and the chickens ready look at that unbelievably beautiful so again it's been about 20 to 25 minutes total in the oil I'm gonna fish it out with my spider that little strainer thing you see there and what beautiful chicken impossibly crispy amazingly delicious don't bite into it for about 10 minutes because it's so hot you won't enjoy it you just burn yourself so 10 minutes later we had a delicious plate of fried chicken and I just could not bring myself to eat this in front of you but trust me it was every bit as good as it looks that is not a hard recipe it does take a little bit of work but completely worth it so like I said 11 herbs and spices blued or not or what was included in this you can go to the site count them yourself as all the ingredients are listed there and as always enjoy you
