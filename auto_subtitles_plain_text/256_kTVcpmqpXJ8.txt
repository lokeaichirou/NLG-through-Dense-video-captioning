 my version of fast food at home is Japanese Budo noodle soup and he used futon noodles found in the Asian market in the federated section these are already cooked and this recipe is from Cat Cora you'll need Buddha noodles or any type of noodles or dried pasta that you have broth miso paste and I used a combination of Japanese mushrooms snow peas carrots and green onions so these are Japanese udon noodles they're wheat based their thick they've got a great chew to them I love that they're thick and love the texture of them and these are already cooked so you'll find these in the Asian refrigerated section you can also find them dry as well but I like these because it just takes a few seconds in hot water to get them ready I always recommend cooking your noodles or your pasta in a separate pot of hot water not your precious soup because you can see it releases cooking the noodles releases some starch and you don't want that in your broth okay this is miso paste this particular one is sheera miso which is white me saw it is the mildest of all miso it's mild in terms of saltiness and intensity of flavor this is the one that I always have in my refrigerator at home and it lasts for quite a while in the refrigerator it lasts for about six months in the fridge okay I've got some chicken broth already going in this pot add my vegetables carrots I have snow peas as well and you can use any type of vegetables you want just keep them very thinly sliced so they cook really quickly there goes my snow peas and then I'm also going to add some Japanese mushrooms as well to this pot you can use shiitake you can use these are shimeji mushrooms but anything really works here's a trick to working with me so you don't want to boil the miso so what I do is I ladle some hot soup into a bowl with a miso paste and then what I'm going to do is use a whisk and whisk until everything's kind of the miso paste is kind of melted in with the hot soup just like this and then I'm going to take that and add it to the pot and notice that my heat is off you don't really want to boil the me saw because it when you boil me so it just kind of gives it a gritty texture so this is a tip you now I'm going to add the noodles in and just kind of swirl it around to let it heat up and my green onions and it's done start to finish less than 15 minutes and you've got a beautiful healthy warming ode on me so noodle soup
