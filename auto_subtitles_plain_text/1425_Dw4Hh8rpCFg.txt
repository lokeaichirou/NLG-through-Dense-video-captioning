 hey welcome to the green apple home so today I'm making this yummy apple salad that I sometimes do around the holidays and I can't find the recipe so I'm just gonna wing it most of it you kind of eyeball anyways because it's kind of like potato salad some people like it more mayonnaise II some people don't so I'm just going to tell you how I usually do it and if I find the recipe all officially write it down in the description maybe but anyways no big deal I usually do about four apples I did five apples just because when Annapolis was like teeny-tiny you want to do I do green and red so I've got two granny smith apples and three they're actually Rome apples but Red Delicious would work I add a half cup of mayonnaise and you may want to start out with a quarter cup just to see I don't like it really man easy some people may even want it more than half a cup but you're going to add a half a cup of that to your apples so right now I just have them cored if if you don't have a core oh my goodness what are you missing out on these are so cheap and you've got to get one and just like cores your apples so nicely and I only I have to do it's hard browning man I just did this like two seconds ago I was in they all have to do is chop these into bite-sized pieces we're just going to add half a cup to this and go from there here are my lovely apples doesn't it look so jolly and festive hi I do this year-round but I especially do it around the holidays because it's the green and the red together by the way the reason why I can't find my recipe is because my sister always calls me for recipes and then I never put them back where I should so I'm sure it's like sitting on a counter somewhere but I just haven't taken the time to find it okay we're going to dump our mayonnaise in here like I said I'm going to just do half a cup pop we'll mix that up and then we'll add some other stuff to it the way I make it if not so man easy it just kind of gives it a light coating I am actually using mirco up nut Mayo this is fake Mayo but it's good and gives it a good zip to it so okay that's hard to do with one hand okay now we need some celery I prefer to cut my celery into really small pieces because I just don't like a big chunk of celery so I'm just going to take my ribs and by the way if there will t just pop them in some water a cup of water I'm going to perk up a little bit stiffen up it's really easy to do I'm gonna cut mine maybe twice diagonally what that's not that I'm super crazy I need someone to hold this for me so I could do okay I'm gonna cut it like this down down the stock and then probably again right here so there's like some really small I'll show you and see how there's two marks are that's why I'm gonna cut and then I'm gonna chop chop chop chop chop sorry I have no assistant with me today so bear with me but this salad is really good it's really it feels light and fresh you feel like you're eating really healthy cuz you're getting your apple a day keeps the doctor away and then after that after I have this celery it's a little tricky because it's kind of what you like like how many raisins do you like in your salad how many nuts do you like in your salad so I'll probably end up doing maybe like two handfuls of raisin and then just a handful of nuts and I'm gonna these are actually full nuts pecans and I'm going over a set pecan depends very firm I say pecan even though I live in North Carolina don't hate me and yeah I'm just gonna chop these up a little bit and just throw them in there stir them up with everything and that's our salad except the special ingredient which is marshmallows I put a lot in because my kids pretty much just eat the marshmallows and apples yeah they heard the word marshmallow so yeah okay they're like little pieces about that big that's how I like it that you do a swamp okay I've almost got 3/4 of a cup of raisins that's what I'm going to use but you if you like more use more if you don't have a chopper thing like this or one of those mixer things chop your nuts sometimes I just put them in a little baggie like a ziplock baggie and oops take either a rolling pin or the edge of a heavier knife and just kind of break them up a little bit maybe like that all right we're going to throw those things in let's see there's that you dump the raisins to sprinkle sprinkle them okay I did about half a bag of marshmallows the regular is it twelve outside I see this is the regular yeah ten ounce or so size of marshmallows I can see there's opted in there regular ones okay well the salads done this one looks like it's really good you get a lot of different textures you get the crunchiness of the Apple in the celery and the softness with the raisins and the marshmallows and the saltiness of the nuts and the sweetness with everything else the zing of the Mayo is just really it's really good just like makes your mouth drool when you eat it I could eat this all day this is delicious just want you to know all right thanks a lot for watching and we'll see you next time on the green apple home you
