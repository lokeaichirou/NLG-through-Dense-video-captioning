 hey dudes I'm Hilah welcome to Hilah cooking so you'll know that I love tacos and tex-mex and Mexican food but today I'm gonna show you the mother of all tex-mex dishes and that is the crispy beef taco and I'm super excited about it this is my favorite things in the world to eat and I've got a cool little trick to show you to make your own shells cook a crispy tacos a crispy taco the crispy beef tacos alright first step is we're gonna saute our onions until they are translucent all right let's give these about five minutes or so okay now it's time to add my cumin seeds and I don't know I just use this whole cumin because that's what I always have on hand too lazy to grind it up so you can use ground whatever but I'm put these in in the hot pan and kind of let them get a little bit toasty it's gonna really bring out their aromatic oils and then I've got my chili powder and this is just like an ancho chili powder but whatever whatever you got on hand will do just fine and then jalapeno and garlic and three peppers I'm gonna put in a little bit of crushed red chili flakes - you leave that out if you want to keep it a little milder and you can also see the jalapenos if you want to keep it mild if you're serving little chillings okay now we put in the meat and just kind of break it up a little bit and now I'm going to show you the trick to get like superfine little ground beef crumbles like they have at Taco Bell which I used to love crispy Taco Bell tacos when I was kid I haven't had one in years but I can make them at home now so screw you to Taco Bell we're just gonna add some water maybe half a cup you could use beer also or broth but water works just fine so kind of get this all mixed up and the waters just gonna help it help you be able to kind of like break it into smaller pieces and it keeps it real moist cuz I'm using a lean ground beef here 90 percent lean okay see how this is already starting to look a little bit like Taco Bell okay not really right now it looks a little bit gross I know but just give it about five or ten minutes and I'm gonna add some salts and I'm gonna add some tomato paste and actually if you wanted to just use tomato sauce instead of the water that would take the place for the tomato paste and the water a little nice color a little depth of flavor okay cool so I'm just gonna let this simmer for about ten minutes keep an eye on it stir it once in a while keep it moving around so it stays in a little tiny pieces and then we go on to make some crisps but that goes crisps but cook cook I'll stop singing that song alright so the meats actually cooked now there's still a lot of liquid left now I'm gonna add the oregano dried oregano just want to crumble it up when you throw it in to bring out more of those flavors and then we're just gonna let this cook for maybe another five minutes until the water has evaporated out and then we're gonna make tacos okay so I've got these shells here that I baked and all I did was sprinkle some corn tortillas with a little bit of water stick them in the microwave for like thirty seconds just to steam them and soften him up and then spray them down with some you know nonstick cooking spray or whatever or you could use a little basting brush some oil on there and then the room in the oven laying it over the rack bars like that and bake them for like nine and then pull them off of the racks put him on a cookie sheet and then turn the oven off and left him in there just while the oven cooled off and that's just make sure that they get extra crispy and kind of like you know crisp and not just like chewy and weird so anyway you could totally buy shells but I don't know I thought this was a pretty cute little idea and and they're low-fat too so excellent ok my little taco shell guy a little bit on my taco meat yeah the fun thing if they're so messy and then you can put whatever you want but I like cheese and tomato and I put the cheese down first so it gets a little melty and some lettuce or in this case I'm actually using shredded cabbage cuz that's what I had on hand and I like to put a little bit of my homemade green salsa you know I'll post a link for that tube if you wanna make that it's delish ok here I go world's messiest food is about to get all over my dress I think probably hopefully not mmm all right well I hope you try this recipe if you have any questions leave them in the comments below and I will get to them as soon as I can and thanks so much for watching and I hope you enjoy these crispy beef tacos [Music]
