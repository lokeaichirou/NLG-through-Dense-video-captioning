 hey guys it's Friday night and some of you might be out at a pub it if you are usually the special on a Friday night is fish and chips a classic and this is my take on beer battered fish and chips now follow me camera guy come over here and have a look at this I've got some nice golden-brown beer battered fish and chips with my homemade tartar sauce a side of green peas and some french fries I'm gonna drizzle some lemon juice on that and it's ready to serve so if you want to know how to make this stick around on this episode of cooking in HD I'm making beer battered fish and chips let's start with our tartar sauce the main ingredients for the tartar sauce will be about a cup of mayonnaise note the juice of half a lemon we've got some sweet gherkins here finely chopped also finely chopped some yellow onion we use about a tablespoon or two of capers and for something a little bit different I've got some pickled onions and I've minced that into this bowl right here and I'm going to mix everything together right now that's all mixed in let's give it a little taste here nice bite a little bit of sweetness hang in this guitar sauce alright let's go over our ingredient list I've got five cod fillets here these were previously frozen if you get fresh ones all the better but that's just what I happen to have I've got a plate here with just plain all-purpose flour in it I'm going to use that to dredge the cod fillets in and then in here I've got 1 cup of flour half a cup of corn starch and half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and to that I'm going to add my beer this is a Sleeman Cream Ale it's a Canadian beer it's good I like it and I'm going to dump the whole 355 ml bottle into here and what I'll be looking for is consistency of something like pancake batter you know when goes our beer now this is cold that's kind of important because that means that we won't get lumps let me start to whisk this fully incorporate everything right now check out the consistency it's very much like pancake batter which is what I'm looking for and I've just added a little bit of salt and I'm not adding pepper because I've got cayenne pepper in there and that's going to give us just a little bit of heat so this is just the right consistency and I'm gonna okay so I'm gonna take my first piece of cod and what I want to do here is I'm just coating it in the flour and try to just use one hand because this is going to make it dry and then the next step I'm going to make it wet by putting it into the beer batter and I'm using my other hand for that so I'm going to cover it with my beer batter and once I've got it nice and covered and take it over to my frying pan and just drop it in all right it's the next one okay so this hand for dry throw it in the beer batter and then this hand for the web and I like a lot of beer-batter online so I'm just going to just absolutely cover all right so these are done let me show you what they look like all right you guys nice gold and brown color on there so I'm going to plate these but first I'm going to put them on a paper towel plates just to let the grease run off and then we'll plate them and I'll show you what the final product looks like okay so here's what the final product looks like I'm serving it with french fries some green peas I've got two fillets on there and this is my homemade tartar sauce you can see the nice golden brown batter on them and then I'm just going to take this lemon drizzle it on top and it's ready to serve so this is my beer battered cod fish fillets served on a Friday and I'm looking forward to having this without a glass of my Sleeman ale Cheers
