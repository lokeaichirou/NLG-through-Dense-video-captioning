 hi everyone and welcome back to chef seats today we'll be preparing steamed mussels with a coconut curry broth and these wonderful Southeast Asian flavors are sure to wow your palate so let's get ready for another adventure once again only thing we're going to need are a few simple ingredients so let's get started everybody the first step and I think the most important step is cleaning our mussels make sure that all our mussels are closed and if there are any open mussels in there just tap them together and if they won't close just discard them immediately that means they're dead after that make sure we give them a very good rinse rinse them and shake them up a little bit they throw that dirt and Rifkind out of them and do this process about three or four times until the water starts running very thick you see how I just shake them move all together and was hiding together well this kind of suck in this blood and they're just gonna spit it out here we go carefully inspect each one also you don't want to have one bad mussel ruin your entire back after repeating this process about three times until the water starts run clearly strain them and refrigerate until ready to cook then we can start preparing our onions for slicing after our onions we could slice some of our shallots nice and thin slices followed by slicing some more garlic as well in the meantime let's start heating up a pan over a medium high heat so we can get Lydia saute our aromatics with our mussels now that we have this ready we can just pop it in a little bit of oil and not too much and this is going to be a very very quick cooking procedure and that's also one of my favorite parts about having muscles that it's a very quick saute of our aromatics of a very quick steaming of our muscles and it's just a wonderful dish that's prepared in almost mince it's okay to get a little bit of color on our aromatics the colonization is going to help in the flavor and actually enhance the flavor of this dish and at this point is time for us to add our red curry paste it's very important that we sauteed produce a moment just to allow the spices to come back alive and so make sure we do this over a high heat cooking stirring quite often that's all feeding up all this turf you're gonna be able to smell all these different spices and aromatics coming out it's smells wonderful let that go pick your nose this is all real time everybody so don't have to worry about how long it actually takes now we've had a little bit of our fish sauce this has quite a pungent nose foot so don't be alarmed it's actually very friendly flavor when it's balanced with a coconut milk yeah stir everything together and we're just gonna bring this up to a quick boil and bring it down maybe by a third so it's going to concentrate in flavor see how is still a little loose right now well I'm going to bring it down it's going to tighten up after we add the mussels to the pan all the juice of the mussels are going to infuse into this as well doesn't really get much better as you're watching your coconut milk produced you can see the bubbles you're starting to get thicker and thicker all the bubbles and you can see the lines when we stir it how it separates see the little space in between it's getting thicker our sauce now let's just add our muscles in after we have the most of them give it a stir make this cover with the lid this process of plugging take us no more than two minutes in the meantime because our picking our herbs now Thai curry and cilantro pretty much go hand in hand with each other so of course I'm going to have to finish this dish with some fresh cilantro now this cilantro is very delicate it's also okay if we add a little bit of the stem to this dish because we're going to cook it down very delicately so it's okay if you don't rip off all your stems you know in Thailand they actually use the stems for sauce so feel free to use a little bit of stem so that's where about a minute of only being covered up and steaming away look at this they're all opening up already so let's just give them a little shuffle mix them up a touch make sure there's no open guys left all that flavors all marinated and infused into it then we could just toss our herbs right on top let that wilt down well let me just grab that pan and run away I want to eat it now see how thick your sauce is getting as well now it has a coconut the curry the mussel broth then fused into it we're really going to enjoy this one now the moment we all been waiting for plate up time so I just says simply I just spoon it right onto the bagel bowl that we're going to serve it in sauce muscle cilantro all of it piled on top of each other mussels are a finger food there's no reason to get overly fancy when it comes into plating mussels top all these guys up right on top of each other highlight nice and high maybe a little bit more fresh cilantro just on top let's turn it to give you a better view there you go and a squeeze of fresh lime juice as a finishing touch just to highlight this dish so there we have it everyone mussels with a curried coconut broth I hope you really like it
