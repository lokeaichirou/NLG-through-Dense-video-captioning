 which came first the chicken or the egg and the answer is of course they both did one inside the other a question I'm often asked is how can you tell if an egg is really fresh without of course breaking it well you can try the water test take a bowl of cold water and then put in some eggs and you'll notice that the fresh one will sink to the bottom while the one that's not quite fresh will stand up on its pointy end and the one that's quite stale will bounce around on the surface simple another question you cook some hard-boiled eggs you put them in the refrigerator along with the fresh ones and then later you don't know which is which how can you tell again without breaking the eggs it's simple just take them for a spin as you can see the hard board one likes to spin like mad whereas the fresh one doesn't at all now one of my favorite recipes is bacon annex and I'm not doing that on consuming passions today but instead a recipe that uses those elements it is spaghetti carbonara and classic and this is the consuming passions version first I get my spaghetti going in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water i grate a little nutmeg and then plunge in some of things spaghetti stirring it around once and then leaving it well alone now while it's cooking I prepare some good smoky bacon by slicing it up into strips and then I crisp it in a large nonstick frying pan now I pour off the excess bacon fat turn the heat down low and add a little butter and just a little extra virgin olive oil now the next phase is in a large bowl i whisk two whole eggs did you know by the way that egg whites are among the only alkaline foods you can find along with baking powder most of our foods are acidic and I had two egg yolks now although some recipes call for just egg yolks I find this dish less rich using whole eggs as well as the two egg yolks incidentally were you aware that an egg yolk is half water yes it is and 34% lipids that's fats and so on and 16% protein and minerals and I'll stir in little cream tablespoon or two if this is starting to look quite rich remember it's going in with quite a lot of spaghetti and I'm adding something else besides the grinding a black pepper a pinch of white pepper because I like to have the two different flavors and whether black or white they come from the same plant by the nigrum which suggests black native of India and Italy one so valuable it was used as currency now to cheese I like to grate in my own Parmesan cheese and a little certainly goes a long way in this dish and I add a cup of finely chopped parsley the Italian parsley this mixture is now ready for the final stage of preparation just moments before serving the spaghetti is drained and it doesn't matter if a little water is led to the spaghetti the pan with the bacon is put on medium heat and once sizzling as here I tossed through the spaghetti a large wok like this is great for this purpose amongst the spaghetti has started to steam i stir through the egg mixture and cook to a smooth consistency making sure not to overcook I'll finish up with scrambled eggs now an optional extra little cooked asparagus or broccoli is here to color crunch and added freshness are then tossed through a little more Parmesan cheese a little more parsley and it's time to serve on a large warmed bowl degree of difficulty very low preparation time well the whole dish can be prepared in 25 minutes capability it's best eaten straight away but maybe reheated stirring through a little extra cream or stock to remove a final flourish of a little more parsley a little more parmesan and a little more black pepper and the dish is ready to eat the consuming passions version of spaghetti carbonara a bacon an excellent dish especially served with a salad and some crusty bread and possibly for one accompaniment a Barbera Australian from consuming passions until next time
