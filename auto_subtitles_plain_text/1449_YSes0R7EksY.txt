 vot is one of the world's most famous sandwiches and today we're going to show you how we make out our version needs homemade breads we've got strong flour and we're going to flavor that with sun-dried tomato puree rosemary and garlic some crispy bacon as a fillings and cheese and tomato basil mayonnaise and lettuce in two forms of leaf gonna be incredible how's it going to compare to a normal kind of boring since doji rapid wraps congealed PLT horribly always giving a whole nother level a whole its own pots with strong flour so that can all go into our machine to that we're going to add a tablespoon of sugar a teaspoon of salt 300 mils of water a sachet of dried yeast give it a whisk up with a fork all of these weights and measurements do need to be precise because you make bread you can get all the details in the link down below see Sanji's do get kind of a bad rap nowadays only very good they do which is why it when we ask you have with your video tape you guys sit the bread has to be as important as the fill it really has to go I completely agree that's going to go in you can clamp it down and then switch it on you quickly done good wait - let's finish this boring for that spot that needs a good sort of 5 or 10 is needed in the meantime we can make some amazing flavors to go with it so sometimes not so cure right can you take one clove of garlic yeah and just peel and crush that and I'm going to strip the leaves off fresh rosemary and chop it up as well now normally you'd leave that for another 5 minutes or so to need a way until it's really soft and elastic e but it's beginning to get that way and I'll show you what happens next so just kind of roll it into one ball disconnect your bowl place it in the bottom and cover it with a tea towel and then I've got a t-tail leave in a warm place for about an hour hour and a half until it's proved and you end up with something that looks a little bit like this really big reveal whoa that's not the same one literally three times its size you can see all the air bubbles and all the yeast doing its activity and now we can flavor it with our challenge plate a wild Kanye flavor it at that stage a good point if you crave it too early it stops at proving process okay so now we add in our sun-dried tomato puree all of your garlic and the rosemary and then back onto our machine to knead again and get all those flavors combined and all the sun-dried tomato puree gives it an amazing Italian flavor so the bridge is as good as its oh Allah and not just color but the smell now as well oh wow it is quite sticky at this stage you've added in all that Sunday tomato it doesn't look like a break wiggle but I have a flower but just enough to bring it together takes a very very light dough flower up a tray and then place your bread onto that tray remember what's happened it's proved and it's become huge yeah we've beaten all that air out you know the flavor in you now need to let it prove again so that it gets all the air back in so that then needs to be covered again in a tea towel and left for another hour and a half in another one place so this is why you're in the office so late last night wasn't it early this morning you end up with something looks like like an incredible loaf of bread it's got all of the sun-dried tomato flavors running through it that's ridiculous and then this dibbler makes it a posh and homemade Porsche that can go into an oven 180 degrees Celsius and it needs 30 minutes until it's golden risen on top and we turn upside down you can tap the bottom and it's nice and hollow and what you're left with is one of those sorry how many have you done already we can have some amazing quick but it's not just good feel to you can pretty much anything right dunking soups or Laver whatever you guys suggested would make amazing futons yes of course I write because we'll be smarter in the garlic and rosemary amazing croutons again so next up a tray to crisp up our bacon bacon has to be crispy of cold in a bit a course therefore has to be thin as well yes you can use streaky bacon all back rushes yeah but thinner is good because it will cook away see without being too leathery this was your favorite as well so that's going to go under the grill that's another that's another easy mistake a traditional BLT five ingredients bacon lettuce tomato obvious right yeah right yeah mayonnaise so a traditional one beam has ml two we've done the bread now for the mayonnaise and for our mayonnaise we're going to add a few more Italian flavors we have got some fresh basil and zest of a lemon I just want to take a little bit the peel I'll put that that's all you need just that much mayonnaise it fresh basil peach black pepper little blend it up and next up outsmart a BLT okay this is what I know you and I don't agree because I would not do that for me a soggy bit in the tomato is what makes a BLT I like just like a sandwich now a little bit controversial yep cheese and a BLT you guys are straight so here it is but an Italian cheese mozzarella keeping the Italian theme so it's a bbm c LT you're just you're just making up let this again ridiculous now though lots of little tiny BLT amazing it's like very very thin slices of that any of these components you can leave that if you want you could stick to just the bread the mayonnaise lettuce tomato bacon but it really does take it to another level and why we're doing Italian flavors that's what you guys wanted I'm Italian twist on our ultimate BLT so we simply abide I just want to show you inside here you guys said it should be toasted our BLT so another T in our BLT toasted complicated BB C mlct that's the one but already go to toast one side of it so what we do is turn the bacon over at this point we crispy crispy along with our bread ah perfect vacuum and the final part of our BLT something else that divided your opinion was lettuce in the recipe lab I did it with Chris because I thought the mustardy flavor the press would be awesome and how do you spell Chris with a seek not to know and therefore you said it should be lettuce boom like that it was a it was a divided community someone said that was a pretty forest well somebody said it should be traditional so we're going for both the reason being we are painting everyone here this is crunchy it gives you an amazing texture and color the master Chris is pepper in a it's a really nice and every flavor look at that a thumb so what we've got now is bread tomato bread toasted on one side not on the other that's going to be the base and our bacon you wanna forget a little bit of a sandwich wrapper because always left now is the construction so basil and lemon mayonnaise then for our tomato why so that all those tomato juices can run into that mayonnaise just as you said mixed up cress crunch from our other lettuce and then bacon and we have to be generous with the bacon cup of that and wait for thin slice of mozzarella and there we go it's almost too good to put a lid on it also good transfer it over to our takeout bag and there we go our version of the ultimate BLT sorted can't guarantee it's me the easiest thing to eat oh boy that your platform the best coming through throw muck that truly is the best BB C L M TT I've ever had or simplify the ultimate BLT but we want to know from you what other sandwiches shouldn't making comment below Yes No you
