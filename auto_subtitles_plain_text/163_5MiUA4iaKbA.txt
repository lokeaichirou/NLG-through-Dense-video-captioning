 everybody tinman here welcome to my easy Cooking Channel today I'm going to make some steak and shrimp kabobs what I have here is a pound and a half of stew me and actually use that in a crock pot recipe the other day and it was really good meat after I browned it I was just eating it like that so you use it for my kabobs and I'm going to marinate it in this garlic and herb marinade and I'm also going to unthaw some of these 31:40 shrimp and get the shells off of him and put the shrimp in that same garlic and herb marinade okay this is going to be really simple that's the way I like it stew meats all cut up already so I just poured some of that marinade on it all I'm doing with these shrimp is I kind of ran some water over them time thawne a little bit and I'm just pulling the pull on the shell off like that and dropping them in a bowl of marinade same marinade okay my meats been marinating here for about an hour and a half two hours and it's looking really good I put the shrimp in the fridge because the shrimp cooked faster than the miss will so I figured by letting this come up to room temperature and putting the shrimp in the fridge it'll help equalize the cooking time a little bit I'm going to use these metal skewers that I bought it's easier to thread the meat onto these metal ones okay I'm doing everything the easy way today so using my gas grill we'll just cook these until the shrimp turn pink which shouldn't really take too long okay it's been about seven or eight minutes I've been moving these around a little bit it looked pretty good to me I think it's about time to get them off of there looks like these surf and turf kebabs turned out great no veggies on these babies just pure meat I'm starving so I'm gonna dive into these things thanks for watching you guys and I'll talk to you next time
