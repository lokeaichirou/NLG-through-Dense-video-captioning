 everyone is Jay del coro here at the aimless cook Happy New Year hope you're having a great year so far and I hope you had a fun and safe holiday today on the aimless cook we're going to be making a Japanese noodle bowl called tsukimiya dong now tsuki mood means moon-viewing and it's named that because of the egg that we're going to add at the end resembles the moon it's a really easy soup base that we've done before but I'm gonna show you with some new ingredients how to put this together it's really easy to do I'm going to show you how to do it right now on the angles cook so let's start with our soup base by combining in a small bowl 2 tablespoons of brown sugar with three tablespoons each of soy sauce and mirin now we're going to take 2/3 of that mixture and put it into a saucepan where we're just going to heat it up and simmer it until everything is dissolved and combined finally to that soy mixture we're going to add two and a half cups of dashi now we're just going to mix that together again bring it to a simmer and then let's move on over here on the cutting board I got a bunch of nice fresh oyster mushrooms and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to cut the bottom off of this so I can hand shed them to manageable pieces and then I'm going to add them to a frying pan with some butter 2 tablespoons of butter on high heat and saute them for a few minutes until they're fragrant and golden brown now to that I'm going to add the remaining soy mixture from the bowl from earlier I'm going to continue cooking until that mixture thickens when that thickens up I'm just going to take them off the heat and set aside in another large pot at a rolling boil here I got some udon noodles and I'm just going to cook them according to the directions until they are done it usually takes about three or four minutes now I got some lemons and what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to lightly and very carefully shave the zest I need a piece about as big as a fingernail and I'm going to use one piece in each serving to add a little more depth to the flavor you're going to notice it and trust me now before I assemble I'm just going to add about six snow peas to my simmering broth I'm just gonna briefly cook it for about 60 seconds to assemble I'm going to start by putting a piece of lemon zest from the bottom of each bowl followed by the strained Bhutan noodles I'm going to follow that with some soup stock and then top with the snow peas mushroom and then finally the egg now you can use a raw egg or in this case I use some onsen tamago now if you want the recipe for onsen tamago you can click on the link in the video description below finally we're going to garnish with a sprinkle of Buddha Kaka and then serve so that is it that's my recipe for zucchini food on hope you take this recipe make it yours and have fun in the kitchen which brings me to my question of the day how do you eat your noodles you slurp them really loud or you try to eat them quietly let me know in the comments down below and we'll see you next time
