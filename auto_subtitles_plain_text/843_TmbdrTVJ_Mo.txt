 I want to make a sandwich I'm going to use some flour herbs de Provence Dijon butter Gris air use Swiss if you don't have free air some ham and I'm going to warm this milk up in the microwave so we mean milk and some nutmeg and some bread and let's get started I'm going to start this out with using a tablespoon of butter melting that down and a tablespoon of all-purpose flour it might be just a bit over a tablespoon that's okay we want to cook this for about a minute I'm on just below medium heat not real hot and we'll let that cook for about another 30 seconds to a minute that has bubbled away just for a about a minute total we add warm milk now I put it in the microwave stir this in I'm also going to add just a little bit of white pepper a little bit of salt and just a dash of nutmeg and allow this to thicken when it comes to a boil or it gets real hot it will thicken so just take it a couple minutes so this is bubbled up and thickened I let it bubble for about a minute and a half I'm going to add our cheese it's about a half a cup of cheese well just go ahead and turn the heat off and let that cheese melt in and start making our sandwiches we'll just let this sit here and cool off take your toasted bread I put it in the toaster sliced it toast dude it and put just a just a taste of mustard just for flavor on each slice of bread you're him please don't be cheap with your ham put a decent amount on here these are going to be some of the best in my opinion some of the best ham and grilled cheese sandwiches you've ever had just like that no more there when we're here some of your greer or swiss if you're using Swiss do this is it looking good I can't wait to eat this tell you I can't wait add some of your bechamel or cheese sauce this recipe is really in that for for sandwiches and I'm just making two one for me and one for you Morris Swiss or gray air on top it's an optional topping of herbs de Provence just a slight touch and this is going in my 400 degree oven after 15 minutes here's our sandwiches I was croque monsieur and let's get ready to eat I have one dished up plated and I like to serve with little dill pickles and a big green tossed salad I guarantee you this is delicious and I hope you make it thanks so much for watching
