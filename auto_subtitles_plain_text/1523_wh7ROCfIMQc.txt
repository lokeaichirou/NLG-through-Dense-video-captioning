 if someone asked me what's the best Lebanese salad I'd have to say it's a toss-up between tabbouleh or fattoush I'm Shimano I'm the editor of taste of Beirut calm I'm sitting here in the Lebanese mountains it's a perfect summer day and I'm making fattoush Oh there are two things in fattoush that you absolutely need sumac and pita bread croutons now there's people who like to bake them some people like to fry them I like them fried they stay crunchy I'm boring fresh lemon juice over the sumac I'm adding mashed garlic over the mixture I'm adding olive oil and blending it I'm chopping all the veggies starting with the tomatoes the cucumbers the bell peppers the radishes the purslane the lettuce parsley and finally the onions now I transfer them to a salad bowl and pour the dressing and toss a bit I'm cutting strips of pita bread with itchin shears and frying the sticks in hot oil until golden-brown and draining them over favorite dolls now I like to season my croutons with extra sumac it makes them super good nothing
