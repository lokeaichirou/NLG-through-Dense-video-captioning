 welcome to Japanese cooking 101 today we are making yaki udon yaki we don't need stir-fried udon noodles with meat and vegetables it's a quick and easy dish that is great for a weekday supper here are the ingredients we have some udon noodles we defrosted the frozen kind this time under running water but you can also boil the dried noodles for the meat we are using pork cut forced-air fries for vegetables we have carrot green bell pepper onion and cabbage we use vegetable oil for stir frying and salt and soy sauce for seasoning very simple first we prepare the vegetables just cut it up any way you want we cut carrot into thin sticks and roughly chopped cabbage and take some seeds out of the bell pepper and slice thinly and onion sliced thinly as well now heat the pan at medium-high heat and add vegetable oil first cook the meat we like to use pork for flavor but you can use any meat you want chicken pieces or thinly sliced beef will also be great when the meat is cooked add vegetables onion and harder vegetables first just simply stir-fry in the pan just like making stir-fried vegetables add cabbage and continue frying this is a great way to use up any leftover vegetables you may have in your refrigerator when the vegetable gets slightly wilted add doodle noodles and keep steer frying you don't is of course great in soup but these noodles have very nice texture when fried and very filling after a couple of more minutes we are going to add seasonings just sprinkle some salt and soy sauce usually we use very simple seasonings for yaki udon you can also use were sister sauce instead of soy sauce if you like more savory flavor we like to keep it simple but still tastes really good serve it on the plate and if you like top it with some bonito flakes for some extra flavor and pickled ginger when you want to finish up leftover ingredients in a back of the refrigerator and to eat a quick but tasty meal this is the one to try pushy
