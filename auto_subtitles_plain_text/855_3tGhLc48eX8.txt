 [Music] hi i'm catherine i'm an editor at askmen and today we're making caesar salad it's pretty simple in terms of ingredients but it's all about the technique let's first start with what we're going to be using today we've got romaine lettuce eggs lemons fresh garlic parmesan cheese olive oil extra virgin anchovies and that's it so let's get started first we're going to crush the garlic with a garlic press you can also chop it up with a knife but that's way more annoying so we've got our garlic here now we're going to just chop up the anchovy a lot of people feel like anchovies are gross you just need to get over that right now it's really just it's like yummy salt that's that's all we're talking about and we're gonna mash it up so that it really kind of just becomes a paste and actually the original caesar salad which simon majumdar talks about in his article was made not with anchovies but with worcestershire sauce which contains anchovies so that's kind of the same flavor but it's just like a dash of sauce instead of the whole anchovies and now we are going to separate an egg there's a few different methods to doing this some people just run it right through their hands i just do the kind of back and forth style and there you go i'm just going to wash my hands now because i have egg white on my hands and that's unsanitary so we've got the the raw egg yolk and we're going to mix it all together and now we're going to add half a lemon and the lemon juice the acid from the lemon juice is going to essentially cook the egg really get that lemon in there and then i'm going to whisk it so that it really gets well combined now this is the part that is actually a little bit more of a technique thing this is where you're going to emulsify olive oil into the egg mixture here so when you're doing this you can mess this up so pay close attention you have to combine the olive oil very slowly in a slow stream mixing all along and you can take breaks if you feel like you're getting stressed out and you'll notice that it's kind of looking like it's thickening up a tiny bit and that's the egg and the olive oil working together now all we have to do is grate the cheese in so this is a microplane grater i know a chef who says that this is the sexiest kitchen implement that you can buy and i would say you put you know a quarter of a cup or more this is basically gonna kind of impart a creaminess to your dressing you can put as much as you want now you are at the point where you can add your lettuce so i just rip it with my hands like this and i put it pretty big coarse pieces now another big benefit to doing this table side is that you really should eat this like pretty much right after you dress it because it gets like the dressing is pretty heavy and it kind of gets soggy and gross quickly so now you toss and you really got to toss it pretty well because it's thick look how nice that thick dressing is but you really have to get everything coated [Music] and then you finish with a little bit more cheese on top which as much as you want if you're like really into cheese you can put so much that you can't even see the green of the lettuce anymore but that's kind of gross there we go and we just made a caesar salad from scratch
