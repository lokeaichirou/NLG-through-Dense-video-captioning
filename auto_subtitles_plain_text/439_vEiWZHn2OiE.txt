 welcome to Benjamin TV today I'm gonna make one of my more popular dishes from the vlog carbonara and this is Carmen a spaghetti carbonara it's delicious it's simple and you know what anybody can do it and I'm gonna get right into the ingredients all right first off I've got spaghetti okay I'm just I'm just using store-bought Barilla if you want to use organic you want to use a fancy stuff from the farmers market be my guest I'm just using this regular spaghetti I'm also using a I'll be using two egg yolks as well as one full egg with the white I'm also gonna be using Parmesan cheese if you can get the fresh stuff and grate it yourself also I'll be using salt and pepper and olive oil not optional because I know a lot of tellings are watching this and saying that's all you need optional if you want to take to the next level the Benjamin TV level I've also got sliced up garlic and heavy whipping cream the sliced up garlic just gives it a little bit more flavor as well as the heavy cream just makes it a more silky smooth texture that I love when I serve carbonara but you can totally take those two out last but not least I also have pancetta now the pancetta you can substitute with bacon if you don't have pancetta available just make sure you go ahead and slice that up nice and thin all right the tools that I'll be using is obviously something to boil the pasta in make sure you fill that with plenty of water and get that to a rolling boil before you even start cooking I'm also using a 12 inch frying pan this is a saute pan but you can use a regular frying pan also you're gonna have a whisk to whisk up your sauce you're gonna also be using tongs I have a ladle I've got a spaghetti ladle also have a large spoon all right first thing you're gonna do is slice or pinch it up nice and thin if you're using bacon just cut that across the bacon and slice that thin as well next you're gonna go ahead and crack your eggs remember you're going to use two yoke's so you're gonna separate the egg yolk from the egg white do this by tossing the egg yolk back and forth between the two shells next you're gonna go ahead and shred some cheese at this point you're gonna go ahead and take your eggs Parmesan cheese black pepper if you're using heavy whipping cream go ahead and WITSEC together in a bowl first of all make sure you have your water boiling okay because you're gonna get your pasta cooking as soon as possible also get your 12 inch pan heated now I like to cook it on the low heat because when I make pancetta pancetta cooks fairly easily and you want to make sure it's on a low heat but make sure your pan is nice and warmed up okay first off you're gonna put some olive oil into your pan next you'll put that pancetta let the pancetta go ahead and cook for about mmm 5 to 10 minutes depending on how it cooks and if you're using bacon once it gets crispy but not burnt go ahead and turn the heat off and put that to the side at this point you're ready to put your pasta in make sure the heat under the pot is at the highest you can get it and make sure it's at a rolling boil and put your pasta in follow the directions of your pasta what you're gonna want to do is make sure about 2 or 3 minutes before your pasta is done you're going to turn the heat back on on your 12 inch frying pan and what you're gonna do at this point is go ahead and throw that garlic in there let that sizzle a little bit but not to the point where it's too Brown just about a minute or two before your pasta is done you're gonna want to go ahead and turn off the heat the reason you're gonna do this is because you're going to continue cooking the pasta that is just barely al dente which is undercooked in the pan with the pancetta or bacon go ahead and drain your pasta very well once that's drained very well throw that right into the pan with the meat go ahead and mix that around for a few minutes on a medium heat and what you're going to do is take that large spoon ladle in some of the water that you use a boiler pasta to make sure that your pasta doesn't stick to the pan that's gonna be the base of your sauce after a few minutes of cooking on that medium heat you're just about done remember you don't want to burn this but you want to make sure you cook the pasta through because it was al dente go ahead and add your pasta to the bowl and you're gonna pour your egg wash right onto the pasta make sure all the bacon pieces are in there with the pasta in that bowl and mix thoroughly while adding parmesan to taste you can also add more black pepper if you'd like at this point you're just about done go ahead and plate it and you're ready to eat a few notes I didn't use salt in the boiling water because the pancetta is so salty and saying goes for bacon that you really don't need a lot of salt in this dish also if you're worried about the raw eggs the pasta and the bacon is so hot from the oil that when you put that egg into the pasta it's gonna cook it slightly and I wouldn't worry about it the final touch to this carbonara I like to pour a little bit more olive oil to give it some elegance and ready to eat all right there you go that's a carbonara I've got my friend guy here from DVE store.com he actually helped us with a lighting today I wanted him to be the taste tester and I've got green onions that we actually put on the garnish I got this idea from cooking with dog who was an inspiration for this recipe go ahead and you can put some of that on there is it good it's really good so anyways that's Benjamin TV make sure you subscribe comment below
