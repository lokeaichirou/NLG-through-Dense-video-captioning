 [Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make an avocado BLT now I constantly get requests for like more salads more sandwiches just kind of quicker things to eat and a BLT is a classic but I'm throwing in the avocado because I really like it so let me take your reading gradients so we can get started I'm going to need some thick cut bacon some Bibb lettuce or Boston lettuce whatever it's calling your store some sliced tomatoes avocado a little bit of lemon juice some fresh parsley extra virgin olive oil salt pepper and the bread of your choice I am using just gorgeous Italian bread so around loaf and I've cut about half inch slices off of that but you can use whatever bread that you like it's up to you now the first thing we do is the oven preheated to 425 and I'm going to toast my bread and cook my bacon at the same time in the oven now I'm going to cook my bacon all I'm doing right now is just drizzling my bread with a little bit of olive oil and what I'm going to do with my bacon is I'm going to cook it on my broiler pan here or you can use any kind of pan that you can put a rack over because that way the bacon fat car drips down and the bacon cooks evenly it doesn't cook you know doesn't sit in fat so I'm just going to put my bacon slices on here and I'm going to put the bacon and the bread in the oven the bacon will take about 10 to 15 minutes the bread should take about 10 minutes the ovens on at 425 once they're done we'll put the whole thing together pretty much I just took my bread out of the other and now I'm going to work on the avocado now I've done is I've happed it and I've taken out the stone and I'm going to take half of this and I'm going to put it into this bowl now what I'm doing is because I don't want to use Mayo I'm going to mash half of the avocado and the half of the avocado is going to ask is that creaming component that would be on your BLT which is classically Mayo OOP but I don't want to see other lemon putting in some lemon juice to stop it from browning and give me some color pinch of salt and some fresh parsley and I'm just going to take a fork and just mash it all together alright so I have that done I took my other half of the avocado and I just sliced it I also took my bacon out of the oven and we're pretty much ready to assemble now I'm going to take one piece of bread at a time and I'm going to divide the mashed avocado mixture between the two slices that looks good take some tomato slices you can use any kind of tomatoes you want and of course you don't have to use the avocado if you don't want to you could just use regular mail and make a regular BLT but I like it this way it's so nice you know it's a nice twist it's a nice change on a classic I'm going to season the tomatoes with a little salt and pepper and that's good and just a little teeny tiny drizzle of olive oil on the tomatoes themselves like less than a half a teaspoon now that you have your bottom layer I'm going to top it with the bacon not to the other slice I'm going to take some of this avocado that we've sliced and I'm just going to divide that with the two remaining slices season the avocados with some salt because you know avocados they need salts because they're very bland they're very rich in flavor meaning they're very thick um when you taste an avocado it's not like a light thing it does taste very rich is I've got a lot of healthy fats in it but it is relatively bland I'm putting this lettuce on the wrong side tap the avocado just a little bit of your lettuce and then just pretty much unite the two and that is done whoops oh that's gorgeous God is money mm-hmm so bug so easy you can make this if you want through this way or you can make it more traditional without the avocado it's completely up to you but if you want to get this recipe go Debbie W on your comm I'll see you next time bye bye [Music]
