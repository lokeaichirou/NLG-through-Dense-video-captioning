 so these are the ingredients we're gonna need to make the burritos well you're gonna need about a cup of shredded cheese a cup of rice and using the minute brown rice and a can of refried beans I'm using vegetarian 1/4 cup of salsa any variety that you like I've got a table spoon of chocolate cesium and eat flour turn to you the first thing you're gonna want to do is cook your rice and that mine just took 5 minutes and I did cook it in some chicken broth because it gives it a little extra flavor but it really doesn't make that big of a difference so yes you just wanna get your rice cooked and you do want to have it like cool off just a little bit and then you can start getting everything else ready then all you'll need to do is pour all of your ingredients into a large bowl and stir them around until they're all mixed together completely also you'll want to have your oven preheated to 450 degrees all right next all you'll need to do is start filling your burritos so I went ahead in lined baking sheet with tin foil so I'm just folding my last burrito and it did make all eight of them this is the last one it's a little bit small but it's alright so what I do is just fold in each end like this and then just fold the other way that's kind of tiny one but the burritos and then I'm gonna cut them before out of time at 450 before I put them in the oven I'm just gonna spray them with some cooking oil really fast just over the tops all right bake them for about five to seven minutes and then I'm gonna flip them over spray them again and bake them for another five minutes all right so these bakes for five minutes and I just slipped them over so that they can brown on the other side and I'm gonna put them back in for about three more minutes or until they're brown on both sides so those flip for three more minutes and the back spot a little more brown and then the tops just slightly brown so if you want them even browner you can just leave them in a little bit longer and they'll darken up on each side now I'm just gonna go ahead and put the second batch in and ivory sprayed the pan and the burritos and they're just gonna go back in for five minutes and then probably another three minutes just like that all right so here's the finished thing I have it cut open so you can see the inside the shell is slightly crispy and then it's just warm and gooey on the inside so I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll talk to you soon bye what do you think mmm that's great ten seven or ten scale of seven to ten turns really good and seven is it's a little bit good Oh what's a ten what did you think we're okay
