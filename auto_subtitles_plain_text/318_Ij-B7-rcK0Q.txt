 hi there I'm Steve Owens and you're in Steve's kitchen and welcome and a happy st. Patrick's Day to everybody today I'm gonna make one of my favorite Irish dishes colcannon it is delightful now an Irishman and a kangaroo go into a bar well if you want to know the answer to that or the punch line what's the end of the video let's get on and make colcannon so first of all we want to get those potatoes on and cooking now depending on the amount of people you're serving you need to take your potatoes peel and cut them up we've put them into a saucepan here and we've just covered them over with water now I'm adding about a teaspoon or so of salt just to season the water and then we'll take them over to the stove and bring them up to the boil now they need to cook for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are nice and tender now when you take a knife and you push it into the potato and it goes through without any resistance you know your potatoes are ready to mash so I bring my saucepan over to the sink and just holding the lid on at an angle we should just pour out the hot water now if you take your meshes straight away and try to mesh those potatoes they'll be a little bit dry so to make our mashed potato a little smoother I'm just going to add a knob of butter into there and a splash or so of full cream milk and now that's a lot easier to mash up to a smooth mashed potato so now our mash is ready we're just set that aside and get on and prepare the colcannon now traditionally cabbage or kale is used but I really think kale is the best and I've got my kale here we just want to pull the leaves off the side we don't want the stalks because they're a little bit tough now once it's off the stalks we're just going to take a knife and roughly chop this up it doesn't have to be too accurate we're just going to break it into smaller pieces and then we can lift those and put them into a large saucepan and now I'm going to put water into this pot probably only about an inch and we're going to bring that up to the boil and then simmer it for about five minutes that should allow the kale to wilt down and just one last little point whilst that comes up to the boil I'm just going to season that with a little bit of salt so whilst our kale is on to a boil I'm just going to take three onions here I'll just cut the tops off and then we're going to finely slice these up so we have three spring onions they're finely diced then I've got a small saucepan here and I've got half a cup of full thick cream and we're just going to take those spring onions now and pop them in the cream and then we're going to take that over to the stove and we just bring that up to a simmer so when that cream has come up to a boil I'm just gonna turn it off and let the onions continue to cook a little bit now if you come over here you can see my kale whoops is that too much steam my kale is completely wilted down and that now is ready to use the potatoes of course are all mashed and on the side now strain the kale from the big saucepan and I'm bringing my creamy mashed potato over and putting it into that pan I'm going to add another decent-sized knob of butter into there and then in goes my cream which is now infused with the flavor of those spring onions and now that kale that we've drained all the water out of that goes in and then we're going to thoroughly mix this together now I've seen people use blenders with this but I really think it makes it too fine it's meant to have lots of texture in it and I want to season this with a good twist of black pepper and that really is just to taste now there is my beautiful colcannon it's getting ready to serve but what about the kangaroo well I've got here some lovely kangaroo bangers or kangaroo snags as we call them I'm just going to cook those up where the punchline of the story at the end was the Irishman came out with a taste for ooh and why not because they are delicious I've got some kangaroo snags here I'm just going to cut them up into small slices now I've got my cold cannon here in a bowl and I'm just going to do the traditional thing which is to make a little divot in the top but a bit of butter in there that'll melt and I'm taking my little roof snags and I'm just dropping them around the outside now core cannon itself is a wonderful dish and with a little bit of sausage in there it just adds a meatiness that I absolutely love and I can tell you I can't wait to get stuck into this it looks delicious the colors are fantastic give this colcannon a try no wonder this is one of the most popular Irish dishes it is fantastic it is delicious I hope you don't mind me
