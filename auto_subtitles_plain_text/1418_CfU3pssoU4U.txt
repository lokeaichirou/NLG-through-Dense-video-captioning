 hey guys it's will retain a strong here today we're gonna make got some baked onion rings very similar to my cauliflower wings that are coated with flour and water and then dipped into a bread crumb so we're gonna do basically the same thing I've got the general rule is a cup of flour to in a cup of water one to one ratio so I didn't now put in a cup of water I mean a cup of flour but I use the whole wheat organic you can use quinoa flour all sorts of flowers you know if you're worried about the gluten or anything like that so I'm just gonna mix it in the water I use a whisk here you want to be fairly thick check out a pancake yes so I'm just mixing that and then I'm going to and I've got a I've got some bread crumbs now I make my own whole-wheat bread crumbs I put in some onion garlic powder you can put in lottery salt if you if you want the sky's the limit as far as how you flavor your your breadcrumbs I use three pieces of bread sometimes I have extra bread crumbs I'll just put them in a ziplock and throw them in the freezer for next time I've got a couple of yellow onions I'm just gonna slice these into rings so when you slice one of the when you slice the onion and you push through it you'll have a bunch of rings like this and then they get smaller and I still use the ones that are in the middle so you've got these little ones in the you know at the very center you can sort of break them through get these little wrongs it's still fun I've got the oven warming up to 450 so yeah that's pretty much all ours to it just cut them you know half inch three-quarter inch whatever you prefer just push these through get them all into individual rooms I still use the smaller parts of the onion as well okay I've got these rings here now made up and we're going to dip them in this this is like a batter flour and water as I talked about and then bread them so I just got these tongs just throw something or you just throw some in the flour and water mixture just throw a bunch in there get those coated up and then I'll just put them in the flour mixture and just move them around it's covering them with some bread crumbs put them on I've got these two Silpat sheets show you those these are the ones I use for baking fries and all sorts of things the cauliflower wings just gonna leave behind a couple trays and take up a fair amount of room so just bread each one of these and I'm gonna bake these at 4/5 you know what these ones I'm only gonna bake them once I know some people were baking the cauliflower wings they just bake them once and then dip them in ranch dip or BBQ sauce that's fine these ones are just gonna be baked once they're pretty quick I'll probably try 20 minutes I'll let you know how long it took it depends on people's ovens and how much you have in there if you put it on the upper or lower rack stuff like that so I just checked on myself that the breading seems that they're crispy you don't want to burn obviously so so yeah I'll just keep doing this and then now we'll throw them any other I'll show you that / you guys I got a couple trays here I'm gonna slap these in the oven so I'm gonna do 450 and I'm gonna probably check 15 20 minutes I'll let you know how long it took now you just check after and see you don't just check them and make sure they're crispy enough so I can't give everybody exact times but these ones 15 15 or 20 minutes and probably do and I'll show you guys I'm gonna take them all in the oven talk to you later so I had these in they look really good I had them in for about 20 minutes or so I just check when they start to brown a little bit you can do a taste test if you want and one of the small ones it's a really good plane you can taste the the onion and the coating but you can also have ketchup you can make your own you can buy various ketchups and or whatever sauces you like some people use a ranch dip or barbecue sauce or something like that but I like to try I like to use ketchup so I just thought I'd show you this yeah and so the general idea is to you can coat a lot of things you can do zucchini you can even do potatoes but so basically you're coating it with the flour water mixture and then you're putting bread crumbs on top and there's other ways to do it gluten free there's other flours quinoa chickpea flour you can coat it in various things corn flakes some gluten-free breads and stuff like that so yeah hope you guys like this very similar to the cauliflower wing recipe and feel free to bread lots of other things that can make veggies nice and crispy I've seen people do Albanians as well if you like a lot you know jalapeno popper type thing so the crisp the branding just gives it a crispy texture and the baking is so much healthier than the typical french fries and onions that are deep fried in oil so hope you guys like that one to talk you later
