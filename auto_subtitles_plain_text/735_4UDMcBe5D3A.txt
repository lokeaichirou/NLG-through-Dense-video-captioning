 hello I'm Kevin Lang and a big night Entertainment Group and I'm here today I'm gonna show you how to make tuna sashimi sashimi is actually fairly fairly easy to do the biggest thing in the process is to really purchase the right fish generally your tuna is you would buy frozen a lot of people are surprised when they hear that about sushi and sashimi but that's actually a lot of the ways that it comes to sexually very safe in you know good for use but you really need to know how to treat the fish when you buy it so most of the time the fish you can get from your local fishmonger a lot of supermarkets will have what they call a Saku block which is generally a block like this you would buy the fish frozen it's usually cry of act and the real way to handle it is to let it thaw overnight under refrigeration so what you would do is usually leave it in the wrap or take it out wrap it neatly in a little paper towel put it on a plate and let that thaw overnight in the fridge so your finished product the next day should be a beautiful piece of fish like we have here this is a yellowfin tuna or pet dry very briefly and the biggest thing for people when they're doing this at home is make sure you buy the right product and then don't be scared don't be scared of the fish kind of have a little fun with it so here at Empire one of our restaurants we prepare this very simply served over a bed of ice which is a very traditional preparation you want to have soy ginger wasabi and like I said just don't be scared of the fish just have a little bit of fun with it nobody cuts it perfectly out of the gate a little bit of water usually on your knife helps you kind of helps your knife glide through the fish very easily you don't want to waterlog it and then it's simply slices got some nice pieces beautiful kind of color nice and lean set on top of our garnish then we serve with a little bit of a a little bit of soy sauce I am chef Kevin long with big night Entertainment Group and this is how you cut some beautiful tuna sashimi
