 colcannon a very famous traditional Irish potato and cabbage recipe traditionally served around Christmas time so we'll kick off by preparing the cabbage i'm using sweetheart cabbage today which is this shape cabbage not as fibrous as your coleslaw cabbage one of my favorites to use justly to finally shred that and then a big patch of steaming mashed potatoes so I've already seemed my potatoes I've used rooster potatoes for the mesh so they're just busy drying out the more they dry out the fluffy of the mash is that we're going to have some start off by just gently stir frying and brazing and my final shredded up my finely shredded sweetheart cabbage there's a tongue twister so lots of butter mount that down oh it says losses all and to this we're going to add our finally shredded sweetheart cabbage trying as much into the pan there that's as much as I'm going to be able to squash in and then I had a very unusual ingredient that I use for my fried cabbage that goes into my car canon and that is a couple of tablespoons of strong tea so make yourself a mug of tea and just splash in a cup of tablespoons of the team here creating all their skin and what that does that raises the cabbage the braising is a cooking method we're buying you fry a vegetable or piece of meat with oil or butter and you ever liquid to it so that works really really well for something a cabbage that's really fibrous so you could use any cabbage for this it's a boy cabbage a regular white coleslaw cabbage I've just chosen to use a sweetheart cabbage one of my favorites so it's up to you how crunch your cabbage is going to be you can lightly stir fry it at the point or you can carry and cook into a little bit softer I think for canon it's nice to have a slightly softer cabbage so the tea is going to add a lovely warm nutty taste to the cabbage and when Ed's plenty of black pepper black pepper and braised cabbage go really really well together so while that's cooking away in doing the things you already see it's reduced down moisture is coming out of it and it's braising down that nicely is we're going to make our mashed potato so a couple of tips for good mashed potato ideally steam your potatoes i use reis / tato so there is licensed floppy as possible I listened to drain in a colander so some of the moisture is going to evaporate and in this patch I've heated up butter and creme fraiche so any liquid you using needs to be piping hot before adding to the potato if you don't make sure it's piping hot the potato will have this really weird glue-like consistency like carpentry view it's really really not nice so I've used a creme fraiche which is a sour cream but it's nice and thick lots of salt and black pepper add a little bit more I should have come to my cabbage while I'm here lots of black pepper and now it's just a little bit of elbow grease now you need to make sure that your potatoes are piping hot still when you're mashing them otherwise they go gray and it doesn't really affect the flavor but it just doesn't look very nice so mash mash mash it's better to either use potato masher or do it by hand as im doing it I find a food processor and this you've got the right blade and you're doing it very very carefully can actually give a strange texture to the mesh you can get a volunteer to help you with us if you want to but that's lovely light fluffy mash it's still creamy so it's nice balance of textures my cabbage is looking great multi-tasker a little bit see all the t's evaporated it's done its job it steamed the cabbage a little would continue mashing so we're going to mix the two of these together and colcannon it's a traditional Halloween dish so you can serve it as a side dish for almost anything go is particularly well with pork dishes and chicken dishes and really any casseroles do the Cabbage just adds a little bit of something extra special so this should be smooth and lump free it's important at this point just check for the seasoning it's lovely a little bit nicer you think it's quite creamy and last little mesh you can see this little steaming hot so that will give us really light fluffy mesh so my cabbage is perfect all the t's evaporated and start to get slightly brown and crispy on the outside so we good with that what am I measure now I'm sitting looking forward to this and that even looks really attractive on a table fluffy creamy mash with a green of the cabbage so scoop this out into a big serving dish go excellent don't leave anything behind maybe a little bit for the chef to mop up click the blast or mix and there we go Queenie co.cavan mesh
