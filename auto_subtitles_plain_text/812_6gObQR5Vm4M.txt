 hey guys it's Lauren and I finally have the sauerkraut video for you today so I'll show you how quick and easy it is to make your own homemade sauerkraut okay so the first thing you'll need to do for making your sauerkraut is get out everything that you need and first you'll need your cabbage so that I'm using a green cabbage today and then we have caraway seeds they're sort of they look and smell kind of like cumin seeds and then sea salt and then a quart-size mason jar with a lid and this one I actually have leftover brine from my last batch which you can reuse and it's actually helpful to reuse your leftover liquid from your last batch because there's already that that lactobacillus bacteria in there and so it helps the fermentation process go a little bit faster in your next batch because it's already cultivated and then the other thing you'll need is a bowl to put this in you want like a good wide bowl because you're gonna have both your bins in there massaging so you want to have a lot of space to move around the only other thing you'll need is a little like piece of tape or some kind of label to use to label the lid and we'll put the date that you started your batch on the lid so that you can keep track of how long it's been sitting out or how old it is after you've put it in the fridge so we'll start off by taking a little piece of cabbage off of the top because we'll be using it later when we get everything in our jar so I'm just gonna it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be pretty but you just peel off this top leave and you can just put that to the side okay and then we basically just want to take the core out of our cabbage and start shredding it up and you can either use a food processor for this or you can use your knife to cut this into the shreds and I've done it both ways and when I use the food processor I find that it makes a lot smaller pieces and when I do it the knife I can I can control the size of the pieces better and I can make it so that I get like longer longer slices longer shreds of the cabbage and after doing that I find that I like the texture of the longer shreds and so I'm gonna cut this up with a knife and just cut it into nice thin slices and you can cut up up into whatever size pieces you want but the smaller the better because that's what's gonna give you that sauerkraut texture and it's going to ferment faster and it's going to help the process of giving the water the liquid out of it so that you have you create your brine for the sauerkraut process so I'm gonna go ahead and cut this up okay so we have the cabbage all shredded up here into nice thin slices just how I wanted them and you'll see that this takes up pretty much the whole bowl right now but what we'll do next is add our caraway seeds and our salt and we'll mix that in and then we'll let it sit for like thirty minutes to an hour and what will happen is that the cabbage will begin to wilt because both the caraway seeds and the salt help to draw out the moisture from the cabbage and then at that point we'll start to massage it and that'll bring out more of the juice more the moisture and then we will have our brine for our fermentation process so we'll just do a tablespoon of the caraway seeds and then I have two tablespoons of sea salt ground up and then just lightly incorporating that trying to sort of spread it throughout all of the cabbage and it's fine if it doesn't reach all of it just to help the wilting process we want it to come in contact with as much of the cabbage as possible and like I said the bigger the bowl the better she'll have more room to play with here and you could even divide this up between two different bowls if you wanted all right so we have let our cabbage sit with the salt and caraway seeds for about an hour now and you can see it's it's gone down about a third so we're just going to start massaging it now so getting your hands right in there and just basically squeezing the cabbage and what we're trying to do here is work out some of that liquid some of the juice from the cabbage and wilt the cabbage a little more and this is going to get a lot smaller and so much moisture will come out that will actually be able to put this in our quart sized jar and it will be covered in its own liquid or its own brine so I've been massaging this for just a few minutes and you can see there's a good amount of liquid that's come out already just from a few minutes of massaging after we let it wilt with the salt in the caraway seeds so this is about halfway there you can see the cabbage is really getting wilty it almost kind of looks a mushy and so we just want to massage this a little bit more all right so I've got the cabbage all massaged and there's quite a bit of liquid in here might be able to see that and definitely is covering the top of the cabbage so I'm going to transfer it to my mason jar which already has some of that leftover brine in it I'm gonna start by just spooning in some cabbage with a big spoon and if you got a particularly large cabbage you may need to use another small jar which is totally fine it doesn't really matter how many jars it takes okay so I have my cabbage and brine packed in here you want to just you can use your hand or you can get like a pounder and just try and pack it all down to the bottom so that the water rises up and covers the top and then from here you want to get that cabbage leaf that you took off in the beginning before you shredded your cabbage you just want to get a piece or two big enough to cover the top of your cabbage inside your jar and then this actually stays down there really good on its own this is basically to keep any couch from rising to the top and being exposed to the air because that can can allow it to grow a mold and you don't really want it to do that you want to keep it submerged underneath the brine and so this is actually staying down just fine on its own but you can also use something of weight like you can put like large stones on top of the cabbage leaf or I've even used the sharp glass before that I use for like my wheatgrass and I just stick the shot glass in there and then screw the cap on and it gives enough pressure that it keeps the cabbage leaf down there and then we'll just screw the lid on you want to have a good you know inch or so at the top left of space for the air to be because air will be coming up from the bottom as it ferment so you want some place for that to go so you don't have an exploding glass jar and so the last thing that you want to do is label the top of the jar with some kind of label or tape with the date that you started this batch that you actually screw the top on and set it on the counter okay so we have our cabbage packed in here and our cabbage leaf on top and our weight on top on our lid on tie it with the date marked on there and now we just want to sit it out on the counter for three to four days and that's why we label it with the date so that we can reference that to see when it's time to take it off of the counter and put it into the fridge so after three or four days sticking it into the fridge and then you can just leave it there indefinitely and this stuff will last pretty much forever because the process of fermentation is actually a preservative method and that was was one of the main reasons why it was used in in cultures originally was to preserve vegetables so I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you have tons of fun making your own homemade sauerkraut and I would love to hear how your recipes turn out and I will post more videos of fermented veggies and kimchi and maybe even some fermented beverages so until next time thanks for watching
