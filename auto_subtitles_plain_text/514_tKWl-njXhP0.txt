 hi I'm Susan Sadie welcome to Susan's cooking school today we'll be making pierogi let's make our para you go here I have my flour I'm going to add salt stir it in I'm going to take my eggs and add them to my water this helps to get the eggs evenly distributed in a job gradually add the egg mixture while stirring with a fork I just keep tossing to incorporate the ingredients makes it a little easier when you go to need it I'm going to start to bring this dough together with my hands and as I do so I'll be able to tell if it's going to be too dry or too moist if it feels too dry to me this is the time to add a little extra water and if it feels too moist it'd be the time to add a little more flour feels pretty good after I have all the ingredients incorporated then I'm going to put it on the table and eat it dump this on the table now I'm going to knead this for about a minute as I'm kneading it I'll pick up the bits or flour and dough that are on the table we don't need to over knead this dough just need to make sure that it's nice and smooth and even usually a minute does it I just kind of pushing the doll back and forth and putting my body weight behind it helps to bring it all together so it feels pretty smooth and pretty even I don't feel any lumps in there but now it needs to sit and rest before we roll it out so just going to cover this with a little flour put a piece of plastic over it and let it sit for about 15 minutes and then we ready to use our dough is ready to go we've rested it I'm going to take about half of it the other half aside keep it covered so it doesn't dry out I'll put a little flour on my table press the dough out with my fingertips give it a head start I keep flouring it to make sure that it's not going to be sticking to my table lower the top we can brush off the excess flour later on now I'm going to roll good to roll from the center out and keep checking that it's not sticking to the counter keep putting a little flour underneath it okay it's nice and even it's fairly thin it's about maybe an eighth of an inch or so I'm going to take my cutter cut circles I'll take my scraps of dough which can be reused smush them together and I'm just going to put them on the backside of the dough that we have saved from before we'll begin with our potato cheese and our filling is nice and cold and you can see that it's pretty firmed up I'm using a 3/4 ounce Disher and I'm going to put one scoop on each dough now we're going to shape these I take 1 basically I'm going to stretch the filling over the dome so I'm going to push down the filling push the dough up and over and then seal it at the top first and then I'm going to seal it other sides and I just pinch all along now that I've got it pretty sealed I'm going to make sure that it's very good at sealed and I'm going to squeeze really hard on this edge we just repeat that process again take the pirogue in one hand sort of push down and pull up the dough around the filling squeeze at the top making sure that I don't have any filling in there and then pinching tight and with experience you'll be able to do these faster and faster okay these are ready to be boiled make sure you have a large pot with a lot of water because if the pierogi are too crowded and the water takes too long to come back to a boil they're not going to come out as good so just drop your peril be and one by one you give it a stir once with a wooden spoon to make sure that they're not sticking to the bottom and then it takes about three minutes for them to be done the pair of you when they're just about done should be all floating to the surface as they are and the water should be vigorously boiling okay so we'll remove these now I have over here a tray that I just put some oil on I'm just going to scoop these out and put them on the tray let them get nice and coated with a thin coating of oil so help prevent them from sticking even though these priv are ready to be now you can eat them just like they are you can put some butter on them but we're going to pry them up going to serve them with some sauteed onions &amp; sour cream I think our butter is ready I'm going to add our potato and cheese therapy and sauerkraut the bottom of the pants put this over somewhat medium gauge keep it cool sign them because you don't want to burn okay those are ground on one side the side a little bit and I'm going to add some onions character oh you look just about them they are pierogi are ready now we'll just plate them out arrange them around some sour cream that I have on this plate with a little parsley on top I'll put three potato and cheese and through sauerkraut mushroom and now we'll take some of these onions that we made and just sprinkle them around they're ready to be served I hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching you
