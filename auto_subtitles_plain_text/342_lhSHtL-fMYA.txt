 today I'm going to be cooking one of my all-time favorite Korean dishes top galbi and we realize that we've actually never done like a restaurant review of taco Lu before that's because once I learned how to make this at home I just never went out to eat it again you know if you can cook at home without any pants on that's like the best thing isn't it are you writing pants today no this recipe seems complicated because I have like a gazillion ingredients but it's really just building the sauce and the sauce is just like unceremoniously dumped into a bowl I usually just make the sauce in like a huge vat and I keep in a jar in the fridge and it holds forever and then when you want to cook it you just add the chicken and the fresh ingredients today I'll make a small version so that you guys can follow along at home alright let's build the sauce I'm starting out with my secret ingredient which is adding Korean style curry to this mix now when you think a curry you might be thinking of like an Indian curry or Indonesian curry you want like the yellow curry I have no other way to explain this to you so I'm using the ones that are kind of already in a bouillon pack if you can't find the Korean kind you can actually use the Japanese one as well I've used both and they work just fine and we're gonna add half a cup of hot water to this and just let mash around while I'm getting other stuff together if you're using fresh ginger you don't have to do this but I'm doing these like really cool rehydration cubes this makes me feel like I live in the future look at them when awesome so it's like fresh ginger but they've been dehydrated into little cube formats it's gonna rehydrate them in their go rehydrate my pretties get yourself a big bowl for mixing the marinade in I've already put in my minced garlic and I'm gonna just dump in all the curry that I already have in here with the garlic and I'm gonna start adding everything to this as well this is a great leg I just put in bold part I'm adding the gochugaru which no you handout replaces like a chili powder or a paprika this is like a korean-style red pepper flake so it has a very specific taste to it that I can't explain since I'm and I like it really hot I bought the extra very spicy red pepper powder but you can get the normal one as well oh yeah we're gonna be partnered one and a half you can do two tablespoons if you want but I like the flavor of it a quarter teaspoon of black pepper one of my all-time favorite Korean words you remember what the word is Simon Koo Chi Chi funny story about who chew when Simon and I were teaching we showed our students Twilight and is a part where Bella's dad asks her if she needs pepper spray and the kids didn't understand what that was so someone was like okay it's kind of like you take goichi which means like pepper I need like kind of shake it and then you spray it in someone's eyes but then he realized that Gocha was a slang word for penis so he basically told the students to take a penis and shake and spray at someone's eyes but luckily they were too innocent to understand it and Simon doe for his cell phone and called me immediately was like two arms when does your school schools work this is June and then I used to she wouldn't was fine penis also go to add an half a teaspoon of salt boom boom yes I keep my salt in a strawberry jar which I can imagine is confusing for some people just in case we have some robbers that come here and they want to steal our selves in a thoroughly confused eerie confused I'm may adding an extra tablespoon of the curry powder this is oh no it's one of these adding in a tablespoon of soy sauce I'm adding in two tablespoons of mirin just like a Japanese sweet rice wine I don't know how to explain it someone explain it for me mirin the old lady actress that won the Oscar Helen Mirren yeah yep they just condensed all of her tears and sweat into a bottle and it's really popular in Japan yep I'm adding two teaspoons of sesame oil you have to use sesame oil because it has a flavor and I'm gonna add a tablespoon of honey and then the most important ingredient gochujang okay we're doing one and a half to two depending on how you're feeling yes I am wearing a single for this look at that hmm grab chicken that I've already sliced up into strips just dump it in here to soak for a bit mom chicken we're gonna let this soak and then we are going to move on to another part of the day on to stage two why your chicken is just soaking if you do have sweet potatoes you're going to need to get started on cooking these because it takes a while for them to soften up open these guys in and I'm going to add a little bit of cabbage just so that we have a little bit of water action happening in there and I'm popping a little now while that is steaming we're gonna start soaking our here okay I'm going to add the green onions Wow I kind of missed a piece this one's for you Simon ah hey now you're not trying to brown all that stuff you're just trying to kind of like soften it we're going to add in all of our chicken and everything now I know some people like so just overnight and everything but I found no difference I tried both versions oh yeah already and I'm gonna add to the rest of my cabbage boom the cabbage is really important for adding moisture to the fish guys just make sure everything is nicely coated yup and I'm gonna flatten it down okay damn yep and I'm just gonna let this steam for a bit I'm gonna put on the timer for about 8 to 10 minutes this entire meal is pretty much done within 15 minutes what kind of timer do you have Karen are you a professional chef why are using a bear timer that's professional it's counting down that's its job timer complete judgements five minutes has gone by I'm gonna add a little bit of water to this we're just gonna add about a quarter cup we're gonna add duck soon and I want to make sure there's enough liquid in here so the dog has something to absorb gonna drain off the water it and I'm going to just add on top now my mushrooms and now I'm going to add in the Korean sesame leaves on top of this if you can't find this you can actually use basil instead guys come on over here I have this little tiny garden it's like a robot Morgan I think you guys saw on Instagram I talked about it a little bit it's called clicking grow you literally put in this little like cartridge with the seeds in it just dump in water and plug it in and we left for Japan and then when I came back three weeks later I had old basil it's awesome and it's a really nice match for technologies I've also to be adding cheese so I kind of chooses a pizza cheese you're looking for like the lowest quality meltable mozzarella cheese not anything high quality I killed the heat before I added in the basil I'm just gonna sprinkle this all over with my delicious baked cheese and then put the lid on it okay let's leave it there for a bit and then we can get ready for the wrapping part I don't mean hip-hop wrapping I mean lettuce shouldn't I be doing this part of the video no it's fine you just stay there but I was really in it I'm gonna grab a little bit of lettuce here and I'm gonna add a little bit of MU this is like a pickled daikon radish oh yeah that's how's it taste so what you're saying is you feel like you shouldn't eat any more in the rest should be decided by God oh my I totally agree with you your first sentiment is your truest one I'm gonna have the rest myself yeah we're gonna draw my hand into it if you've
