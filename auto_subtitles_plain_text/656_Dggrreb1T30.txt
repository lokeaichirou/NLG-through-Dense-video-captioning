 hi everyone so this is my quick and easy shopper spy this is the ingredients you'll need frozen this time a better frozen from Tomatoes I usually get chopped tinned tomatoes but I haven't got any in so I just have to shut them out one onion a beef stock cube or a lamb stock cube two carrots some lamb mince this is no idea how much thin that all 500 grams and we've got 5 potatoes there there's white potatoes so first off I've peeled the potatoes cut them in half and then put them in some water to boil yeah until they're basically soft enough to mash so I've diced my onion and carrots very quite small I quite like them small they cook quicker as well I put a bit of olive oil in my pan I'm waiting that to warm up and then I'm going to add my carrots and onion and then sort of saute them to their source and soft just fertilizer the same time that's the laments so that salon minutes or ground off now I'm going to add the stock clear I'm basically just gonna crumble over the top it's just as extra flavor it's not necessary if you don't really want to but I finally just have the extra flavor without adding I'm salt and pepper I don't usually add salt and pepper to our meals mix that in so I've added the plum tomatoes I've actually cut them up while they're in here so yeah mix that in and let that bubbled away for a few minutes so I've lived it all simmer and reduced down for about 10 minutes it's been bubbling away just so it sort of thickens up now I'm going to add some peas so I'm just start to mash my potatoes I have picked in a spoonful of butter a spoonful of mayonnaise Hellmann's white and a little bit of pepper and a little bit salt so I'll sprinkle some cheese over the top and this has actually been in the fridge for about four hours because I didn't actually need to cook it straight away so now it's going in the oven at 180 degrees for 40 minutes
