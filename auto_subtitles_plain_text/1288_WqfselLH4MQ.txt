 good evening folks its Glenn the bowl chef tonight I'm going to put together my famous buffalo chicken wing recipe so I want to use back at the restaurant and we serve thousands and thousands of these wings they taste delicious with football season a bonus the great finger food for the game for picnic or whatever case you might have I'm going to show you how to put this classic easy recipe together in just a few steps so let me show you how we do it typically when you get your chicken wing you purchase it from the store it's got three stages to it the drum at the wing section and that what I guess is like the chicken toe or whatever it is that I cut right off there then I find the joint and that will produce the chicken wing and the chicken Dramat and what we'll do is we're going to put together order of about 20 of these so I'll repeat this process and prep up my chicken wings okay I've now cut up my 20 chicken wings into the drumettes into the wings sections as you can see I've used one night for that and traditionally buffalo wings are served with both celery and carrot sticks which I've chopped up these sticks using a completely different cutting board and completely different knife because I don't want any cross-contamination then what I typically do is I take my carrot sticks and my celery sticks and I put them into a water and ice bath just to basically crisping the sticks up while I'm cooking the wings and this this will just give them a nice little snap and the next step here is going to be to actually fry the chicken wings off so we're going to go to that next when it comes to chicken wings you'll see a lot of people either batter their chicken wings for the buffalo wings or they just fry them but you're kind of a little bit different twist on that for an order of 20 I will put in about a tablespoon of baking powder a teaspoon of crushed black pepper and three-quarters of a tablespoon of just regular sea salt and this basically coat these wings up they're not really battered but it basically gives them a nice Christmas and then I usually look just let these sit out for about 10-15 minutes so that I'm not filling them into the hot oil ice cold and we'll just let these sit out here fry sev about about 10 minutes get the oil up and I'll show you how to fry these off all right now what you want to do is take about 3 cups of cooking oil and you're going to put these chicken wings in here ah he doesn't want to do it to make sure why it took me a chicken wing stir these around a little bit so they don't stick together they don't stick to the bottom literally coated in the oil once we have these up the heat you have these sitting out for about 10-15 minutes they're not ice cold and you see the oil really hasn't stopped but we want to make sure that we bring that oil back up the heat once we have a boil back up to the high then we want to cut it back to about medium-high so that we thoroughly cooked the wings throughout so you don't have rare centers on them very very cake yet cooking in a manner such that the exterior of the wing is nice and interesting what we're going to do now is we're going to prep up the sauce for the buffalo ways themselves need to start out with about a tablespoon of butter and this does make the wings just give them a nice soft taste to them now I mean there's a lot of different hot sauces you can use you can use Sorachi back the restaurant people want to tell these wings aren't hot enough I put some of this pier cap which has 500 Scoville units in it and I can just about knock somebody ad into the lead with this stuff that we're making this for probably normal guests and what I like to use is just Franks red hots this is just a nice hop off and I put in about tablespoons of that and give the vodka in here now do that I like to add some vinegar let's see tablespoon we want to cook that off so that we get rid of all the the acidity in the vinegar and to this mixture that that acidity is coming off of the sauce we're going to give this just the keys of cayenne just the back got all that vinegar off and then what we want to do is take these little Heinz tomato ketchup and I'll put about three tablespoons of that into the sauce throw that around something like that I'll hit it with a the wings you can be thoroughly careful and now with the force you get your wings thoroughly coated up I'll just you do then just play them up okay we've got our buffalo wings all plated up here we've got these served up with some blue cheese dressing you could also use ranch dressing whatever your taste preference says we've served them up with the traditional celebrated carrot sticks and they're now ready to serve you probably want to serve these with a small plate so that the people can put the wings onto the plate let's take one of these wings out here give it a try see how spicy it is nice crisp wing not too spicy I think it's just spot-on today the truth hits clean the ball chef thanks for watching and as always buon appetito
