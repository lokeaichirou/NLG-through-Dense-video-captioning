 hey guys Dave from cook and chair here and today we're making up a simple yet elegant little appetizer big muscles if you're a seafood lover you're going to love these so let's get started so what I have here is about half a kilo of mussels that I've washed and cleaned so what we're going to do is throw a lid on this and let it boil for iOS say about 2 or 3 minutes just until the shells begin to open now the mussels have cracked open what you want to do is take the top shell off and remove the beard of the mussel okay now what we're going to do is add two tablespoons of butter to a preheated pan and this is about medium heat add in about ten cloves of chopped garlic and we're going to stir and saute this just until it's soft and I would say this take a couple of minutes all right the scar looks looking pretty soft so now I'm going to add in about three tablespoons of panko breadcrumbs a pinch of salt and some ground black pepper and we're going to stir and saute this just to the point where as well combined so once you've done that go ahead and distribute your mussels on to a baking tray then spoon some of the garlic mixture over the top and if you have fairly large mussels I recommend you use those it just makes like a whole lot easier after you've done that go ahead and add your grated cheese over the top I'm using Monterey Jack here but you can use just about any kind of cheese you want actually I guess what you could do is make these up beforehand slip them into the fridge and just before your guests arrive pop them into the oven so they're nice and hot and fresh now we're going to slip these into 250 degree preheated oven and let the bake just until the cheese is melted this should take oh I'd say seven to ten minutes well the mussels are baking don't forget to click the subscribe button and never miss a video now the cheese is nicely melted and these look and smell fantastic we're going to sprinkle some fresh parsley over the top squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the top and you're ready to serve and there you have it our baked muscle these are succulent garlicky cheesy believe me guys if you're a seafood lover they make a great appetizer head on over to cook and chair comm for this recipe and many more great recipes and don't forget to click to subscribe and like our videos thanks for watching and see you next time
