 Nihal hello namaste Salaam walekum SATRA god welcome back to another session with your worship at Vericom today we are going to make another favorite dish for many Indians that is kung pao chicken combo got its name from a gentleman his name is ding ball he was from the stitch 1 province he was a head of particular region in honor of him they made this dish which is called Kung Pao you can make comp our vegetable cream puffs of chicken or shrimp or any other dish you like and whenever you heat the dish called Kung Pao you always find penis in it so today we are going to make chicken Kung Pao first let's make a concoction that we are going to make the sauce with so for this use around all 1 cup of chicken stock and add soya sauce to it it's very easy till you get a nice brown color to your liquid add little bit of pepper add around 2 tbsp of rice vinegar this is an optional ingredient you can add poison sauce just add 1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce pinch of ajinomoto pinch of sugar now this is an optional ingredient if you want to add nicely slit red chili you can add a little bit and if you want really hot you can add little bit of chili sauce too ok these things are optional now this mixture is ready to make our compasses after you mix all these ingredients taste liberal this will give you very good idea of how your sauce is going to be if you want a little bit heart make it a little bit hard if you want to add him it's more of soy sauce some hoisin sauce you can add to this so we're going to keep this aside okay now to the chicken add a little bit of soy sauce just a peg just to coat the chicken so that way it's easy to fry and a pinch of salt and mix all these ingredients add little bit of cornflour very little do not add too much little bit of cornflour and just mix it up so now that I've marinated this chicken with little bit soy sauce egg and salt and little confirm I mix all these ingredients we can use this by two methods one thing is you can add this chicken directly after you fry the red chillies ginger garlic to the mixture and then cook it but that way a lot of people do not know how to cook it properly they can mess it up that's why a lot of the times in the restaurant so we use a fine method because it's easy it's fast and you cannot go wrong with this so today we're going to show you how to use a frying method now thinking of frying a couple of people have asked me a couple of questions like when they made nuggies Ecostar they come to us who are getting stuck at the bottom and they were tearing open one very easy trick to fry anything very easily is use a nonstick kind of fine pan that way your meat will not get stuck at the bottom you will get the five product really good we can very easily separate this chicken by just taking two spoons just lifting it and just breaking off any of the pieces now remember do not fry it for long just cook it 3/4 and the rest of the puzzle we are going to cook in the sauce now the chicken is 3/4 cut I am going to remove this okay okay now the chicken is ready okay now if you have sesame seed oil you can use sesame seed oil otherwise you can use a regular corn oil for this cookin add red chili cut them into small pieces okay come pop you can add as much red chili as you want and make sure you cook til this red chili is dark brown that way the oil gets all the flavor of the shape see if you notice the color of the oil is also slightly getting little browner and that oil is extracting all the flavors from this red chili into the oil and that is passed on to your pop and when you heat it then you will get this real flavors actually getting nicely browned now add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger chop it really fine and it gives really nice flavor to your kabob ah you know a lot of times when we go and eat a Campari you know they add a lot of vegetables that couple of vegetables that enhances your convo for example you know adding nicely cubes of onion this is really good and do not forget to add nicely slices of chestnut just let these nice crunchy even after cooking it is nicely crunchy and make sure you add it but if you want to add the mushrooms bell pepper baby corns and this is a little bit of celery you can add any vegetables you want carrots or anything so I'm going to add these here now bring in the sauce mixture that we mix earlier and add to this if you want your coupon to be dry add this sauce little less if you want it nice saucy with little bit of sauce that you want to eat it with rice and more of the sauce and you will get more gravy with your kung pao chicken okay you do not want to cook this sauce for a long time because you want your vegetable nice crunchy now you can add your chicken just to cook it for like few minutes and then add the main ingredient that's what gives the name Khun pop that is the peanuts here add the peanuts and do not forget you add host trick penis in this process if you are going to use raw peanuts use it after you add red chillies add the peanuts hiram otherwise you will get raw flavor so make sure you aren't ghost peanuts and then either spring onions or the green onions you may want to add a little bit salt depending I may want to add a little bit of salt if you're going to make it saucy just add a little bit of cornflour mixture okay that gives a nice consistency your sauce safe in few seconds your sauce is ready Wow look at this very nice sauce and your composition is ready isn't it beautiful look at the color you can the flavors ah my goodness beautiful beautiful now think about it dear
