 hi everyone welcome to Japanese cooking lovers this is Yuri today I will show you how to make miso soup miso soup is something that Japanese people eat every day and you may be able to find miso soup in Japanese restaurant in the United States but this is a little bit different because this is more of Ventech basically you can use any vegetables basic one is which means popular one is tofu and what comment which is seaweed and most likely you can see those ingredients one in Japanese restaurant but if you put more vegetables of course tastes much better so I'm going to use today yellow zucchini squash and onion and this is daikon radish I already peel and cut like half inch and of course miso and this is soup stock from Comfort and this is how I cut it those are daikon radish I peel like that and this is peeled and like 1/2 inch and sliced thin this is onion I do splice a thing and only unusually make soup taste sweeter and I like it very much I usually make any veggies same size because it's easy to pick up that way so let's see this is almost same size as some daikon radish I will use 3 cups of dashi today and you are going to boil this dashi stock ok it's boiling so I will put all those ingredients in here vegetable already cooked and I'm gonna put me so now but before I put missile I turn off heat why I am doing that because Mesa has very good scent and also flavor overcooked that's kill both of them so turn off the heat first then put me so I put me so this is about 1 tablespoon and 2 tablespoon and you just put me so in there and just leave it for a while and a mixes mix it later or use dose stuff and put miso in here and dumped in that miso soup in mixed with it in that is the other way to liquid for this up kind of solve it miso but if you don't have that that's fine just dump the miso inside and maybe 30-second me still gonna dissolve gently mix so you still have this one yeah when miso is dissolved this is the Mississippi and you taste it and if it's too weak put more miso and hopefully you don't put too much missile from beginning but if too strong which is too salty maybe you have to add more water or dashi stock so this is how to make authentic Japanese miso soup and basically you can use any vegetables from your refrigerator and I recommend mushroom mushrooms taste very good and also fried tofu which is very good and we don't call it's miso soup but we sometimes put pork and that is very good because of bad flavor but anyway this is how to make very authentic very good taste Japanese miso soup and I hope you enjoy this video and this is Japanese cooking lovers and this is Yuri thanks for watching
