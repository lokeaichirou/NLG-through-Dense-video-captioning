 hello and Happy Holidays I am Elise from the bee team and today I'm going to give you a tiny peek into my family's Christmas Eve traditions so we often celebrate some Polish traditions on Christmas Eve like sharing a plot key and Christi key and of course pierogies who doesn't love pierogies they are a Polish dumpling often stuffed with potatoes or with meat or sauerkraut and today we're making potato pierogies from scratch I'm gonna start by mixing the wet ingredients together in this large bowl I have two egg yolks 3/4 of a cup of sour cream I actually strained it to get any excess moisture out so we put it in a strainer over a bowl and put it in the fridge for maybe 20 minutes a little longer if you can and one stick of softened butter mix it all together now a little bit at a time I'm gonna start to add in the flour here on the side I have 2 cups of flour that I sifted and you don't want to add it all in at once because you may not have to use all of it getting to the point where I can really get rid of the spatula and I need to get in there with my hands so the pierogi dough has come together I formed it into a disc and I'm gonna cut it in half and wrap up each individual piece with saran wrap and put them in French well our Jo is made it's in the fridge it should be in there for at least 2 hours it can be in there for as long as 2 days luckily I made some last night so I'm ready to go just soften it up a little bit always rotate now we're just rolling the dough out and we're looking for it to be about 1/8 of an inch thick next step we're putting circles into the dough to make our pierogies so now we are stuffing our pierogies earlier I made this really delicious mashed potato mixture it also has mushrooms and spinach and thyme once the fillings in place I'm going to brush a little bit of this egg wash on just on half of the edge of the dough like so trying to get all the air out of there and finally fork it this entire pierogi recipe including the potato filling is available on Bobby Flay calm the pierogies are together they're ready to go into this pot of boiling water I'll put a few at a time after doing some testing we discovered that once you put them into the water and they rise to the top you have to time exactly four minutes and then get them out just so they don't overcook try to keep them away from each other and also from the sides of the pot now we're just going to lightly Brown each side in a pan with some butter and salt and pepper so let's top them with some caramelized onions and some fresh chopped parsley so there you have it forget those frozen pierogies at the store and make your own it tastes so much better and it's really pretty simple too as you saw
