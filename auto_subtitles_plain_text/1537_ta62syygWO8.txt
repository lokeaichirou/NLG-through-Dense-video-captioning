 hi guys welcome to Rajshri food this is the Bombay Chef Varna nom de and today I get to your kitchen a very simple traditional Caesar salad more for your lazy days for the Caesar salad let's first start making the croutons I have some bread here with me I love using white bread so I'm just cutting the sides off and then I'm cutting them into small cubes the size and shape of the crouton can vary as per your choice I love small cubes so I'm going with that traditionally you can also tear them you don't need to cut them you can just stare them at random and you can just use stone bread so yeah just cut these into these cubes so the first thing that goes is some olive oil in a pan some garlic and without it changing color the next thing that goes in is the bread cubes you have to toss this on very very very low flame but the idea is to make sure it is nice and roasted well you can also use a mixture of butter and oil but I love the taste of olive oil so trust me when it comes to this recipe stick to olive oil now that the croutons have become nice light and toasted I'm adding in some parsley finely chopped parsley little bit of black pepper so I'm just grating in some fresh parmesan on top of the croutons so that they become nice and cheesy and I'm not going to toast it any further and just want to give it a light toss and that's about it the flame goes off here you have some nice parmesan flavored croutons so now that these croutons are ready let's start making the dressing for the dressing I'm going to use some mayonnaise I'm using vegetarian mayonnaise which is made of soya next I'm adding in some salt freshly crushed black pepper finely chopped parsley and finely minced garlic the next that goes in is some Parmesan cheese lust goes in a tablespoon of chilled water what is very important in this recipe because that is actually want to make it like a thin flowy dressing otherwise this is a dressing made of mayonnaise which tends to become a little thick and cloggy water will just make it nice and flowy so there I go a quick mix there you have this beautiful Caesar dressing absolutely done and ready make sure when you're adding salt in this recipe it's to its absolute minimum and required quantity because parmesan also has solved so remember that now that the Caesar dressing is ready that's how the consistency should be nice light flowy yet a little thick but not very runny make sure so there you go let's start prepping the lettuce leaves so I have some cost lettuce here which I have reserved in some chilled water I'm going to take this bulb of romaine lettuce which is also known as cost lettuce and if you see it's nice crunchy and crisp because I've reserved it in chilled water I'm just want to cut a few inches from the base I'm just going to release all the leaves like so you'll see there's a scent of stock which needs to be removed and all these leaves I'm just bundling them up together I'm just going to roughly run a knife through this just make sure it gets cut just make sure all the lettuce has been cut you can just hand snip a few if you want to avoid the knife completely you can just stare it at random with your hands just taking your tossing bowl adding in some croutons nice light and crisp adding in cut lettuce leaves just grating in some fresh Parmesan cheese once the parmesan is done just giving it a light toss there you have these leaves beautifully mixing with the Parmesan cheese and the croutons there you go I have a beautiful salad bowl all of this now goes in this salad bowl topped with some croutons dressed with some beautiful Caesar dressing so I'm just chopping a little bit of this on the salad a little more Parmesan cheese and there you have this wonderful salad for the lazy's on a lazy afternoon so here you have a traditional and healthy Caesar salad do try it at home and do not forget to catch me 2nd of March onwards on get carried
