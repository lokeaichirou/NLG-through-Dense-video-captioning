 well everybody loves buffalo wings party wings hot wings they're so popular now that they're actually more expensive than boneless skinless chicken breasts and that's why you see boneless skinless wings at a lot of places all the bars and restaurants and fast food places are selling chicken wings and they have become one of the most expensive parts of the chicken obviously you've heard me before I'm going to tell you go to Costco they're the cheapest wings interestingly you may find frozen wings in the bag uncooked but broken down and completely ready for you to cook for less expensive than the fresh wings but which is interesting because usually the more process something is the more expensive it is in this case we found a great deal on the whole uncooked wings and the first thing you need to do is take these things apart so it's really pretty easy one cut down by the skin pop it open and you can see the joint and then straight through the joint you're never ever cutting through bone the wingtip same thing here you do sort of have to go right through it save those wing tips for soup okay they are very very valuable okay so there I've got the wings that was about 15 of them that I cut up sort of laborious and a bit of a pain but it's always better if you do this stuff yourself now we're going to season them and here's the thing we're not going to deep-fry these the way traditional buffalo wings are those are the best and there's no denying that's the way to do them but a lot of people don't have deep fryers we're going to try to do these in the oven the problem with doing them in the oven is they don't get crisp well if you read around the internet and all those other cool places where they have recipes they've come up with a way to keep these things crispy in the oven we're going to test it out and see if it works so first we need to make a seasoning mix and for the seasoning mix I'm going to make I'm going to use a couple of tablespoons of my seasoned salt mix which again as I've said before the recipes on the web if you don't feel like making it yourself is he happy to sell you some a couple of tablespoons of the pepper and instead of a lot of other seasonings they tell you to put baking powder because baking powder they say crisps up the wings I don't know if it does but we're going to add about two tablespoons to the mix and mix it up thoroughly and really get it into the wings we're going to sort of rub it in so all the ways are thoroughly coated with this mixture okay it looks fantastic but there's one more thing we need to do before we make them this is why I hope you're not watching this the morning of Super Bowl Sunday these things have to sit and dry in the refrigerator for a day that's going to help keep the skin very very crispy we're going to set him out on a tray put them in the fridge and let them dry overnight well as you can see the wings have been drying overnight they've got a nice dry texture the skin is dried out a lot we rubbed them with the seasonings and the baking powder to make them get crispy at least in theory and now we're going to put them in a 400 degree oven total cooking time is going to be probably about 45 minutes but I'm going to check them after about 20 25 minutes and flip them over the other thing to know is that I put the oven rack all the way up as high as it will go so that I can get a lot of radiated heat from the top of the oven so it's almost more like a broiler we'll see if that works so now into the oven for the first 25 minutes I've got these out of the oven now and they're actually turning a rather nice color I'm going to flip them all over so they get a chance to sort of base themselves with whatever fat they have under the skin that's rendering out now these may stick a little bit just move them a little bit on the rack and they should come off fairly easy well I will say they look pretty good and they're smelling really really good but now back into the oven for another 20 25 minutes well it's been about 25 extra minutes say these things look really really good they're not tremendously dark in color but they do have a very firm crispy feeling skin so I think we may have accomplished our goal of getting crispy wings out of the oven instead of deep-frying them I have here the most typical brand of hot sauce that's used for these wings it's probably the most authentic and I have a bat in this little cup I have about a quarter cup of melted butter too which I'm going to add about a half a cup of hot sauce I've got a nice big bowl here I'm going to put my sauce into it and I'm not going to Saul Saul the wings because the boys are going to come home and they're not going to want sauce let's take I don't know doesn't it a half or so and just shake them through the sauce you can hear how crispy they are there you have it some very crispy very tasty oven fried buffalo wings
