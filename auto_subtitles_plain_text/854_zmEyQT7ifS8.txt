 [Music] it's all the menus of most of the restaurants in the world and it's a popular lunchtime classic what would you say if I told you we were going to do the ultimate version of a chicken Caesar salad a tech can't wait and that's what I'm going to do good we're going to make it ultimate by poaching our chicken we're going to make a homemade Caesar dressing we can do all these things pictures on the vine crouton season with five different flavorings and I think the best part a Parmesan cheese basket this doesn't sound like your ordinary chicken Caesar salad no it's ultimate and it starts with our chicken so one chicken breast and we're going to put that into a pan of boiling water but as soon as it goes in turn the heat off why and then let it poach about ten minutes because then it'll be slightly less than boiling which keeps it really moist and succulent yeah I'm just cooking a temperature to get so nice and cool and cooler but it cooked chicken through later on we take out slicing and Charma okay so if you can do that yeah over here I have got a chunk of parmesan and I think this is the best part it's now parmesan Boston what I'm doing is great it's nice and fine grate it into a large disc and then just going to tidy up the edges those bits will burn otherwise so it's gonna be a bomb how do we get the motion that becomes later on so this is gonna go to another yeah 180 degrees Celsius for four minutes till it's molten the kind of bubbling and a little bit golden then as it comes out it gets draped over a bowl upside down so it's an inverted Bowl and it cools it on the guy's brittle McEachern out okay so they can go into another next up our croutons we've got one ciabatta loaf and Jamie if you can slice that in two pieces they're gonna be long gyah better kind of croutons rather than square ones and to it I'm going to add five different flavors salt pepper dried thyme dried oregano and garlic powder and mix all of those together scatter them over arch your back to with a good reserve oil and they can go into the oven alongside of Hamza Chris hmm at this stage you've gotta be careful it's really really off motion shitty set so just lift it over bowl and give it about 10 15 seconds and then hopefully we can take it off and turn over we have our very own bowl to survive Caesar salad yeah that that is what makes this thing Ottoman without them with us salad will be accordingly the dressing now you can buy that but that's not very Altimas this is open for making your own when you use two different types of oil the egg and in flavor it with and chipping Parmesan pasta sauce Wow okay just start without we need just an egg yolk basically to make a mayonnaise so separate out an egg yep you're gonna get all the whiskey that goes in there the red machines from Albion's ultimate would stink you are the optional ice-cream machine to it we add a dash of white wine vinegar a pinch of salt and pepper some vegetable oil okay and then also later on we're going to do rapeseed oil about half Beach okay so it's not too golden what quite a payoff dressing for this that's already four so as you dribble in the oil really really slowly what will happen is the oil and the egg helped just kind of multiply and you get a thickening I love it when you talk about science Italy don't get a science but it's also love its ultimate but if you are looking for other healthy salads on the field good food series we've done ones like there's a watermelon salad the choosing Aswath there was a lobster tail salad was amazing I was all just incredible you're looking for healthy I'd head that direction as soon as you're happy you've got the consistency of mayonnaise it's now time to season it obvious already got salt and pepper and vinegar but now which just saw some good splash off yeah for saltiness and creaminess some grated Parmesan and that is too thick to be a Caesar dressing so a splash of warm water as you is and that's the kind of thing you'd find in a bottle from the supermarket except this one Jamie is ultimate next up our salad we're going to take a little gem lettuce if you can just plug the leaves you want to keep them pretty much whole because they're beautiful it leaves if you also taste all these cherry tomatoes and just pop them off the vine yeah amazing if you can buy two Tomas on the vine do so they have so much better flavor while you're doing that I'm going to slice up a red onion keeping the pieces nice and fine you don't onion to overpower the rest the flavor especially as we're keeping it warm and now to cha our chicken so hopefully poached perfectly look at that in the middle they're cooked away through but never overcook doesn't dry out there's nothing worse when you buy salad it charred on the grill for 20 minutes or so the outside is so dry in order to cook it all the way through that is what's going to happen here it's just a go always I can feel that heat from here and it it's already cooked so this is purely for decoration and for a video extra flavor because it's ultimate and now to dress the salad so it looks as good as it's going to taste the parmesan basket on the face and plenty of our little gem lettuce on top dress that with our Caesar dressing and then Jamie with the cherry tomatoes now I actually remember Lydia has just done a video of dating dilemmas where she said that chicken Caesar salad was the ultimate first date meal and why is that when she said it was because it was light it's not messy it tastes good and you look good whilst you're eating it droops will always be better who comes first for you doesn't it always always why would you change yourself for somebody else if it's this ultimate Caesar salad I change to maybe that's different we go more dressing more layers of tomato we put our onion on there as well now I'm going to grab the chicken so get plenty of that on top of there every stage of the process is better than anything you would get anywhere else look at these these are fresh straight out of the deli counter already marinated but fresh anchovies use we've got a little bit in our dressing already but a couple of those on top more dressing grab just two croutons jm8 plenty of seasoning and spice in those five different things but that is I think the ultimate chicken Caesar salad Jamie won't have to do stuck in ok it looks fresh and vibrant logon sets the healthy side me well with all that cheese basket but well it's really worth the extra effort but every single piece has had their that take some quickly as we said at the start season as you can pretty much get everywhere and yet this one hoping we gets put down in front someone with Parmesan basket you get the wow factor as well on that why this one's ultimate now
