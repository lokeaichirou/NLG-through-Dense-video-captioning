 hi everyone today we're making an authentic German dish of German style sauerkraut with grilled bratwurst on top okay for today's dish we need three fresh bratwursts one jar of sauerkraut and some olive oil we'll be using 1/2 cup of chopped onion and also about the same amount of chopped apple 1 garlic clove minced a few juniper berries and 1 whole bay leaf to start with we're going to prep our apple you're only going to need about half of it so what we want to do is then peel it well once our apple is peeled half of it we want to go ahead and just kind of give it a coarse chop so in a medium pot we want to put it on medium to high heat and add our olive oil just a little bit in there to coat the onions when we add them let that heat up so now we'll add our onions once the onion nice and tender we're going to go ahead and add our apples that we chopped up and our minced garlic coz they add that all together let those soften up a bit now what we want to do is add the whole jar of sauerkraut including the liquid with a fork we're going to let this cook for a few minutes bringing the heat up just a tad just to get everything in here nice and warm okay once our sauerkraut mixture is warm through but not yet boiling what we want to do then is add just a little bit more water probably about a quarter to a half a cup our juniper berries a good pinch of salt and our bay leaf and we're going to kind of mix that in there and what we want to do now is lower the heat cover and we're going to cook this for about half an hour to an hour all right in another pot a little larger one I put some cold water and I'm going to boil it and what I'm going to do this is a technique I like to do takes the guesswork out of cooking the bratwurst if you boil them just on a light boil that cook through and then there's no guesswork when you're frying them up in a pan on our kraut that's simmering at low heat we want to check on it here from time to time and make sure it's got enough liquid in there you can always add a little more water if it looks like it's starting to dry out but this one really really tasty and it smells wonderful so we'll let that go for another 15 minutes or so okay once I brought worse sar they've been boiling now for just a few minutes just so you can see that they get cooked through you want to go ahead and turn off the heat and what we're going to do is just put them on a plate and set the side all right now we're going to check on our sauerkraut looking good it still has plenty of liquid it's still simmering on low heat we're going to let that cook for another 10 or so minutes I want a separate skillet we're going to heat up some butter and a little bit of olive oil to that just to keep the butter from burning let that warm up nice and evenly here kind of distribute the butter in the oil okay this is on medium to high a little more towards the high heat level butter is nice and melted and we're going to go ahead and add our bratwurst and start to brown them now that's why I boiled them before or parboil them so that I know that the center is cooked pretty much and that we don't have to worry about these things getting really black and the insides are all pink and uncooked you'll notice from the natural casing some liquid skin started fine you want to do is start to lightly brown its kind of turn them let them go on the other side there's it you're going to go ahead and turn the flame off on the sauerkraut so this is a nice and done cooking for about 45 minutes and we're going to shut the heat off and keep it covered just to keep it warm set it aside all right I brought we look like they're beautifully browned and ready to be served up so here we go okay so using a slotted spoon we're going to plate up a nice platter of this beautiful sauerkraut and when you find the Bailey if you definitely want to remove it and we this smells so good then we're going to add our bratwurst just lay them right on top this is a beautiful traditional German dish at the end I like to garnish it with a little bit of flat-leaf parsley finely chopped yummy and here we have our German style sauerkraut with bratwurst delicious
