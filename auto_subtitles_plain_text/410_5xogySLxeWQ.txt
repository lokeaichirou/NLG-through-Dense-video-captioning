do just about anything to avoid eating it Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes have always been some of my favorites I was always picking around the Savoy which is basically a big parsley salad refusing to be beaten by an herb I started making my own Jubilee and now I love it so much I make it every week when the ingredients are in season it's quick its affordable and it's a healthy vegetarian side dish which makes it perfect for picnics trips to the beach to barbecues so I figured it was time to share my Jubilee recipe with you this week on working class foodies tabbouleh recipes vary from country to country in the Middle East but they all contain two key components cracked bulgur wheat and parsley tabbouleh salads are seasoned with lemon juice and olive oil and varying amounts of mint and it can be beefed up with tomatoes cucumbers green peppers or scallions it's become a well-known dish in America where we generally scoop it up with pita bread or use it as a filling of falafel sandwiches but historically tabbouleh scooped up with leaves of romaine lettuce and there are a few different ways to make the bulgur for the tabbouleh and some versions you soak the grain and water for hours and hours and others you simply soak it for a few minutes and I'm laborious they squeeze it dry and paper towels my immersion kind of splits the difference now the most important thing when you're making tabbouleh is that your herbs are fresh and as vibrant as possible either harvest them directly from your garden or window box and use them right away or look for herbs that are bright green with strong stems the farmers market and use them within one day of purchase to make Mike tabbouleh I start by pulling a cup and a half of boiling water over one cup of bulgur in a heatproof Bowl cover the bowl and set it aside for 30 minutes traditionally tabbouleh is made with spring onions or scallions well I like mine with a little fresh garlic as well and I add half of the white onion left over from another recipe that I needed to use up basically you can use any onion variety you like best or whatever you have on hand the key is to chop the vegetables as finely as possible like between the smoothness of a pesto and the chunkiness of a salsa you can do it by hand but if you've got a food processor it'll save you a ton of time so while my bulgur was soaking I have a global garlic and quartered my leftover onion then I cord and quartered a medium-sized vine tomato and put it all into my food processor I seasoned it liberally with salt and black pepper remember your bulgur is on season and I also like to add a little dash of crushed red pepper flakes for a mild kick and pulse until everything is uniformly chopped at this point if it's been 30 minutes check on your bulgur it should have absorbed most of the water by now and have an al dente like to slimness if you like your boat or softer move it to the fridge and let it soak in there cover it for another hour if you're like me and you like to be a little bit chewy let it sit while you finish prepping yours next I finly sliced 2 scallions up to the dark green and then I prepped my parsley hold a bunch of rinsed and dried parsley in your hands and run the blade of your knife down the sentence removing all of the leaves go all the way around the parsley we're moving as many of the leaves as possible you can save the stems for making a stock roll the parsley leaves up into a ball and chop them finely use quick straight motions with your knife and don't just hack at the parsley by hacking at it you'll bruise it and it'll be wilted and flavorless and your tabouli you want about two handfuls or one heaping cup of chopped parsley then chop up about half a cup of mint leaves picking off the stem roll them up and slice them down once again don't hack it your herbs are the scallions the parsley and the minty or food processor add a tablespoon of freshly ground cumin the juice and zest of one lemon and a drizzle of olive oil about 1 tablespoon and give it a quick pulse just to combine everything when the bulgur has finished soaking to your liking add in your chopped vegetables and your herbs and mix it all together tastes and just the seasoning if necessary and chill the tabbouleh until you're ready to serve it now the key to this tabbouleh recipe is to fold one your parsley has got to be as fresh as possible and two the cumin if your part is all faded or wilted the bully will taste flat and the cumin is a little touched I like to add to give the salad a deeper flavor although to believe traditionally scooped up with romaine lettuce leaves I like to make it a vegetarian main dish at barbecues for serving it on top of a grilled pita bread or flatbread with some feta cheese our flatbread episode with Brendan works great for this just check it out right now by clicking on this link right here throw the flatbread dough or a pre baked pita bread on the grill top with some feta cheese and skip the tabbouleh on top add a little squeeze of lemon and enjoy its tabbouleh pizza this tabbouleh recipe makes about 8 large side disse portions cracked bulgur wheat can be found in bulk bins or in boxes at most health food stores or middle-eastern groceries depending on what vegetables you use and if you use homegrown parsley or mint the total cost should come down to between 6 and 8 dollars for about 75 cents to a dollar a person it'll cost a little bit more with the fayta' cheese and the flatbread obviously but it's a healthy and delicious lunch that you can make quickly and easily and it travels well so now it's your turn what I want to know this week is what's a dish that you've taught yourself to love let me know on Twitter
