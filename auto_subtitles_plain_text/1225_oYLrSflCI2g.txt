 hi this is mara welcome to medulla recipe.com developing on your death today we are going to make grow these chapati or fold I have arrested people complaining that their octaves are very soft and they are fresh and it start to become very hard and chewy as the time code today I am going to show you how to prepare extra soft rotates in higher structures where will be prepared Alaric Rufus today we will see how to prepare this layer of this in two different ways so let's get started we will begin with reading - a potato for this we need whole week's loss try to use good quality hold it slow take this into a Depot like this next we'll add some oil about two teaspoons and add some salt just to test first mix all the ingredients together mix it by hand just like that once we mix all dry ingredients now let's add some bomb water into it make sure you use lukewarm water add water keep on adding small amount of water time this show potato is ready you can see its consistency this is a very soft oh but this is not too thin dough this is not sticking to hand when we press it and this is not too stiff as well we are easily able to press it this is how we want to knead this chapati dough now just cover this otherwise not in the plastics in linkage and give this dough for about 30 minutes I have seen of the people they need that all and immediately they start to over of this but make sure you keep this dough for at least 15 minutes before you start to roll the rotis this is the most most important fact and making roti this capacitor is been resting for 30 minutes now we will start to roll the rupees for this year Collette is heating up on medium to high heat now take this and thanks Josephine spoon off our agenda for multi our hands and again leave this talk just for about a minute just to make it soft once your nail so one more time now take a small ball from this taupe like a golf ball size like that first we will make single loyalty for this give this ball into a cloth coat this belt with wrapper I'm using a whole wheat flour and start rolling this dough will not need to roll this into oval shape like that throw this into a bunch of shape like this now apply some oil over it just three to four drops like this and sprinkle some dry flour wait just like that now press this in between just like that and now close this 2-part to say that again beep this inter j√§vla and start rolling the roti like regular chapati so this like that this roti is ready now to go on the skillet rice the pressure of the scale is also most important thing by roasting rupees if the temperature is too high the locals will get spun and if it is to York then the rotis will become very hot and it will take time to get through I always prefer to roasting on a medium to high heat this skillet is hot enough now I am adding this coating as soon as you see a small bubbles appearing on the open surface of roti just lifting just like that you can see nice golden spots on the other side of coffee apply some oil you may also make use of key script I can apply some oil from this side aspect and see it looks very sloppy toasted from other side this single layer roti is ready country very soft and fluffy it will restore hot rupees in the pot there are chances that moisture gate attack is the spot immediately due to heat from the roti and this rope is become just over that make sure you place some paper towel or paper napkin like this below this you may also make use of Cisco now we are going to make 2 layers roofing for this again take small ball milling piece and roll this like fully just fit this into draft flow and go it like to it Oh once you roll this like booty apply some oil over it just a native expertise apply some draft law like that and make one fork like this I can apply some oil spread it I can apply some crap over it and just close it now dip this into gas law and start rolling like regular roti this is not into triangular shape we are going to make it into a circular shape around I have rolled these rotis make sure you roll this roti evenly from all the sides it should not be stick around its edges and you don't use lots of grass floor while rolling roti if you use lots of gravel road emit an heart now we need to roast it actual tea now in the same way roast this rotate as well you can see bubble started to occur to flip this bow can see a nice golden dot just started to flutter also perfect I bless them all Archy it's perfect just like that process nicely from both the side perfect this two-layer roti is ready make sure its edges are also get roasted it should not be wrong so this to last roti is ready you can see it looks so nice and fluffy now it's very soft this rope is already now the only difference between this to roti is a single leg repiy it quite easy to help slipper as compared to two layers roti they're both taste equally good now let's see how they look here is my two layers roti you can say this is very very soft and once we break this we can see literally see less out there can see this wrote is very very soft and this is double single arrow tea soy and when we break this roti we can see two less or tear just like that literally we can break this rotates into to pass a let produce take very soft wear longer time it takes off for three to four days if you are eating fresh you can eat just like that if you are having this on the second day just microwave for 15 seconds and the soft like cotton thanks watching my video see you
