 hi ladies and gentlemen Andrew roan Beck I'm the executive chef at the poker table Resort and Club and today we're going to make some fresh clam chowder from scratch clam chowder from scratch of course the most important thing are the clams and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring you through all the ingredients that's that's going to be necessary to make this clam chowder of course some beautiful fresh clams and then we have some Yukon Gold potatoes that we're going to add to our soup and then of course I'm gonna use a little bit of smoked bacon some onions some celery a touch of garlic of course fresh thyme a little bit of bay leaf and then we're gonna finish the soup with a little bit of fresh cream so let's get started just for the sake of time here I've already started I have some fresh clam juice right here it's already hot I'm ready to go so I would take my fresh clams at this point which I washed very very well to make sure there's no sand on them I'm going to add those into my into my clam juice and basically what I'm going to end up with are my nice beautiful steamed clams already open again just for the sake of time we're gonna move along once my clams are opened I'm going to remove them and then I'm going to shuck them and this is what I'm going to end up with some beautiful meaty fresh clams that were going to rough chop and finish off in the soup so while once I remove those clams from here I'm going to add in my potatoes next I want to blanch my potatoes I want my potatoes to a little past halfway so I'm going to blanch those so they the starch gets in that into that broth and I get a little bit of clam flavor into my potatoes as well so while those are blanching I'm gonna move over to my other pot here and I'm gonna start my other ingredients okay I'm going to start with just a touch of olive oil just a touch just to get things going I'm gonna add in my bacon okay I'm going to render down my bacon actually I'm gonna do more than render I'm going to make sure that my bacon is fully cooked fully cooked nice and brown because once that bacon sits in the soup it'll start to get a little soft so I want to make sure that my Bacon's cooked again for the sake of time we're gonna say our makin is is crispy I'm gonna now add in my onions I'm going to add in the fresh celery I'll put it all in okay we're gonna get this going here just a touch I'm going to add in just maybe like one clove or fresh garlic just to wake this up and really get going that's working very nicely I'm going to add in my bay leaf at this point toss that in here too is essential ingredients for clam chowder bay leaf and a little bit of fresh thyme so I'm gonna add my fresh thyme in here okay and I'm gonna let this just work all together once my bacon is crispy and I added in my onions my celery I want to lower down my heat okay because now I'm going to add a little bit of flour that's called roux that's what's going to thicken our clam chowder so I'm gonna dust a little bit here with my flour with my whisk I'm gonna start to make my roux DANC once we let that go Roux two different things with roux I'm making a blonde roux I don't want it that's why we lowered down my heat I don't want the heat to be too hot because once I start to if I start to burn the roux or start to add color to the row it's going to change the color of my soup so I want to make a blonde roux so I lower my temperature down I'm gonna be a little patient with that and I'm gonna let that cook out once you have that once you have that toasted peanut flavor then I'm good now I'm ready to go with everything else I'm gonna take my potatoes that were blanched in my clam juice my hot clam juice I'm going to add that in I'm gonna turn the heat back up bring this up to a good simmer now I'm gonna start the season a little bit of white pepper a little bit of fresh sea salt I'm gonna start letting all these come together now you're gonna let this cook out for about 10 or 15 or 15 minutes okay ten or 15 minutes and now your rule will start to thicken okay I'm going to take my clams I don't want to overcook my clams I'm gonna rough chop my fresh clams I like to leave them a little on the large side okay I'm gonna take those I'm gonna drop those into my my soup I'm gonna let those develop a little bit okay now I'm going to have a nice medium consistency here we're gonna let this cook out for about 15 minutes gonna let all these flavors at this point I didn't put the cream in if I wanted to do that I would turn my soup off after 15-20 minutes of letting it cook I would allow it to cool down then I would put it into the refrigerator and then the next day if I want that soup now I would finish it with the cream like I said just before I finish I'm going to finish my clam chowder with just a little bit of cream I also like my clam chowder to be a little on the light side not so thick like Elmer's glue and of course I'm going to finish that with just a touch of fresh parsley right on top to give it that nice beautiful fresh clean color that's how it's done beautiful fresh clam chowder made from scratch enjoy
