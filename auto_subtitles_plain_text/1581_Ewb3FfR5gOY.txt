 his philosophy regarding beer is simple number one love beer number two share the love Joe sutler is known as the beer chef he's teamed up with the new third-base brewery to celebrate st. Patrick's Day with traditional fare joining me live now is the beer chef himself chose don't lurk Good Morning Joe good morning or as they say in Ireland a hundred thousand welcomes a hundred thousand welcomes to you too now you say you like to combine your two passions food and beer now how do you do that um love beer love food eat try them experience them play with the pallets try different things do all your recipes have beer in them most of them do or I find a way to either incorporate the beer into it or with it beer pairs with so many things it's even more versatile than than wine it's it's beer as the new wine is a lot of folks are starting to say I got that one from an Kapler at the Gazette actually but I've heard it other places as well now you're the founder of beer university that's my kind of school tell me about that well beer use it's an offshoot of classes that I started teaching with kirkwood beer appreciation classes we saw that they did wine classes and we thought why not beer with the growth of the micro breweries and you know the imports have been around for a while the world of beer is just exploding national beer wholesalers Association did the cooking with beer challenge last year chefs are starting to incorporate more beer saw Rachel Ray had beer and one of her recipes not too long ago it's it's one of those growing things so I just thought why not combine these two and expand on more than just your appreciation tell us about what we're going to make today we're making an Irish a traditional Irish dish today called boxty boxty is essentially potato pancakes and they can be made sweet or savory so you can top them with you know in maple syrup brown sugar sugar butter you know apple pie filling jam things like that you can also fill them or cover them with stews have them with sausages it's a traditional dish over there that they eat both sweet and savory and it's it's in practically all the pubs in Dublin and other places I've been in Ireland it delicious easy to make very simple and inexpensive too and what are some of the ingredients in box tea it's pretty simple you've got some mashed potato you use leftover mashed potatoes some shredded potato or grated potato a little bit of flour a little bit of butter a little salt little baking powder and in this case here and you have a potato in your hand you're ready to make it and we'll be back live with Joe later on in the show on how to make boxee showing up on good day Iowa boxty on the griddle boxee on the pan if you can't make boxy you'll never get a man that's the official poem for this dish joining me live now the teaches how to get a man I mean make foxy is the beer chef himself shows sutler good morning joe good morning boxy is a traditional irish potato pancake first off go through how to make it it's pretty simple you start with mashed potatoes use about cup of mashed potatoes I use leftover mashed potatoes works fine but you can mash them yourself add to that about a cup of grated potato or shredded potato incorporate those together mix well we do that in a second set it aside then you add your dry ingredients which is about a cup to a cup and a half of flour about a teaspoon of baking powder and about a teaspoon of salt mix those together whisk well then you're going to incorporate the two together you bring them together and you know we have to add some beer to this trev I need a beer Thank You the Tilted Kilt this is the third base breweries tilted kilt this is their Irish beer for the season a nice Irish amber kind of beer you mix that in you incorporate it stir it all together and you'll end up with a kind of a thick pancake like batter it's pretty simple take your thick pancake like batter we've got some here already we've been snacking on this a little bit already put it on the grill just like you would a regular pancake after a few minutes flip it so you get them nice and golden brown but once both sides you get all golden brown throw it on a plate and here we put some strawberry jam and some chocolate stout sauce on here and this is made with a dark chocolate melted in a double boiler about a quarter cup of corn syrup and quarter to a half cup of a nice stout and you'll get a really rich chocolatey flavor this is where this is what we're eating for breakfast here this morning your camera guy has been snarfing on the left and right real simple to do if you wanted to make a savory dish you could do the same thing lay out your pancakes put on some stew put on some sausage gravy whatever you whatever you like you guys better bring some back here so where do we go to get the recipe you can go to ww beer you calm okay and I heard you earned a trip to New York City to compete in the 2006 cooking with fear finals what was that like oh that was such a great experience we went out to New York tail end of november spent about five days out there we got to go to bobby flay's restaurant have dinner drank a lot of different beers met a lot of different people from all over the country and had a great time with the competition and will you be cooking up more of this dish at the third base fury this weekend well actually this weekend what we're doing is a traditional Irish stew made with of course the stout beer here and probably some of the Tilted Kilt some lamb and vegetables and all that we're going to be having a brown bread and Irish brown bread and Irish shortbread with some fun toppings and such on it and when did you start cooking with fear oh I've been doing it since you know pretty much as long as I've been cooking I I love to cook and I've always been a fan of a beer that the flavors of beer when I moved back from Germany in the mid 80s I couldn't find a beer that I really thought was a decent beer after living in the land of beer kind of thing so I really started developing my palate over there and then in traveling all over the world have experienced some really great beers some really great foods and it just made sense to start combining them after seeing other people doing this and a lot of the pubs and like that beer has been around for roughly 10,000 years and it's been an integral part of cooking for almost as long especially in the Middle Ages and even in colonial America beer was something healthy and healthful to drink it was much safer than the water and you get a lot of flavors and character that you know water something like that wouldn't necessarily bring and how many different flavors of beer do you think you've had oh I I would lose track I know I've been to about 300 different breweries micro breweries and brewpubs around the world multiply that times probably six to seven beers at each place and that's not counting the commercial beers and so on so I home brewers and everything else I've lost track and st. Patrick's Day it's a great day to try any recipe the boxee looks delicious thanks Joe you're very welcome
