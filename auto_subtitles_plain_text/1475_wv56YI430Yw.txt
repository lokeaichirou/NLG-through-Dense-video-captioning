 hi I'm Phil Anderson executive chef for Harris Teeter I'm going to show you the secret for great grilled brats the first thing you need to do is you need to get yourself brats a whole onion 32 ounces of beer room temperature put it on the grill and gradually heat it up now you don't want it to boil you just want to get it up to a point where you've got those brats already cooked because you don't want to develop steam within the casing because the steam bursts out and it cracks the casing so once you get it to this point the the brats are pretty pretty well cooked you can tell they're pretty firm you don't care about this you don't care about what's in here you're not going to use it any anymore but what you are going to use is you're going to use this here the landing liquid that's the twenty eight ounces of stewed tomatoes a roughly chopped bell pepper and one tablespoon of brown sugar 32 ounces of beer now that's what the brats are going to stay in once we get them grilled so we're going to take our brats put them on the grill this is direct heat we want to make sure that the proteins are sticking to the bars and we want to make sure that it's not hard for us to to move them so that they relax and we know that we're going to have a really nice bar burn in our brats I want to get a couple of marks on them so I'm going to kind of move them around put them in the grills in between the bars you see they didn't explode and a lot of people don't understand what what the dynamic is is going on when you bring it to a bare simmer you cook the meat and it has a steamed it hasn't wanted to explode so now you're just moving it around to get your your burns in there okay well if we get a little bit more char on the bottom of those we're put them back in our beer there you are the secret to grilling brats enjoy to watch the other segments in this video series or for how-to videos on almost any other topic visit monkey-see calm
