 hi everybody welcome back to the real life kitchen my name is Mike Ben injure owner operator of Chef Mike dossier today we're making one of my favorites Caesar salad I'm just going to start off here like with all good things start off with garlic this is a micro planer you haven't got one of these Plains garlic and chocolate for than anything in the world start off one clove if you like more add more like less add less anchovy paste now anchovy face is 2 layer of salt it's a layer of flavor not everybody likes it but you know what it adds something to it with you don't have it you'll notice it's missing that's not good lemon juice you can use lime juice even use vinegar I prefer lemon juice watch the seeds though the seeds aren't very nice egg yolks egg yolks are better than egg whites or whole egg dressings I prefer yolks they're richer they're also safer so I have two in there you only want to have one that's up to you like a little more richness we're going to have to mustard you serve you like this happens to be a grainy Dijon if you want to use a super hot one that's up to you if you want to use a mild one that's up to you as well again it's all of a preference issue I put a teaspoon there now you mix it up now you'll notice here I have nothing in here that is a preservative I have nothing in here that's not the highest of quality ingredients when you get stuff in bottles that isn't always the case Parmesan cheese there's only one cheese for this parmigiano-reggiano you can tell Reggiano because it has the red general label on the grind right in the side there it's very expensive it's about $45 a kilo but that's what it costs and you only use a little that's probably a key of maybe a teaspoon a tablespoon and a half maybe I don't know 85 cents worth for the entire brick that's there it's worth using the very very best of ingredients so let's recap we have cheese we have eggs we've garlic now we're going to add some pepper fresh cracked is always the best we're gonna add some sea salt we had them we've added mustard now we add some olive oil and again spend the money and buy the good stuff extra virgin is worth it and you just slowly drizzle it in because what you're doing the fat that's in the egg yolks is mixing up with the oil and you're creating what's called an emulsion she's gonna blend this through you're gonna just go very very gently don't want to rush this whole thing though from start to finish takes about oh four or five minutes that's a boat on now there's my dress give it a taste test salty sweet fragrant I think into the little more lemon pepper that's just me I think it needs a little more garlic but again nice just me I like lots of garlic in mine put that in there at the micro planer Micra planers are about 30 bucks available at Zaire's 14 oz rookie and super stores even dollars I think azzam they're fantastic tools chocolate cheese garlic nutmeg fantastic so there's our dressing it's creamy and rich I'm going to take half of it out because one of the problems you have when you go to restaurants as they put in too much dressing so I'm going to add some lettuce so you can add your romaine now I want obsess about you know having every single piece exactly the same size it's important though that it's washed and properly dried wedding water in there it's gonna water down your dressing and water doesn't taste as good as dressing this you know so cover this all up when you go to restaurants what they do is they add too much dressing I want to have the flavor of the garlic I want to taste the flavor of the lettuce that's why I'm mixing it up like this I can add more later you can always add more dressing you can always add more lettuce it's hard to take it out it doesn't work the same way that's why I'm always very cautious about adding too much dressing in a hurry so here's your salad this will keep for Oh the dressing is good for a day or two that's about although there's no preservatives in it and raw egg yolks you know you always want to be cautious of those even though the eggs in Canada are the very very highest of quality I'm always very cautious so I would take this take our lovely dress park that ode from scratch seven great ingredients available very easily ingredients everywhere for every forty knows every Loblaws every Sylvie's every store in the area we'll always have all the things you need to make this Caesar salad I think the flavors are incredible I always finish this off with some fresh parmigiano-reggiano in fact I always lots of parmigiano-reggiano just like that let go that comes off like microplane racks just best ever a couple twists of fresh cracked pepper and there you go ladies and gentlemen start to finish five six seven minutes available everywhere inexpensive quality ingredients quality flavors my name is Mike Vantage ER owner of chef Mike that CA and a freaking friend of the real life kitchens thank you very much
