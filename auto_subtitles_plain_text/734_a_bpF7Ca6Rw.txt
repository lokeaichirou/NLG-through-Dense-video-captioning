 well when you're flying a fish for sushi especially tuna you don't want to get it too wet so when you do fillet it and make sure you think when you cut it out and you lay all the the fillets down skin side down so they don't get wet and when we start off right behind the head I'm going to take our knife we're gonna slide up right behind the head come down into the belly cavity slice right through the belly cavity I like to spin the tuna around come through here right there top it ahead and almost trace your steps once you get it all traced out then you can take your knife straight down to the backbone and then what I do is I turn the knife around push the knife through to the other side and we run it straight across now you can go ahead and grab your fillet and lay it skin side down skinning tuna is a very different very different than skinning most fish and basically what we do is we call when we do a tuna we call Lauren at amount first we're gonna cut the belly belly bones out once we get that done we're gonna go ahead and cut down the center line taker you got to have a flexible knife it's got to be able to bend like this if you don't have one that won't Bend like that it make it very difficult to fillet these tuna can you just keep working it slowly and voila our last step on filleting a tuna is removing the dark meat and the dark meat is kind of spliced through the middle of the fillet so you kind of have to gotta go and take a little bit off at a time as it comes in it's almost like a triangle you really should use a curved edge knife to do this with it makes it a little easier then in the same sense you want to make sure you get all this dark meat out when cutting sushi there's a little part here that you don't use that's got a little fine line right here what we're gonna do is we're going to remove that you want to cut these really thin for sashimi and they're absolutely delicious and when it's this fresh you don't even need any wasabi that is awesome before the jump Oh
