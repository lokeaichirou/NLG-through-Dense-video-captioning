 hi I'm chef Tom welcome to fortune cooking today I'm going to show you a really popular dish in the Asian family it's called Mapo tofu you can make vegetarian or you can have shrimp or pork or any other Mapo tofu is find the main ingredient is this black bean paste all right they have a garlic ginger and black bean and hot pepper and another ingredient that I like to introduce is samba a lot of people know is the vegetarian hot chili with a bunch of vegetable and pepper and you know lime everything go together that's a really good one I feel like very spicy today so we have cilantro cooking wine soy sauce and we're gonna garnish some ginger couple of slice we want to have a fine chop okay and then come across or you can now grated ginger wine the ginger or you can buy the ginger in the in the jar all right okay ginger is done put on the side and now the garlic smash it really good and cut it really fine those are the facing ingredient and this is a very popular dish so really good with the rice and some people like to put it in the different version they can do some add some vegetable peppers those are good and mushroom and I have half of the sweet onions and you cut a really fine too [Applause] okay just like this and the next thing is I have this uh green onion for the garnishing I like to cut it you should have like to cut with the diagonally like this just angle this way and just give them a really fine chop and I usually save the white part of the green onion which is the scallion this is for the garnishing so I put on the side all right and what happened is that I can use that to saute with my onion with the garlic with the ginger will give them a really nice flavor okay all right now we have to take here our tofu this is part of the main ingredient too as well so this tofu is kind of like a medium-firm all right you can get soft or really firm and we love tofu I mean if you just taste a plain tofu is no flavor to it but if you know how to cook it and take care of it it will give you a really great flavor all right so what I'm gonna do is are usually cut in between split it into half all right just like this and then I in the middle and then two more cut here so we have full section now and here I go to the middle too and the same thing all right that's tofu we're ready to cook here wat on medium one tablespoon of the high smoke point cooking oil and then I will put the onion ginger garlic in the green onion first saute until fragrant take about a minute so after about a minute what they look like smells so good hmm here's a black bean paste and there's the sambar hot sauce very easy to make go really get with the rice so delicious hmm no so good this is the one - spicy just reduce the hot sauce now you can have a little spicy to it and that is a great dish with the shrimp Oh pork here we go so people another minute so after a minute pour some wine that's that alcohol would reduce a little bit soy sauce and let them cook for another minute you give me about a minute you got all the hot sauce and the black bean and all the onion and everything garlic ginger let them cook little bit get the flavor out and you can it's a vegetable stock oh I just used twin water okay and now stir a little bit and put your lips on it it's nice to have a wok with the lids because it's hard to cook at home because the temperature usually is not as hot as powerful at a restaurant unless you have a commercial or stove at home which is really nice but I always get a wok with a lid that will help to raise up your temperature in the wok okay okay after you bring up to the boil and the sauce is nice and happy or cook together and you just put the tofu in gently just like this okay you don't want to disturb the tofu too much all right just like this and tofu will absorb the sauce and you need to let them cook a little bit so I'm gonna turn a little high higher and then I put my lid back on and let them must slowly cook once you bring up to the boil again and just let them cook medium high and just let the sauce cook for like I will say five to ten minutes and just let all the ingredients all the spices get in through the tofu and you don't need to stir the tofu just keep control on the temperature and of course make sure they're not over burn but just cool like this okay and let them cook until you can see the sauce start taking a little bit okay it's about four minutes okay Jenny you feel like this you see the sauce they kind of like flip over cover up the tofu because you're not gonna you know stir fry the tofu right now you're just gonna let them slow cook and now is the time to get to try your sauce foods nice flavor spicy powerful boy spicy good some people want to add some sweetness to it a little bit sugar or just the way it is I'm gonna leave it just like this if you want you can have a touch of the half teaspoon of the brown sugar now they'll be good so right now at this point is that the sauce is dry out pretty good so some people would not touch anything just like this I'm finish up and take a serve but I'd like to add a visit out I have a potato starch not much maybe any one teaspoon potato starch because I added the thicker that's how you do it you don't flip the tofu too much um you just count like it swore like this okay I have like maybe just a little bit tiny potato starch not even like 1/3 teaspoon with some cold water okay and the end very important in assessing the oil like this okay it's done Mapo tofu is done smells so good happy here's your vegetarian Mapo tofu try it believe me it's really delicious good flavor and as I said you can add shrimp or pork or chicken make a great dish and go really good with the rice and I got it with some green onion and cilantro all right wonderful dish I'm chef Tom thank you for watching fortune cookie I see you next time
