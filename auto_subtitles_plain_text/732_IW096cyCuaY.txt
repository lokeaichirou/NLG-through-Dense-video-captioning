 hi guys today I'm going to show you how to make calamari this is my favorite favorite thing in this world so different people use their own mix of spices I'm just going to show you my version of it hope you like it so let's get started 450 grams of squeak cut into rings half a cup of flour one and a half teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of black pepper powder 1 teaspoon of mixer quarter of a teaspoon of garlic powder sump oil for frying put all your salt and spices in the flour mixture stir it well to mix everything up sprinkle some salt and some pepper on your sweet flavor all the layers now this is done what you're going to do next is we will put that in a ziplock bag all the flowers so that it's easier to handle otherwise it gets so messy so get a ziplock bag put all your flour mixture inside and then we will marinate those places seal it tightly and then just take it easy isn't it so much less messy I'm doing it tough first and then we will transfer into another train when all the sweet pieces are well coated transfer them to a separate bowl and shake off the excess flour it might get a little messy do the same with the rest of the marination heat oil in a pan put the squeeze in hot oil do not overcrowd it we will fry them roughly two minutes two minutes each side it's very easy to make calamari at home and you get more portion for the price using the restaurants they give you small portion you have to share it and if you make them at home it's very simple send them around and of the site some people fry them for just a couple of minutes I like it two minutes on each side but you do it once and then you know how you would like them but you don't have to keep them on the oil for long because they get not a hard Prince I've done now I get up for along with three minutes and it looks like they're crispy shake the excess oil and then add them to a tissue line and repeat the same with the rest of the squeeze put them in a serving dish serve them your favorite sauce and some lemon wedges I hope you enjoy guys made them it's very simple to do that's your calamari you
