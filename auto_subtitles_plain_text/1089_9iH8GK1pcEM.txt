 today we're going to be making pepperoni and bacon pizza this is a real meat lovers Pizza and I'm gonna be doing this on a stone so it's stone baked just like you get at your local pizzeria the first thing that we want to do is grab ourselves some pepperoni and let's slice that up here's a little closer view you can slice the pizza thinly or thick whatever way you like and then the next thing that we need is bacon and what I'm doing here is I'm just slicing the bacon up really small so that it's gonna so that it's gonna fry up much easier in my frying pan so let's get all that cut up and we'll get that into the frying pan all righty the next step is to fry off our bacon in the frying pan and the reason why I'm doing this is that I just want to make sure that the bacon is thoroughly cooked so let's fry that up and then we're gonna let it cool earlier in the day I made a recipe of pizza dough this is for a thinner crust pizza and out of that one recipe of dough I created two dough balls so the first thing we need to do is roll out our dough with the rolling pin you can see that's a really nice dough you can see the air bubbles the little air pockets in the Dell now I'm gonna flour my pizza peel and I'm gonna pop that on there and what the flour is gonna do is gonna it's going to let the the whole pizza slide right off the pizza peel or the pizza paddle and it'll slide right onto my baking stone with ease you can either do this with flour or you can use cornmeal which a lot of people like but it makes a little bit more of a mess in your oven so we got down the sauce our cheese and now we're putting on the pepperoni and then I'm gonna get some bacon on there alright let's just get the rest of that bacon on and then the pizzas going right on to the stone the oven is set at 500 degrees and I'm gonna let that pizza go for exactly seven minutes and here we go only seven minutes later and the pizza's ready you can actually see the air pockets in the pizza showing you how hot that pizza stone is and here's the finished product and I'll tell you this is one delicious pizza so let's cut it up and give it a little taste test alright and this is pizza number two and the same thing again pop it on to the pizza stone that pizza stone is very very hot so as soon as the pizza hits that stone it starts baking right away and seven minutes later here we have our second pizza already done and there we go as I'm zooming in here you can see the air bubble way in the back it's starting to deflate that just shows you how hot the air is inside that pizza and here we have the beautiful finished product this is a great pizza bacon and pepperoni yum yum yum anyway so that's it for this video so I'll see you next time you
