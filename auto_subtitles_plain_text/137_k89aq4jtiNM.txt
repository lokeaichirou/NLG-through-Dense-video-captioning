 you I started my journey on the southeastern coast of Thailand just near the Cambodian border a place steeped with culture history architecture and of course really great food I think I found myself in one of the most quaint streets in Thailand a historic Street in junta bori along the river it's absolutely incredible and I've parked myself right here alongside this lady who's selling these Kannamma it's like a sticky rice and young coconut wrapped in the leaf that they Thatcher ooze with and then grilled over charcoal but I'll have that later what I'm going to cook now is PUD tag bung gut K which is a pad thai using chicken and prawn and the noodles are actually made right here in this area so let's get started so first we'll just light our gas okay pad thai is very simple but you have to watch it and you have to stir regularly okay we're going to start with just a few tablespoons of oil and the first thing to cook is some garlic but not on to high heat and just let the aromatic characteristics of the garlic come out and once you can smell the garlic we add the chicken and the prawn busy little street so I do harp and then next we add some tofu the tofu adds a lovely chew to the dish and always Pad Thai tofu next we're going to add the noodles and the noodles have been soaked in water really important when you're making pad thai to soak the noodles in water overnight and that way you don't have to add any more liquid to the dish so that we add one egg just cracked in just move the egg around let it cook before you stir it through the rest of the noodles okay some tamarind tamarind makes it nice and sour and then a touch of brown sugar just about one teaspoon is perfect and then we add some fish sauce some oyster sauce just a tablespoon and then we finish the dish using some garlic chives just torn up turn off the heat some bean shoots mix through and then the final ingredient just some pickled daikon just have a quick taste splashmore fish sauce and it's ready to go okay now whenever you're serving any type of noodle dish I always suggest using tongs and then lift the noodles out of the wok and then when you put them down give them a bit of a twist just to give us an extra height and then let all the goodies land on top okay to finish that off a couple of wedges of lime some more fresh bean shoots on top and some of the whole garlic chives that you just pick up and chew really simple and then some peanuts over the top and there you have it Pub tae Gong cup guy right here in the most amazing Street in Chanthaburi
