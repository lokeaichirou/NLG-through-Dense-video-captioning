 hi this is tony from cookingaround welcome again to my kitchen and today i'm going to make something very hard and very special a cottage pie now I don't do it typically the same way as a lot of people do I don't use the cheese because I want the flavor for the need to come up so I have all these goodies here and let's get started this is going to be right here so we have our pan hurry hot we add two tablespoons of oil and I take two medium onions diced stir the dough around now half-point on heating pipe just let that cook for about and to medium carrots diced and about a stock and a half of celery slice and now about 1/4 cup of butter now you can use more butter for this recipes you want and about a teaspoon of salt just about to come along the point we just want the butter to melt and into the vegetables but I do not want to over cook do it now you can see the vegetables right now have softened and what I basically do is turn off the heat and remove this in the pan you get up again I took the vegetables put on the side and I'm about to do something really really naughty now you don't have to do this but it gives that little extra oomph and taste in the meat I'm using a tablespoon a pig fat yes pure pig fat I know a lot of these are they're saying oh so good but it's going high cholesterol you know something you're right but if you don't want to use that just put two tablespoons upwards so now I'm gonna let this heat up okay now I have here about eight hundred grams of ground beef and I have them ground especially for me I chose the beef with a medium fat content in it give it some flavor you can use lean but you're not going to get that nice texture taste as if you would use a medium so it's up to you and oh my themselves now you can see that the meat is all ground but still if you look here too much liquid and I'm going to remove this liquid right now by putting the lid on top and removing this okay I removed part of the liquid here this plus some there so I'm just going to cook for another three to five minutes just to take the rest of the liquid humor bond now you can leave it if you want I like to do it this way and now we have 300 milligrams of beef stock now this is only half the other half is on the side and try to get the best quality beef stock account or just dissolve a couple of cubes into one water and now I put that on give it a nice stir is liquid on the bottom again but it's the liquid that I want at this point and now I go back to our vegetables on the website and we put them all by sight and now stir that around now how is that cottage pie starter boxing bell around and now I'm going to add about a tablespoon of leading berries or you can add which is your sauce whichever one you want and I put well about tablespoon and all what all right stir that around why is that ever looking good and now the famous famous effort I would say about a teaspoon of pepper and about a teaspoon of thyme now you can add more or you can add less and now you grab the rest of half of the each stock and you add about one tablespoon of white flour or corn flour and I want you to whisk that really really well and then I want you to take that and put that into your mixture just like that how is that stackable now it's important for the base nest for salt so Beverly here and remember again what I said this is for you not for me and we just you know I think it's just perfect I will not have any more salt or anything else now you can add other herbs and spices you want to here I can add a little bit of hot sauce if you want but I'm just going to make it natural like this and then the hot sauce later autumn I did play the kiss just in case my guests don't like it that huh so then what I do is I add some parsley now you don't have to put parsley do this recipe because it really doesn't call for parsing but you know something I like the atom countries and vitamins that come to the purse like unless he gives it a nice look so I just put that it but like I said you don't have your so this about half a cup fresh firstly I use around or that's my favorite and now we just turn off the heat and we put this beside and going to be stitch okay we're back I have here about a kilo of potatoes I chose the starch type of potatoes because we're going to make mashed potatoes so they were boiled time until they're softened and now we take our handy dandy little masher and we just make one complete circle around each over Oh smush and now I had about a quarter cup of butter about a teaspoon of salt and again the famous about three-quarters of a teaspoon whatever and now we just move that one more time around just to get everything mixed now if you want the potatoes a little bit more soft just add a little bit of milk and depends on your potato depends on how thick you want for this recipe I don't want to add any milk I want the potato stick now I'll take your handy handy spoon and give it a good good stir that it's not ready we are I got my baking dish I'm using glass for me it's easier to wash you can use the metal or you can use a lasagna dish to anyone so here it is and now we take our mixture here that we get up the meat and that all inside mmm just I love the smell the balloon Perry's mixing with the heat go and bring that around and try to make that as even as possible this is the way I like to do things and try not to be too perfect in the kitchen because the kitchen is another place for perfectionists yeah and now we take our mashed potatoes and we put that inside now this recipe is very very special for me it is my recipe and I know it's my recipe because I basically stole it from my friend Eamon well mom when she is a chef a great chef in Cyprus which I will add a link to his restaurant at the end of this video and he's the one that came up with this recipe and like I said he was generous enough to leave the door open and I went from the door and I took his recipe he might be a little upset with me because after all I did put bacon fat in it the recipe does not call for that but I like to be a bit of a troublemaker now at this point you can add cheese to the top if you want I'm not going to any cheese I like it just the way it is now at this point I'd like to take my fork and just basically I like to run it like this on top and the reason is for some reason it makes it more crispy and then the size are just tucking the sides like this and there we have it now my oven is preheated to 325 degrees it is a gas stove and what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave it in there for 40 minutes and we will be back this right out of the oven so what we're going to do now is we're just going to let it cool down for I say about 30 minutes before we cut it now if you want to talk to me a little bit more Brown just open the top grill and we just go from above but I like it like this just when the tips start to turn brown because I like too much Christmas but then again that's what I like whatever you like and now just dump it off it takes a nice parsley and just sprinkle the top like that now how does that look on your station absolutely awesome so enjoy and thank you for being with me and I hope to see you again on my next risk thank you
