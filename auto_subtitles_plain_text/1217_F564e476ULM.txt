 hey everybody welcome back to my channel today I have an incredible treat for you guys I used to work at a steak house that did these little lobster corndogs and this morning for some reason me and Rachel woke up with this hankering for corndogs so we went down the mall picked up a corndog on the stick and I just sort of popped into my head that I used to bake these lobster corn dogs almost every single day for like a year straight so I figured why not share this recipe with you guys it's going to absolutely blow your mind you know corndogs are incredible already but fill the lobster and you have a totally you know you totally elevate the idea of a corndog to the next level so with that said let's go in the kitchen and show you guys how to make these lobster corn dogs so in this recipe I'm using fresh lobster tails straight from the store and it's really important that use freshly cleaned lobsters because frozen lobster tails tend to stick to the shells after they're cooked and that will prevent a clean removal of the meat so once you've tied the tails together with a little bit of butchers twine or just plain old string get some water on a rolling boil and you're going to cook the tails for about ten minutes in the class for around seven so after you're finished boiling the lobster you're going to quickly grab a bowl of ice water and then place all the lobster meat in this ice water which is going to shock the meat and cool it down so it doesn't overcook so once the lobster is completely cooled down remove it from the bath and then you're gonna start to take the shells off with just a little bit of pressure a cloth and some careful handling you so when you come to the club the lobster the first thing we want to do is remove the knuckle after that take the bottom pincer off and then wrap the claw in a towel and give it a few smacks at the back of your knife and the meat comes sliding out fairly easy so in order to get to the knuckle meet you're going to need a decent pair of shears make two incisions opposite of each other on the shell remove one side of the shell on the lobster Mitch comes sliding right out once all your lobster meat is completely cleaned and all the shells are removed from it all if you do now start skewering everything up you so what's your lobster skewered up and ready to go all I have to do now is make your batter for frying and in this is basically just a corn muffin mix that I bought from the store some milk and an egg and all I have to do is completely incorporate the mixture you one thing I would recommend before embarking on this recipe is try to find some sort of stick holder that would hold the skewer in place as a fries I'm not too sensitive to oil popping on my hands but for those of you who have sensitive skin or aren't used to it I would I would definitely look out for something like that so once you're done frying lobster corn dogs just gently place them on a towel to blot off any excess oil and I'm going to plate these with a little bit of whole-grain honey mustard and there you have it some beautiful lobster corn dogs all right so these beautiful corn dogs are finished that was a pretty intense process but definitely worth the while got a little bit of this spicy honey mustard because what's a corn dog without mustard mmm she's a nice little red tinge of the lobster really really crispy has that sweet flavor from the corn mmm nice and buttery this honey mustard is killer kinds like it's like a little spicy because it's whole-grain but the honey is that sweetness kind of cool to job just a little bit well hopefully you guys enjoyed this recipe definitely nice and tender lobster beautiful crispy corn dog so hopefully guys enjoyed if you did please thumbs up and subscribe and comment below for future video requests and things like that and I'll see you guys next time with some more recipes bye everybody you
