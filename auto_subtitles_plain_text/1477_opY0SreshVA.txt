called me hunt and in Vietnamese I can't wait to share with you the recipe but before that let me bring you to visit an egg to the home factory to see how the noodles that we are using today as well as the won ton wrappers are actually made the egg noodle making process is quite interesting there's actually just four ingredients which are flour eggs water and salts they are mixed together in a large bowl until the dough is formed when they make it in larger volume of course they will need a machine to do the mixing and kneading job after that they let the doll run through another machine about four to five times to flatten the dough into thin sheets more flour is added to cover the surface of each sheet to make sure that is not sticky when the flour sheet is flat enough they will let it run through a cutting machine to cut it into the noodles then the noodles are rolled into serving sides bundles to make the wonton wrapper they roll the dough until I really paper-thin and and cut into square pieces that's really interesting right now let buy some egg noodles and wonton wrapper home to cook a delicious bowl of wonton noodle soup today let's begin recipe to make the fillings for
