 today we're gonna learn how to make tuna fish rolls these are really popular roll in Japan third everywhere my wife the Japan housewife absolutely loves them and she said we gotta show everyone how to make them and I gotta be honest I like him way more than I cared with man so we just have some lettuce and some cucumber right there on the regular rice base that we have here if you don't have to do that please click on the link and see our other video we show you how to make rice no problem and here we just have some tuna fish that's mixed up with some mayonnaise you can do that to your own taste salt and pepper I'm sure most of you know how to make tuna fish at home and really these are super simple you just put the ingredients together like so and then roll the rice and the roll like so and really there's not much to these but these taste great they're fantastic every time we would go out for sushi in Japan we'd always be sure to order them these things are I kind of compare and like the french fries of japan because they're there everywhere and I'm kind of surprised or not popular here in the US either but once you get it rolled over you get your super sharp sushi knife and you just go ahead and cut it you'll notice that our knife is pretty long so it knocks the sushi get it quite a bit but we're just cutting these rolls like so wiping the knife every time and that rag has a rice vinegar water mixture that keeps the rice from sticking to the knife and helps the knife cut through it and just like butter so yeah it's I've probably more of these rolls than anything else and I was in Japan for a long time just because they're good and like I said they're everywhere and everyone loves them and they're really simple to make it home to so feeling for something simple and fun to make these are certainly it as well kids love them too and some people are a little squeamish about sea as well so here they are I hope you enjoy them as much as we do because these things are awesome so thanks for watching we appreciate life some comments please
