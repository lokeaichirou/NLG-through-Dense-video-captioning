 hey everybody thomas joseph here with another kitchen conundrum do your mashed potatoes look like these thick gloppy and pasty and not fluffy and delicious like the ones we're all looking for well today I'm going to show you how to make the fluffiest mashed potatoes and to start that it's all about the potatoes that you pick there are two different types of potatoes that you want to use for the fluffiest mashed potatoes the first one would be a russet potato or an Idaho Potato and this potato has the highest starch content of the potato family so this is a very good potato to use and what I'm using today is next in line which is a Yukon Gold potato has a high starch it has a little bit more moisture to it but it really has a beautiful color and a wonderful creamy consistency and also a delicious flavor and I'm just going to peel off the skin here instead of boiling potatoes which introduces more moisture to your mashed potatoes we're going to steam them now steaming the technique of steaming the water vapors when steaming are at the same temperature as if you were to boil potatoes so that same 212 degrees but the advantage of steaming is that you're not introducing an excessive amount of moisture into the potatoes which gives you this kind of gloppy mashed potato so steaming is really the best way to cook your potatoes I'm just going to cut these in half and leave them in pretty big chunks and so now I'm going to steam the potatoes now this is 2 pounds of the Yukon Gold potatoes I have a steamer basket set over about two inches of boiling water and just arrange them in a single layer so that they cook at a uniform rate and these big pieces will probably take anywhere from 20 to 25 minutes to steam so it's been about 25 minutes and our potatoes are wonderfully steamed using a ricer creates the fluffiest mashed potatoes I'm going to take potatoes and put them into the center of the ricer and this this well here is called the hopper of the rice or a little fact for you and let's see I'll fill it up about two-thirds of the way and then all you do is you press down kind of like a citrus press you press down and the wonderful steamed potatoes are going to rice out of the bottom and the sides of the ricer try avoid using a food processor a blender or even those handheld mixers because what they do is they shear through the potatoes the starch granules and they create a very gluey mashed potato so avoid machines and now for the richness I have equal parts milk and butter so 1/2 cup of milk 1/2 cup of butter and to that I'm going to add the seasonings because I really don't want to mix a lot here it's kind of like baking you don't want to overwork your potatoes so I'm going to have a hefty pinch maybe too hefty pinches of kosher salt you need the salt here because you're really seasoning 2 pounds of potatoes I like the flavor of black pepper so I'm going to use black pepper and just a small pinch of that to the heated milk and butter mixture and just swirl that around so that the salt and the pepper kind of dissolve into the liquid now if you wanted to flavor your mashed potatoes this is the opportunity to do so you could steep in with your milk and your butter some rosemary some garlic any aromatics that you would like in your mashed potatoes pour over your buttermilk mixture and then give it a stent 'el stir so this is nicely combined and all you have to do is serve this in a nice warm serving bowl so that your mashed potatoes don't get cold there you have it 3 simple tricks to achieve the fluffiest mashed potatoes for your Thanksgiving table enjoy you
