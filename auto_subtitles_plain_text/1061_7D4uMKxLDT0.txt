 what's up guys this is dairy cows from dhf TNS calm and today I'm gonna show you guys how to make my bodybuilding chicken parmesan it's quick simple and more than calorie friendly so let's get to it the first thing you're gonna do is take out one and a half pounds or 24 ounces of chicken breast trim the fat off of them and then cut each piece and a half this way so for every chicken breast that you have you should end up with two pieces that are about this big after you slice your chicken breast put it off to the side and then take out two bowls one small one and one medium size one one thing I do want to mention really quick if you want to prep enough for the whole week you can easily double or even triple this recipe now the first thing we're gonna add into the small bowl is two extra-large egg whites and then one tablespoon of olive oil go ahead and lightly mix those together the first thing you're going to add into the medium-sized bowl is 2/3 a cup or 60 grams of whole wheat bread crumbs whether or not you want to use seasoned ones is completely up to you and then 8 tablespoons or 40 grams of grated Parmesan cheese mix both of those together next pre-heat your oven on 450 take out a baking sheet and then coat it with some nonstick cooking spray put your chicken breasts onto your baking sheet take out a pastry brush and then brush each chicken breast with your wet mix after you brush your chicken breast dip it into your dry mix if there's any dry mix left over just evenly distribute it across the top of your chicken breast last before the oven cook the top of each chicken breast with some nonstick cooking spray and then into the oven on 450 for 20 minutes after 20 minutes take them out flip them over and then evenly distribute half a cup or 123 grams of pasta sauce across the tops of them and then 3/4 a cup or 84 grams of reduced fat mozzarella cheese after that put them back into the oven on 450 for around 5 to 10 minutes or until your cheese is melted after 10 minutes for me it does look done so I'm just gonna take it out and there is your bodybuilding chicken parmesan three quick tips one you can use whatever type of pasta sauce you want today I'm using a no-salt-added one but for example sometimes I like it spicy so use a spicy pasta sauce too you can eat this with quinoa rice pasta beans Laffy Taffy or whatever you prefer and three a silicone pastry brush is a great investment for your kitchen this one only costs around $8 ship is easy to clean dishwasher safe and will last you forever I do post a link to this one in the description below as you guys saw the chicken parmesan is done so now I'm just gonna try it buy it so if Scarface was a bodybuilder that dealt chicken parmesan instead of cocaine this would be the best seller all the flavors of a chicken parmesan are they're absolutely delicious as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 1515 43 grams of fat 55 grams of carbs and 227 grams of protein so if you divide this up in as six servings like I do in each serving there's going to be around 252 calories 7 grams of fat 9 grams of carbs and 38 grams of protein so I have a question for you guys since this was one of my favorite meals growing up what were some of your favorites let me know in the comments below alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you like this recipe please go ahead and hit that thumbs up on it motivates me to keep making these if you haven't already subscribed and you'd like to can do so by clicking right there on the screen coming up by subscribing you'll get email every week telling you upload a new video comments or suggestions go down below I do try and respond to everybody thank you guys again for watching I got some chicken parm to finish stay healthy
