 hey everyone happy st. Patty's Day today I'm gonna make Irish dish it's called colcannon and even though I am part Irish I kind of grew up with Japanese food so I don't really know anything about Irish food stuff that it has potatoes in it so pretty much this is it's a blend of creamy mashed potatoes and you can add in a cabbage or kale bacon ham milk butter whatever you like it's almost a side dish so you can serve it with sausage or corned beef or chicken or whatever so if you're interested in that just keep on watching okay I just found out that um my dad used up the last of the potatoes so instead of potatoes I'm going to substitute in cauliflower so if you just dean the cauliflower and puree it it's going to taste exactly like potatoes and trust me it's gonna be good it's kind of a global calorie version now I'm also also I'm gonna add some rutabaga because I want to get rid of it if you don't like rutabaga and you don't know the taste of it I think just stick with the cauliflower because it's going to taste more like mashed potatoes so I have a head of one head of cauliflower and I'm just gonna cut into florets and I have about a quarter of a rutabaga rutabaga I don't know rutabaga or something all you need to do is just cut up into small pieces and you just want to Finley slice the cabbage and just kind of break up the leaves so they're all separate I'm just gonna add my vegetables into my pressure cooker you can use a double boiler or anything to just steam the vegetables this just takes some two minutes so do it on high pressure for two minutes all you need is half an onion see when I just cook your onions first so I just added some chicken stock that I made last night and this is just because I don't really like using a lot of oil so I'm just going to add some cabbage now what would also be better if you could like maybe roast the onions and cabbage as well as the cauliflower and rutabaga would have a nicer flavor but like I said I don't really like using oils so this is probably like the most healthiest way you could do it I'll also add in the garlic and then just add some salt and pepper so now that my cauliflower and rutabaga are steamed I'm just gonna blend it now I'm just gonna add some chicken bullion to give it some flavor now just add the cabbage and onions instead of bacon or ham I'm just gonna add some Turkey and if you don't want to use rutabaga just pure cauliflower is fine and I find that just the cauliflower actually tastes like mashed potatoes and that's the final dish I added some chopped green onions and some toasted pepitas and sunflower seeds and the pitas are just the shell pumpkin seeds and I'm also serving it with grilled chicken on top of sauteed kale and that's just parmesan alright guys this is what it looks like I think you just used two cauliflower wouldn't have such a yellow look to it this is really good it's really really creamy you know I don't even think I'm gonna make mashed potatoes with potatoes anymore and I think the only thing that's missing in this dish is some good old beer so come pie guys mmm juicy
