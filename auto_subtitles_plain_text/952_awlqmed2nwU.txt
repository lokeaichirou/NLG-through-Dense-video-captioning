 many a time people say to me Manju cooking curries takes ages and it's really difficult so I'm gonna show you how to make a quick chicken curry using a few basic ingredients and five simple spices here are my ingredients I've got some onions chicken breasts the spices turmeric cumin coriander garam masala and chili powder some tomato puree a bit of ginger and some garlic so first of all we're gonna heat some oil up and I'm gonna use vegetable oil for this once the oil is heated up I'm going to add my sliced onions now you can chop your onions but for speed I've just sliced them give that a quick mix and break up some of the onion pieces and separate them if you haven't already once you've done that add your chicken and I've chopped mine into two centimeter cubes bite-sized pieces and give it another stir and you fry your chicken and onions for about 8 to 10 minutes until the chicken turns white on the outside you must cook your chicken thoroughly for at least 10 minutes but because I've broken them into bite-size pieces the process should be quicker but I'm going to definitely give this 10 minutes and while the chicken is frying away along with the onions you tip in your garlic which you can chop slice or crush and give it another stir the next stage is to mix up my spices with the tomato puree and oil and make a curry paste out of them so I'm gonna tip them in a little Bowl add some tomato puree and just a touch of oil and the oil eases the blending so just stir it all up and as you can see here it's a lovely thick curry paste the chicken is cooked on the outside as you can see and it's beginning to actually turn brown as well and now I'm going to add my lovely curry paste and it goes let the spices fry along with the chicken for about a minute and if you want a thicker sauce just add a touch of water about six tablespoons give it another stir put the heat on low and let that simmer for about five minutes and then you add your grated ginger now I've peeled the outer layer of the ginger it doesn't matter if you keep the skin on but I've peeled it and just grate it on top and you can add ginger at the end of cooking or during the cooking process that's lovely well the chickens done it's looking lovely and red so I'm just going to add some chopped coriander leaves on top for garnish take it off the heat and serve these with pita breads or some plain basmati rice and there's your quick chicken curry you
