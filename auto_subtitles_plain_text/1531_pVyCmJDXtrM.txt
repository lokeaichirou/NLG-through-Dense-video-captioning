 today on Nico's kitchen it is the king of kings it is the ultimate grilled cheese we're making my croque monsieur so firstly just over a low to medium heat we're going to be making our bechamel sauce for our croque monsieur so first thing i'm gonna be putting in is some butter now that it's melted down i'm going to be adding in some just some plain flour and we just want to mix the flour around it will start to clump up we're making a beautiful little roux here it'll start to clump up as you can see that's normal we just want to cook out that flour for about a minute so after about a minute we're now going to be adding in some milk and just stir that around and now we want to mix this until we get all the lumps out and the sauce starts to get thick so just add a little bit more milk just keep incorporating that give it another stir and this is exactly what I want a beautiful smooth bechamel sauce so now that it's nice and smooth just a couple of more additions to it just a pinch of nutmeg don't go overboard with it and season with salt and pepper and we'll just give that a mix through now some people add some cheese into their bechamel sauce I don't I just leave it like this but if you want to add some Parmesan cheese something that's got quite a sharp taste to it then go for it so that is our bechamel sauce done I'm gonna put this aside just for the meantime and we'll get started on building our croque monsieur for the bread I'm using a linseed loaf I made myself but you could use any hearty style bread for this butter all sides and place under the grill until just golden brown on one side sprinkle grated Gruyere cheese and then place a slice of prosciutto or deli ham down repeat this process with another layer of cheese more prosciutto and then more cheese place a slice of bread on the top and spread with vegetable sauce then sprinkle another layer of cheese and place it in a hot oven at 220 degrees Celsius for 6 minutes then bring it out and spread Dijon mustard over the top and then you guessed it more cheese place back into the oven for another three minutes slice and serve immediately and now let's get stuck into this bad boy so I just love a croque monsieur they are just perfect for sharing too and there are so many different regional variations of this french classic but let me tell you i love it this way I love the cheese the mustard the vegetable the bread more cheese the prosciutto more cheese the bread it is just incredible it is really really tasty very easy to do quick to put together like I said perfect for sharing you put a nice bowl of tomato soup down or something and it will just be absolutely amazing please give this one a try you can do different variations you can put some deli ham I use prosciutto on this occasion but you can use any ham that you want to you can switch up the cheese it's completely up to you you can put the mustard inside the sandwich I like to have it on the top because I like that grilled mustard it really intensifies the flavor when it's grilled on the outside so many different variations of this you'd even put a an egg on the top and I becomes a croque madame so there's again different variations of this please in any case give it a try because you just gotta fall in love with it
