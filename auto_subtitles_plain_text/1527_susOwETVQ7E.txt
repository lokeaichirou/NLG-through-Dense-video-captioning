 tonight we're having General Tso's chicken with steamed jasmine rice and broccoli welcome to Tessa's kitchen yes this recipe has a lot of ingredients and yes it looks intimidating but it's not it is well worth the effort I promise you this will taste much better than the restaurant version and probably is a lot healthier let's get started and have some fun I have here about a pound and a half of cubed chicken to whisk eggs about a cup of cornstarch 1/2 a teaspoon of salt black pepper and garlic powder and I'm going to add everything to the chicken and mix well you you can get this recipe and more on my Facebook and Google+ page remember to come and give me a visit you will see a lot of people use flour to code their chicken for this recipe but the cornstarch is going to give it a much crispier texture I'm going to refrigerate the chicken for 20 to 30 minutes while I get everything else prepared and for the other ingredients you're going to need about two cups of chicken broth two tablespoons of corn starch three tablespoons of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce one tablespoon of sesame oil two tablespoons of rice vinegar two to three tablespoons of sugar I'm using palm sugar one nice thumb size julienne ginger about a tablespoon of minced garlic this is optional we like a little heat about 12 chili peppers and a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce about six scallions the whites julienne six galleons the greens and some sesame seeds and to your chicken broth you're going to add the soy sauce and the hoisin sauce don't worry I go back later and scoop that out the sesame oil the rice vinegar the sugar and as you make this you're going to have your level of sweetness that you like the cornstarch now I'm adding the heat the chili garlic sauce and the chili peppers those are optional and the green scallions for the garlic I'm going to add all the garlic except about a teaspoon I'm going to save that for later give that a good stir and set to the side for 10 or 15 minutes to let all those flavors combine place three to four cups of vegetable oil in your wok and bring up the heat between 375 and 400 Here I am using a cooking thermometer because this is a crucial part you want to maintain your frying temperature at 375 if you don't your chicken will be soggy I'm going to fry this chicken in batches of six to eight pieces at a time this will help maintain my oil temperature since these are nice sized pieces I'm frying four to five minutes until they are golden brown you then place them on a paper towel to help absorb some of the excess oil here I'm using some leftover coffee filters I don't use them anymore but they still have a good use you and this is what they look like after cooking and nice crispy crust and still moist inside on medium-high heat place about a tablespoon of oil in your wok add the white scallions the ginger and the remaining teaspoon of minced garlic and stir for about a minute you now add your sauce slowly and be careful bring up to a boil and stir and you will see the sauce thicken you ah it is smelling so good you now add your chicken and stir just to get the chicken pieces covered with the sauce and it's ready you add your sesame seeds on top and put in your serving bowl yes it tastes as good as it looks and even better it is absolutely awesome tonight I am surfing with the side of jasmine rice and steamed broccoli you I hope you try this recipe is well worth the effort and you are going to love it thanks for joining me here in Tessa's kitchen remember to hit the like button and also subscribe to my youtube channel for future videos you can also find me on Google+ and Facebook until next time enjoy
