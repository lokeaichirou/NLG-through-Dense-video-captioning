 I'm going to show you how to cook Thai style sausage fried rice for this recipe I'm using four cups of cooked rice or you can use leftover rice from another day too and for sausages onion ginger garlic paste and fry eggs and using white part of leek and one carrot this is optional if you like to add vegetables in your fried rice always you can if not spring onions or you can use bok choy or any other kind of a vegetable tool to start and some oyster sauce and soy sauce and fish sauce so to start this recipe what I am going to do first is to fry the onion ginger garlic first I left my work on the stove and it's hot so I'm going to add the oil you can use vegetable oil or even any other kind of oil or even butter window oil is hot add the ginger garlic with the onion and fry that about two minutes with the onion mix is ready at the carrot with the sausages and cook that about two minutes until the carrots are tender don't overcook the vegetable has no color so just one or two minutes once the calais and the sausages are very cold take the vegetable aside and break the eggs one by one and cook the eggs without stirring for several minutes once the egg settle just scrambled it a little bit and cook the eggs properly before doing the next step so I scramble the eggs so it's ready so I'm going to mix it with the other ingredients now going to add the leeks and cook again another minute I forgot to show you the the most important ingredient in Thai style cooking red chillies or even any kind of Asian dish so if you don't like to add chillies you can omit this totally and if you like chillies you can add a little bit or take the seeds out took the air get the extra heat out so add the chillies and mix it with the vegetables and the sausages and then add the cooked rice you can always use the leftover rice in this recipe this is a really nice idea when you are a busy person you can just do this answer one for me and it's ready to have when you are busy so just mix it really well and cook it with the vegetables and the next step is to add all the other ingredients add the soy sauce about a tablespoon make sure in your and soy sauce it has lots of soul so you had to check the salt level and the fish sauce has the oyster sauce so mix that really well and cook it another minute and taste it and check the soil flavor so if it is not enough you can add more soy sauce and fish sauce and adjust the salt level now the last ingredient spring onions add it last minute so it keeps the color and the crunchiness and now it's really time Stein fried rice and I hope you will enjoy this recipe thank you for watching
