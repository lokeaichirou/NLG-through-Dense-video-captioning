 hi and welcome to the break kitchen no Indian meal is complete without a chapati or two so here's how to make them so to make these chapati is I've got one cup of chapati flour well you can use just plain all-purpose flour and I'll add in a third of a cup of water a pinch of salt and mix it to a soft dough now depending on your flour you might need to add in a little bit extra water are usually adding a teaspoon extra at a time until I feel the dough is gonna be nice and soft okay I've got a really nice soft dough here now I'll leave the dough on a lightly floured surface for about three or four minutes just to make sure it's really well mixed it's lovely and soft it's a bit like it's a bit like clay soft clay now I'll just put it back in the bowl cover it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes after the dough's have a good rest pop it on your board then we're gonna cook this into four pieces just from all the pieces into little balls now get yourself a flat pan over a medium high heat like and dust your work surface take one of the balls and kind of press it out to about two inch diameter with your fingers and thumb and then roll it out into a circle about six inches in diameter it's getting quite thin now keep turning it as you'll roll it and there can be more or less circular by the time you've finished all right I think I'm fairly happy with that I'm gonna take this across and let me dump them on a nice hot pan I'll just leave it sit there for about 20-30 seconds till after 20 seconds I'll flip it over and after another 20 or 30 seconds flip it over again whoops and you should notice it's starting to kind of puff up and when it starts to puff up use your spatula to help drive the air bubble through the chapati sometimes it won't put like a ball because you get a little hole develop and the steam escapes through that little hole rather than puffing up the chapati flip it over about every 20 seconds or so oh yes there we go there we go there it is look woof-woof-woof like a big puff ball play football with that flip that over one more time and when it's got these brown spots on it and he's puffed up like that he's cooked so we can pop it on the plate and get on for the next one now all I need is a nice steaming hot curry to eat these with chapatis are always best fresh but they will keep for a day or two in a plastic bag I hope you enjoy making your chip patties and do join me next time in the bread kitchen
