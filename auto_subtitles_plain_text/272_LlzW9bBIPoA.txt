 beef bourguignon a classic dish but I've got a little twist on it that always proved to be a hit to my pity Parisian restaurant and for my version I'm going to need that stale old baguette start off by coating the beef and flour so it's worth wearing the wrong dress getting dusted I'm dusting myself right now the flour will thicken the stew later I'm using beef Shin very big chunks I prefer doing big chunks takes a little bit longer but it's better than all those little chunks okay then sear the beef it will bring out the sugars in the meat and make it more flavor some lovely golden color when it caramelized on one side just turn it over almost oh that looks good remove the meat but keep the oil then add 150 grams of smoky bacon a handful of baby onions a clove of garlic and some cracked black pepper corns put the little black bits at the bottom actually makes us to take bit better so my herbs go in there sprig of rosemary Feeny it's pretty good time meat goes in there just bun it in red wine you should use wine you can add some drinks we're not good enough to drink is probably not good enough to trip and then 150 milliliters water add a teaspoon of salt and another of sugar teaspoon of tomato paste oh I forgot my glasses door just chopped they go in gonna flavor your stew as well they don't in the oven it goes about three hours hey Willa that's it for now and while that's doing away it's on to my delicious dumplings cut the stale baguette into small pieces and add some parsley then pour over 250 mils warm milk the staleness stops it going mushy let your bread soak up all that milk generous pinch of salt bit of black pepper nutmeg and in one egg to make everything stick together grab a wooden spoon give it a mix I need a tablespoon of flour all together looks like ready then all you need to do now to kind of squash them together it's about golf ball-sized shape those are the dumplings done to cook on each side they're starting to crisp up really lovely they were browning nicely I think it's time to get my stew out the oven hot Oh YUM oh it's bubbling away and now I just need to serve up I also put some chopped mushrooms in at the last minute to stop them getting soggy the French would serve this with tagliatelle pastel potatoes but I think these crispy like baguette dumplings fit the bill classic French recipe with a little twist for me
