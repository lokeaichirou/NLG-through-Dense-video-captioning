 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with an unbelievably incredibly great onion earring recipe these are the most incredible onion rings ever you know i'm normally pretty modest and humble it's one of the things that makes me so awesome but i have to say these are incredible best in the world alright so we're going to start with some regular flour and cornstarch so it's kind of similar to a tempura batter basically but there's my secret ingredient instant mashed potatoes believe it all right little Cayenne so I'm going to whisk up the dry ingredients and then I'm going to add club soda you have to get the exact amounts on food wishes we're going to stir that in which is just going to take a minute by the way don't worry about developing gluten or the batter is going to be tough it's not this is unbelievable that looks pretty thin there but as it sits the instant mashed potato even though it's just a little bit is going to swell up and absorb some of that liquid it's going to be perfect all right we're going to put some panko breadcrumbs the other secret in a shallow pan you can get those in any store stop emailing me you can't find panko you can big supermarkets have it all right I like to use not super big but kind of medium yellow onions do not cut them any thicker than a quarter-inch otherwise they won't cook separate them into rings I didn't really need to tell you that right alright so there we go this is only like 10 minutes later our batter has thickened slightly and it's perfect we're going to dump in a few rings at a time make sure they get coated with the batter which is pretty much going to drip off but enough is going to stick on there to latch onto these panko bread crumbs these sharp incredibly crispy bread crumbs by the way do as I say not as you just saw me do use a separate fork for the crumbs and a separate fork to pull them out of the batter much easier all right we're going to fry these and I'm not doing a deep fry demo just standard 350 I'm using olive oil but any standard vegetable oil frying oil is going to work it's going to go maybe three two and a half three minutes and when it comes out that magic formula that I've come up with with the potato and the panko produces the most crispiest onion ring I've ever ever anywhere all right now you can hear this that's not fake sounds that is the actual crunchiness and now you just have to listen to this come on unbelievable okay that was really bland because there was no salt make sure you solve these generously before serving with some very fine sea salt so it sticks on there and let me finish this I know this is so rude but come on admit it you want to hear it and that's it super crispy amazing onion rings and here's really the ultimate test lots of different recipes are crunchy right when they come out of the oil okay the real test does it stay crunchy what you're going to see and hear now is literally to the second fifteen minutes later these sat on this rack for 15 minutes and this is what they sound like Your Honor I rest my case anyway I hope you give it a try go to the site all the ingredients are there and as always enjoy
