 okay and then we're gonna cook our Kobe to go with our some John and our Moo Chin's I think what I'm gonna do take out my broiling pan I like to put a little bit of foil Japan because there is because there's so much sugar gonna be a really sticky mess to clean up we'll take our kalbi now we'll line it up in the pan now this kalbi isn't very thickly cut so it won't take forever to cook of course if you can do it on the grill that's even better and then you get all that delicious grill flavor to go with it so here's your cobby it's a nice dinner for two you've got your Moo chims which we can arrange on the plate on your side dish plate so you got rice and meat that we're gonna stick in the broiler for about four minutes per side I mean you have your traditional Korean barbecue
