 here brains mark tom is a home outdoor expert and today I'm bringing you an awesome recipe this is how you cook brats you start out in the kitchen and you simmer it in a pan I'll go through those steps in a minute and then you transfer it to your grill and I'm gonna cook this over charcoal because I think charcoal is the way to go I do use gas and I like it it's nice and convenient and there's ways to make it taste really good but today I'm gonna go all out with the charcoal so let's go through the steps okay first before you get started with this I want to give a shout out to my friend John the game in this recipe John if you see this call me I will buy you a beer craft beer anyway this John is from Wisconsin he's a Packers fan and they know a thing about grilling and he said Believe It or Not Miller High Life you said cook it in this for 20 minutes we're going to pour this into I've got a smaller cast iron pan here it's been warming up a little bit and you know I haven't had Miller I well it's been a long winter this is my first time grilling brats for this season so it's been a long time that I've had Miller High Life it's not the type of beer normally drink but that's the best way to cook brats hmm yeah all right interesting stuff and I got three brats here and what you do is you keep this up enough so you just see it just a little bit of steam coming off and let it go like that for 20 minutes you don't want to overcook it where you split the skin on it so let's check back after they've been cooking here they are just underway and the pans got to warm up a little bit more it's not steaming yet but you can see the beer is bubbling all right now you can see I stepped outside I've got the charcoal chimney starter going this is made by whoever this one works awesome just a couple sheets of crumpled newspaper light it and probably 20 minutes later we'll have just the blazing fire it's awesome let's go back inside okay yeah put the brats and maybe hard to see but just there's a little bit of steam coming off the pan it's not that hot so it's not gonna split the skin all right here the brats are underway about three to four minutes I've turned them once nice little color there and look to the side here this is the kind of beer I enjoy really hey guess what kind of beer I'm drinking and this is gonna be my first giveaway if you're the first one to guess what kind of drinking I will ship you this free brand-new Weber bamboo skewer set model 60608 so good luck and the rules are you cannot guess until somebody else guesses and if you guys aren't figuring it out I'll give you a hint along the way good luck yep and here we are back to the grill nice and slow low heat no need to rush the best way to do it and this is what I love about charcoal look at the smoke that rolls off just that extra flavor that you get from charcoal
