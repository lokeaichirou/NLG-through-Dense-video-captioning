 welcome to jobless kitchen today i am making signature table a dish that's monkey doll that's tall money so why it's called the al-bukhari let me tell you because we will be putting butter than this plus we'll be using heavy whipping cream in this so this is like a real Punjabi dish so just want to let you guys know that the alba Kuni means the that is black earth with kidney beans the chana Pathan doesn't go in this recipe so let me show you recipe which I have from my childhood and this is my mother signature dish Plus whenever you go to Punjab to any to ABBA that's it ah hostile da I am going to present you guys today so let me introduce you to the ingredients today here doll your you'll see I have already soaked this Thal get some kidney beans so I have used around one cup of Thal with you can say like half half half cup but less than that of kidney beans so not much of kidney beans but this is the doll which I have already solved from for 5 hours so we will be just putting it in pressure cooker and give like 1 or 2 vessels then it would be done then what else we need for this is we will be putting some long dad's cloths cloves in this with some ginger in this so ginger should be this way it should be like a string you can cut with your you know hands or you can grate it like strings then for Turkana that is for tempering you will be needing some jeera that is cumin seeds some finely chopped fresh garlic some onions some cilantro then here is the Puri I have already pureed around 4 Tomatoes 4 medium size 2 Tomatoes Puri actually gives a nice texture and color to the dark McVie that's the reason we are using Puri and here is my butter what else we need is some salt some garam masala that and some red chilli powder with some heavy whipping cream so ginger I'll be using in the pressure cooker so let's start the process so whenever you soak the whole or anything like kidney beans also juice and water only to give it a you know pressure a pressure cook the dal use that water only don't take that water out so I will be using this water so here goes our that I have already added cloves in it so you have to use around 8 9 cloves in this if you want you can use black cardamom big cardamom you can use that too but I am avoiding this this is like for now daily use so if it's a party time you should use that oh it will give a nice flavor so here goes the its around one cup of thought I would say and around 3 cups of water in it and here goes ginger so you have to use ginger this family and some oil in this some people put turmeric in this but signature dish of a job doesn't have any turmeric in it so Maki dal that is the almani no turmeric in it so here let me close the cooker and I'll just put it putting it on a high flame and I putting it on a high flame and well you don't give it a whistle two or three whistles then it would've been down in the meanwhile I'll just start making Turki of this - here it goes my butter about 2 tablespoon of butter let it get melted then we'll be using the ginger at all don't let it brown so I will be using some cumin seeds cumin seeds actually it's optional so I'll not be using much of cumin seeds in this and ginger I have already put in my pressure cooker and you can see it's already on high heat here will not be wasting time will be making Turki in the meanwhile our dal is getting pressure cooker so my tada cumin seeds are done here goes the garlic so you don't burn tablespoon of garlic these arrested making a circle because Punjabis are first you see my other recipes USD Punjabis ourselves are always we use a lot of circle like and here goes my onions so I am using around 1 medium sized onion so that's the reason I am again saying we have to be generous in using all the things in this my garlic is done here goes onions just clear it for until it's like golden brown onions are done so here goes my fresh meat they feed under so I am using at home for William size tomatoes if like it you have more quantity of salt so you can put more to Madison this so I'll just say cover this with a slit and give it like five minutes and once it will once it will exert water sorry oil from it then it's done it's around x five to seven minutes and you can see it have has already lost it has started losing oil from it that means it stands for massage masala should be properly done so now I am going to put some salt in it sort according to your taste I will be using around 1 teaspoon of salt some red chilli powder if you want you can use more I don't use much and you can use green chillies also in the meanwhile my just cooker will be getting this is as my cooker have just you oughta gristle I can get the aroma of ginger and cloves from my machi doll that's just nothing it's just getting boiled so once you will make this way you will get that aroma from the start so my masala is almost done I just keep on more whistles to my doll and then I will just put in the turgor let me see how my doll looks like look at the texture look at the kidney beans over here it's some ginger over this so we are just gonna take this doll and put it in my saucepan and it I have already done the tampering so I have just put all the doll in this and I will just keep it on there between medium to high heat for around 15-20 minutes the actual way of making doll in Punjab is we keep this in the morning and it's it will be done by the evening so what we call it as in Punjabi is karna karna means we have to put it on this low or between low heat and let it cook you know slowly steadily and gives a nice flavor and color till evening but yeah if you want a good texture keep this after putting a tempering and all this keep this for around 1 hour or so to get a royal taste but I will not be taking much time I will give like 15-20 minutes and I just cover this with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for a while it's around 15 minutes still yet and it's still on like medium heat and I'll just give like 15 more minutes to get professional dark which is like petit with all so what I have to do is right now to get a good texture I will be using the spatula and I will be mashing some dal this way so this will give a very nice texture to the DAR and this is the way the dhaba people make the are in punjab so you can use the masher but we are not mashing hold on but we are less mashing like somewhat dull in this so it will give a thick gravy also and adds value and adds flavor to the god so I'll just cover it with a lid for another 15 minutes check back in 15 minutes because I want to show you guys a professional royal dal makhani the all is like on slow cooking for around 30 minutes now look at the texture look at the color so this is the consistency of the dog which we actually need and which we actually have in the Dabas so now it's a time to just turn off the heat and use your heavy whipping cream first I will be using some cilantro here goes some cilantro and now put some heavy whipping cream use that much you can you know because that adds a rich flavour to the star just ER this and we are done so you can see the rich creamy color in the dal here goes dal makhani rich creamy dal makhni Punjabi dish just try out this recipe the way I have told you you are really gonna love it and try out my more recipes hit the like button leave me comments your solutions are always welcome and subscribe on my channel for you know knowing more videos as we are coming out with many more medial videos thank you for watching bye bye
