 let's make bangers and mash and we'll go over a couple of you know basic sauce making principles here we have a nice beef soup bone and it's been roasting in my cast-iron pan here's its little brother shorter fatter and both roasting in the cast iron pan and now that they're caramelized I'm going to add in onion carrot lots of garlic celery some bay leaf and I'm going to move it all around get all that fat coating it because there's a lot of fat that's come off of these bones and i want to quote these vegetables in that fat because that's going to help them to brown going in the oven notice that they're kind of cut into julienne and you know if you're making a big batch of veal stock you're not going to cut them that way because they're going to burn very quickly but I want this to go fast now I'm gonna work it I'm going to watch it I want it to caramelize quickly you see it's already really cooked down and the sugars are coming out of it it's beginning to caramelize I moved it around I'm putting it back in the oven I want to brown this quickly because I'm making a small batch and once I get the color I want I'm going to use these these ingredients to build a sauce basically it's going to be my gravy also unlike a veal stock I'm actually going to keep these vegetables in the sauce it'll push them right through my food mill and make a rustic gravy you'll see here I'm cooking them down further this now that I'm I'm now cooking them on top of the stove at a medium heat just cooking them down cooking them down notice how brown and caramelized they are this is a lot of flavor here I'll begin to deglaze with just water i'm not even using stock it's just water i added butter into this big sauce pot and now i'm going to great potato into that butter and this is going to be my roux it's not a root a roux is actually butter and flour but i'm going to use that potato mixture to thicken my gravy here's some potatoes this is going to be our mash I'm baking them off i'm not going to boil them i'm not a big fan of boiled potatoes for mashed potato I like to bake them you get a lot more flavor notice our potato that's in our sauce pot starting to brown nicely we're starting to sort of sizzle and caramelize the potato and we're still going to have the starchiness which is going to thicken the sauce add all the ingredients in its going to begin to thicken right away look at out dark and tasty looking at is you've got to really work those potatoes off the bottom or eventually they will begin to burn continue to add a little bit of water just to deglaze the pan and you know the bones aren't really submerged but they will be almost and we'll keep on cooking them and all that nice tasty marrow that's in them is going to come out notice it's beginning to come out now that's going to add a ton of flavor to this sauce I'm boiling it pretty hard because I don't mind if it's foggy you know if you're making classic sauces you don't to boil things hard because you don't want them to be foggy you want them to be sort of transparent it's not a problem here we're pushing all these vegetables to the food mill so they can be as foggy as can be and I'm cooking it hard and fast to get the job done I browned off my sausage in the meantime bangers and mash these are bangers though like they're not classic English bangers I'm just using any sausage I've got some bratwurst sausages and I've got some various different you know mild italian sausages their sausages are inexpensive for the most part they ought to be i wouldn't pay very much money for sausages because basically sausages are a great way for butchers to utilize scrap and you ought to utilize your scrap at home to push my baked potatoes through my food mill did not wash it and now i'm going to put my gravy through the food mill not on top of the potatoes right away though into a different pot but i don't mind a little bit of residual mashed potato hanging around on that food mill because it's just going to help thicken the gravy and notice how this machine works this food mill I use it quite a lot for sauces and for mashed potato and various things stalks it pushes there's a little paddle which pushes the liquid and the saw leads down through a fine sort of strainer and basically makes it makes the mixture smooth and it's going to allow us to hold on to all those lovely vegetables which we browned off originally and it's going to make the sauce quite rich and unique actually it's going to be our gravy so we're going to serve our sausages our bangers on top of the mash with our lovely gravy simple but super thrifty and extremely tasty you can't go wrong with this for an easy dinner for you and your loved ones and here's a nice little mini version of it if you have a little cocktail party a slice of sausage on a little baguette with a tiny quenelle of potato on top and a little bit of gravy great little cannon pay for your cocktail party
