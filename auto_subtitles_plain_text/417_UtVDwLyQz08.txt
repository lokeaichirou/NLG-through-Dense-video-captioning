 cheese kitchen today I'm going to show you how to make fried chicken and Indian style for this you will need two chicken legs or any part of the chicken you wish I have taken chicken legs and with skin is very necessary and I've made slit take 1/2 a cup of curd half a cup of milk and whisk it well now add chilli powder and salt and whisk everything so this is the marinade that the chicken is going to get soaked for at least five to six hours we're soaking in a liquid mixture for the chicken to be really soft and juicy so just make sure that you immerse the chicken really well inside and marinate it in the fridge and not in the freezer now after five six hours of marination these are the three products that you'll have the marinated chicken the masala which contains one spoon of chili powder 1 spoon of coriander powder half a spoon of garam masala half a spoon of turmeric powder half a spoon of pepper powder and mix everything well with water and in this plate I have all-purpose flour with garlic powder just mix everything now take the chicken out and apply the masala on the chicken like this and toss over the flour make sure you toss the entire chicken properly with the flour mixture and fry it I usually fry on medium heat on each side for three minutes and then high on two minutes on each side this makes that you can cook well and also turn out to be really crispy so this is fried chicken Indian style a spicy version of fried chicken thanks so much for watching
