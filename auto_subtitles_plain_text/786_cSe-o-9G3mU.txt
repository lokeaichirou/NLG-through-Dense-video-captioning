 hey welcome back to another big meet Sunday thanks for sticking with me today we're going to do something for a great friend of mine Linda over at Linda's pantry her YouTube channel is 255 saige if you've not heard of this lady go check her out she is full of amazing recipes and she also does a lot of food storage and canning and vacuum sealing things like that so if you're interested in that as well definitely a great resource to check out she's having a contest and basically she's asking for one of our favorite recipes and I struggled with this because I like food I don't have any favorite so basically we're going to do some tacos today okay thanks for coming back so we've got our carne asada steak and we've got onion some jalapeno peppers green onions and a boatload of sarong launch row cilantro though we're going to get our skirt steak all seasoned up here skirt steak is great for this it's got a lot of fat in it you can see these fat layers down here tons of flavor so we're going to throw down a little pepper some onion powder a little garlic powder and then chili powder one of my favorite items to dress this up with and instead of salt I use adobo seasoning the stuff I get from my local butcher seems to be really salty and so it's kind of got an interesting chili flavor but it's salty too so that really works out nicely some cumin it's kind of got that Latin thing going on for you a little bit of cumin and just going to kind of rub that in and we're going to do the same thing to the other side of this and then we're going to get it out on the grill so I'll grill it and bring it back in and we'll take the tacos from there so steaks around the grill also those green onions that you saw here those are also hot on the grill grilled green onions on a taco is just special if you know what I'm saying so yeah specialist I said that so anyway I'm going to cut up some onion I like to have a little bit onion and a little bit of cilantro nice nice chopped cilantro onions so we're just going to get this onion chopped nice and small and then for the cilantro I just usually just try to get the main leafy part I'm not real picky about it most of it I don't use I don't mind a little bit of stems either but I'll just crumple it up like this and try to keep it in that nice tight little wad and then just go through it with a knife like that and then kind of come out at a different angle just get those stems chopped up a little and bada bing bada boom doing with that and we'll get these Japanese all cut up and seated let's get these dice up and I know Linda definitely likes her spicy stuff - she's I've seen her do some cooking with it yep Mystikal all right so there's going to be our little pile of jalapenos I'm go out and probably flip flip that steak over right now check on the onions and when we get back we're going to toast us up some tortillas and it'll be real close to Taco Time stick around hey all right so we're back and we're going to take care of those tortillas now what I typically do is not light the wrong burner on the stove though now I have got I got one of these childproof ovens where if you turn it on and then turn it back off you can't turn it back on for like 10 seconds I don't even have kids Don thank you okay so we're going to do our tortillas I use nice small corn tortillas that's kind of my pleasure if you will right on the burner to turn it down a little bit also what I like to do is a little cheese going on so let this guy go for I don't know until it gets a little toasty on top but not too toasty and you'll see why I think that right when it starts to puff up like this that's where I'm going to flip it and I recommend using tongs and this is kind of a mess on your stove as well especially if you drop cheese like I just did but yeah you do one side just a little bit just to get it heated then you flip it over and you get it nice and toasty on the other side well the cheese is melting and that's that's where it's at right there so I did cut up my meat it's over here kind of chilling out well actually it's staying warm underneath of tinfoil and what I'm going to do right when I get about two or three of these guys I'll get them plated up we'll build our tacos alright so we are ready to build our tacos the purpose behind the cheese on the tortilla isn't just because it's damn good basically it's like a little wetsuit for the taco so you know get some meat down in there and you know I like lots of hot sauce can't go wrong there so typically I put so much on that it starts leaking out and then it kind of gets it all soggy so you got it you got to do that extra little layer little onion so we got our our meat down cheese some onion a little cilantro and maybe a little jalapeno on there I forgot my hot sauce Oh Lu katika good stuff a little bit goes a long way oh and that's plenty that's going to be pretty hot so let's try use one of these guys out oh I forgot gotta have a little guacamole right or avocado let's go everybody in there you go tacos one of my very favorite things yeah Wow a hot sauce is good so this is just a perfect lunch or dinner heck I'd even eat it for breakfast you do them any way you want there's twins of different variations you can do with them but most most of all they're simple and damn good too so thanks for watching Linda congratulations on all your subs 4700 last I checked appreciate the opportunity to join your contest you have a lot of great prizes looking forward to winning them all just kidding maybe mmm so that's it for talked of you guys you know the drill hit the sub button if you liked it you want to see more looking forward to having you take it easy YouTube
