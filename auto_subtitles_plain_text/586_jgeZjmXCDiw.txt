 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make meatloaf we're going to make it very very delicious but so much it's exactly like my mother's the only difference is we're using ground turkey instead of regular middle of mix which is ground beef veal and pork okay over the ingredients so we can get started you're gonna need some ground turkey from plain breadcrumbs one small onion finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic minced fresh flat-leaf parsley chopped raw egg and for the filling salami hard-boiled eggs sharp provolone Parmesan Reggiano and you're of course going to need a little olive oil salt and pepper very very easy ingredients and this is going to be absolutely delicious like I said it's exactly like my mother's the only difference is I mean the ground turkey instead of you know pork veal and beef which is your traditional meatloaf mix I'm you know if anytime using everything I'm making a recipe for ground beef you know Meat Loaf meatballs I try to sneak in some ground turkey in there just cuz it's leaner and if I can disguise it so that nobody will figure out what it is then I do it and this is one of those recipes it's so so so good you'll never know it's not you know ground beef pork and veal ok so what I'm going to do now is stick my 1 small onion and I finely diced I have two cloves of garlic that I've minced I'm just going to cook these up in a bath tablespoon available to look like soft and translucent about 5-6 minutes and then I melon cool for five minutes get my onion and garlic mixture cooling and while that happens I'm gonna chop up my Genoa salami and now traditionally in the talent whenever we make an Italian meal of closed-book mcdonnen and it's stuffed with like salami provolone and hard-boiled eggs so that's exactly what I'm going to do I'm just taking 4 ounces of salami and I'm just chopping it so it's nice and fine I mean not too fine that's perfect because you want to be able to you know bite down on it and as you know whenever making meatloaf or meatballs or anything like that you don't really want to work the meat too much otherwise it becomes tough so I'm going to do all my mixture what's at the bottom of the bowl mix everything together and then at the last minute put in the ground turkey this is my son I'm just breaking it up with my fingers a little bit it's all stick together once that's done I'm going to let my next let me continue to work on the filling okay we have that we have our cooked onions and garlic and this is going to add a lot of moisture to it and we want that especially because well we're using ground turkey and as we all know it can be a little dry one egg come on in there broke my own rule there and didn't break into a separate Bowl which you always should some fresh chopped parsley but 3 tablespoons 3 3 2 2 3 tablespoons as much as you like season this with salt pepper we want to make sure to season every element of the dish but don't go too crazy on the salt because the provolone is very salty very salty and so is the parmigiano channel which we're going to put it about 1/4 cup or so breathe tablespoon to 1/4 cup that's almost perfect great then I'm gonna add in my tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil again it really keeps things moist and let me just work this together as perfect put in a little bit of bread crumbs you really don't need a whole lot but a quarter cup and you can see I haven't put my hands in there yet so I'm gonna wait out til I want to wait till we put in the turkey for that so set this aside because now we're going to chop up our problem ok I'm just going to take off the very top grind and put this this sharp provolone it's very sharp so you really don't need a whole lot and just cut it in little pieces little bite-sized pieces like that got my perm alone over there now I forgot a very crucial ingredient Oh my mother would be freaking out right now if you saw this you need a little milk that's always her secret when she makes meatballs or meatloaf whatever I don't know why she just says it makes keeps everything really really moist and tender so we're going to put a couple tablespoons of milk I use whole milk you can use whatever you have on hand all right we got that done with our provolone chopped hard-boiled eggs on hand and the baking of a cookie sheet here baking sheet whatever you call it I'm going to put a little bit of olive oil on there so that doesn't stick now I'm going to add in our ground turkey gonna work this as little as possible before I pull my hands and then I want to see them Turkey with a little salt and pepper remember we have a lot of salty Parmesan Reggiano in there and provolone so be careful don't go too nuts all right cooks best tools go in there with your hand and mix the whole thing together okay my mixtures all mixed I'm just going to put it on this baking sheet now we are going to flatten this out okay flatten it out as much as possible get rid of any air bubbles otherwise you'll get a slice of meatloaf that's like hollow which don't work all right flying it out get rid of bubbles perfect now we're going to stuff it right down in the middle we're going to take half of a provolone which I know it doesn't seem like a lot but it's so so strong you're really overpowered the whole thing if you put too much we're going to take hard-boiled eggs in everything stuffed in Italian household anytime I'm making I don't know bake see do anything like that we always put hard-boiled eggs put the rest of the pro-1 around it like that and now just with your hands putting this closer to me with my hands I'm just going to work this together to bury the eggs and the prologue perfect look at that thing beauty okay oh we got to mention pretty you oven to 350 degrees so it's waiting for you and this puppy is going to go in there for about 45 to fifty-five minutes by which it should be perfect by then all right and she goes 45 minutes and 45 minutes is probably ready so inch goes my meatloaf is done been cooking for 45 minutes and you can see crack a little bit the top that's perfectly fine that just means that I'm doing such a good job at sealing you know the top but either way it's delicious now let this cool for a couple minutes I'm just going to actually use my parchment paper as a guide to transfer this onto my platter here we go smells so good smells just like my mother's meatloaf that provolone is strong but I'm telling you makes this out of this world okay slice it up then give it a bite I love the end I love the crispy ends oh yeah look at that you can see you can see the parsley you can see the onions you have a little bit of egg the cheese is melted all around the egg the salami when you try this recipe you're gonna go nuts no more boring dried out meat loaf mmm Wow mmm so good so so so good night Italy we don't eat meatloaf or the graving read it with like bread sauce or plain as is which I prefer if you want to make a quick little gravy over the top go right ahead but I suggest serving the just like this or with a little marinara sauce perfect leftovers best meatloaf sandwiches you've ever had Wow Oh how big guys I'm enjoy spending time with me so get this recipe on the recipes check out my website www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam visit you
