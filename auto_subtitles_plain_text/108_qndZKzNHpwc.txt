 welcome to sushi 101 today we're going to show you the basics of sushi to talk about something ingredients and demonstrate how easy it is for you to take my counter and bring this to your home so let's start off with what you're working with couple ingredients you need to pick up starting with the naughty put the dried seaweed you can find these in most Asian stores here in town usually come together in one piece like this what we're gonna do today is we're gonna cut it in half and work with half a sheet of nori the second ingredients you can work with is your rice they don't come prepackaged like this there's a whole process than making the rice you're basically doing one cup of rice and we're using short grain caliban's - 1 cup of water when you're done making your rice you'll add a bit of solution to it it's usually 1/4 of a cup of solution to 1 cup of rice being made the type of rice that we're using here is sushi rice the term sushi refers to the rice and not to the general tip before we'd ever working today we'll be making 2 types of sushi one will be the California style inside out Maki and second one will be a hammer we make in a California and the spice of tune so let's begin with our pad a sheet of rice and for your spicy tuna roll we'll be using scallions and spicy tuna mix this mix consists of hockey or yellowfin tuna chopped up and mixed with a combination sriracha sauce and our own special house sauce our house sauce is a spicy spicy aioli here we call it a raw sauce you can substitute any type of spicy sauce that you want I've seen people use some Tabasco and jalapenos but spicy tuna is a universal term for anything where you take your fish kick it up a notch and stick it onto your sushi to begin with your pata do a couple things you really need to know I'm using gloves today to kind of make sure that I don't make a big mess in from the camera but we're gonna take a bunch of our rice here about four to five ounce portion of rice and you see it balled up take you from our pot prepared and cooled I'm gonna ball it up so I'm just gonna make sure that I keep Mike working area very clean place it in the center of your pad and now you gonna do what I call the bullet types of them one of the hardest things that beginning sushi people are gonna have to face with is trying to keep everything on your mat from here I'm gonna take the rice split it in half evenly distribute it onto our pack and then I'm gonna form a bow tie using just the tips of my fingers I'm gonna press the rice out to the edge of the nori pattern starting with the outer edges having my little bowtie design and then I'm gonna fix the rest of the perimeter reason you do this is you'll see at the end of your roll that if you take a little attention to detail at this point of your rolling sequence your sushi is going to look excellent when you start chopping it up and serve it to your guests or to yourself you can see in a matter of seconds I've got it even  ball of rice now I'm adding my ball of rice now I'm adding my sushi next you gonna consider is what kind of toppings you'd like to put on to this role as I said it's an inside-out roll so this part of the rice that you're looking at will be the part of the sushi roll it should actually see so whatever you put on to this part of the roll will be presented to your customer your friends or to yourself in this case we're using a five putt spice spice Japanese shurochka sauce combination of Japanese chili spice dried orange rind black and white sesame seeds and some dried seaweed this is the first layer of spicy or spicy tuna right now this is what makes it inside out I'm taking my pad flipping it over be very careful to keep all the ingredients here and you nice and neat and anything I'm gonna place onto this side of it which is now the inside of your roll will we consider what your filling starting off with our scallions Jenna selfie with scallions and then I'm taking a couple of pinches of the spicy tuna - here's ready to make a big mistake one of the cardinal sins of sushi rollers are trying to put too much and do too little bit of a roll as you can see we've cut this roll in half so it's a half pack so anything more than four or five ounces of material inside will give you a roll that will not properly seal and you'll not have a good sushi experience so at this point I've got all the fixings for my spicy tuna roll now here's where the sushi chef skills come to the plate I'm going to take my fingers and again we're not going to be manhandling sushi it's very delicate art is very delicate food you take my thumbs take my fingers I'm gonna gently raise them all up until like Cup and I'm going to decrease the air gap between your fish you need nori pad you press it up against there next I'm gonna do is I'm actually let gravity be my friend I'm not gonna manhandle the sushi as you can see I'm basically with my thumbs picking up whatever bits of rice need to be placed onto those nori pad with my fingers my pinkies and all my fingers I'm gently tucking in the roll and as I tuck and press tuck and press with my thumbs and my fingers I'm letting gravity do all the work and the roll will fall on itself now the piece of equipment that most people consider critical to sushi rolling through bamboo mat can come into play for cleanliness and for ease of use I wrapped it in saran wrap you'll take your mat place it over your roll and at this point one of the nuances of the sushi roll that come into play we're gonna form the roll and not press it down I'll give a gentle a bit of pressure to seal that bottom half of the room again gravity covered the roll my mats gonna form it I'm gonna give a little bit pressure and then I'm gonna use the mat and my chopping board depress form roll press form roll and after three rolls I'm staring at the scene or bottom half of my sexual and if I've done a good job we can have our sushi roll has been sealed we flip it over to this top side and again you can see where the presentation of the roll from the beginning of the attention to detail spreading on my spicy sauce spicy powder comes into play the next step santoku style knife for you not the sushi rollers people ask me you know what kind of knife should I get this is 995 from Hawaii but if you keep your blade sharp maintain your knife and use a proper as far as cutting techniques you can use any knife in your kitchen what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring into our water bin to play and you're gonna want to keep a bit of water right next to you just for multiple purposes to watch your knife to clean your hands and right next our water bin you can want to have a wet pack reason being is cleanliness is next to godliness and sushi rolling and I'm constantly dabbing the tips of my fingers and any piece of my body that comes in contact with the sushi roll so I'm dipping my knife into the water and this is a quick little tip a nice little trick keep your pad by the water and watch it dream now if you look closely at the knife come heel to toe on the blade it's coated with water so when I come to my sushi roll I should have a clean cut my knife is sharp I've maintained it and there isn't a lot of material on here I should have a clean cut going through the road you can find the center of my roll I'm gonna do two cuts I'm getting an initial cut they'll take me in about half an inch into my roll and then a second cut that should get me to the base of the roll at which point my knife put it in water watch a journey find the centerpiece of my second half when I first excuse me one cut two cuts like my night repeat one cut - cut Michael's on board spicy tuna ready for presentation you
