 hi everyone and welcome back to chef C's today we're going to be making everyone's favorite a margherita pizza homemade piece is so fun and exciting to make and after you've mastered the basics you can do whatever you want and add anything on it and just like always only thing we need are a few simple ingredients so let's get started now the first step we're going to have to do is rolling out our dough and what that we need to generously flour out our workspace area this is going to help prevent a dough from sticking when we're rolling it out and so now that we have a generous amount of flour on the bottom we're also going to have to add flour to the top there we go just like that just simply press with our fingertips working our way from the inside out and nice circular motion I'm just trying to create a nice base circle at the moment and flip it over and doing the same a nice little trick of what I found that helps me a lot whenever I'm rolling out my dough is this little wine bottle actually yeah use it for drinking use it for working there you go so you see how I just roll it back and forth spin it around little house circles and when you get one side moving and coming alive we can just flip it over see a nice nice gentle circle make sure we add a little bit more flour to the bottom of the cutting board yeah it's going to help prevent it from sticking a little bit more on top as well spread it across and right now I'm just going to try to stretch it by hand and just try to balance out there's some thicker parts and thinner parts of the dough you just sort of massage it through different spots it's good to be gentle with it but you also want to take control and let the dough know where it needs to move yeah yeah finish it up just like that now what I like to do is sprinkle the pizza tray with a bit of semolina what this semolina flour is going to do is just going to help the ASET go to slide on and off very very easily you see that now it's time to add the sauce simply just grab a ladle and starting from the middle work can't sway from inside out working in a circular motion you could add as much or as little sauce as you like I like my pizza nice and moist so am I going to add a little bit more than some people might see those chunks right there that's a garlic confit it's going to be so yummy and tasty just explosions of garlic now let's add our mozzarella cheese so simply just place it on the outside break in a nice circle nice little ring around it and working its way around you see I'm a native New Yorker so of course I like a lot of cheese on mine but if you like you could hold back on a bit of cheese and it's totally fine remember this is your pizza that you're going to be making at home so add as much in as little as you like to whichever you want there we are now just remember make sure we add a little bit of seasoning as well little bit of salt always everything needs to get seasoned and a few cracks of fresh cracked black pepper now the star ingredient to finish this margarita pizza off it's going to be our basil the red green and white symbolizes Italian flag so make sure that every bite gets a little bit of everything there we go basil also adds a really nice refreshing flavor to whatever you're eating and when it roasts in this oven right here it's going to add a really whole nother complete different textural flavor you're really going to enjoy it I believe and let's just add one more for good measure right in the middle where mmm there we go perfect and there she is good old beautiful margarita pizza let's get ready to put her in the oven so in a 475 degree oven I'm just going to put this in my pizza stone and the semolina is really helping this come off very smoothly place that in there we are put it in let it hang out for about eight minutes should be perfect some ovens are different but check yours about eight minutes and check this out oh yeah here that this has got a really nice crust to the bottom of it as well look at this gooeyness yes that's the New Yorker in me with the cheese pizza check out this beautiful crust right here nice alright let's dig in so quite simply cut it in quarters spin around one more chop and this is just way too tempting I'm gonna have to bite into this okay I really taste all this piping hot whew mmm I took your crust hold this texture soft it's got a good little bite to it yeah this is this works ladies and gentlemen it's official it's a good pizza yes going to have to go back for some more well there we have it our margarita homemade pizza great for friends great for the family and here's a recipe as following I really hope you enjoyed this video and making this pizza as well so give me some feedback in let me know how it turned out thanks for watching please like and subscribe
