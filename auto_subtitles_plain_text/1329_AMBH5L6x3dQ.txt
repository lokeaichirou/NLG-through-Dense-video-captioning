 welcome to Malaysia kitchen Australia I'm MK reporter and I'm here with our ambassador Alvin POIs welcome Alvin good to see you again now tell me what are we cooking today we're making a seafood lobster so from scratch yeah that's like really hard work no this is this is really easy all my stuff all my recipes are really easy it's all about getting the right balance the right ingredients and you're ready to go in well Aussies love our seafood so I'm really looking forward to this a seafood lapsim I won't get anyway great guy let's do it so we're going to start making my lot so today is a seafood lover let's start making the paste from scratch so we've got some garlic and ginger so all it goes into the food process and we've got some candlenuts here now that's been soaking in water for a bit just to soften in a little bit now can all not serve really good for Luxor's they give it that creaminess into it like we can't find kettle nuts try harder but if you really can't find kettle nuts that you can use macadamias as well so nice and Australian so we can actually add some we're going to add some chopped onions so this is just roughly chopped so they're all just going to go in there some small birds are chilly so these are I'm leaving the seeds on because we like spicy food so we're gonna check going we've got some dried shrimp as well now dried shrimp again seafood luxord lots of paste itself is actually very it's just an intense seafood paste so we're going to add the dried shrimp we're going to add some turmeric powder so this gives you that color about a teaspoon we're going to add some lime rind this gives it that lovely sort of fresh citrusy flavor now Vietnamese mint so we got we need a like a good bunch about a tablespoon now we've got it at the shrimp paste now we only go to add 1 teaspoon so we're not going to add the whole block now this if you want to you can actually toast them fairly gently on the flame so that gives it that extra sort of toastiness but you don't have to we've also got some coriander powder also a teaspoon we're going to add in I think that's all so we're going to put a little bit of oil to lubricate it and then we're going to grind it all together and that's going to be our pace we can start making the Lancer so just about a tablespoon now I'm going to start whizzing now we're just going to tip this prawn heads in there so it smells nice instead of pointing now you can see it slowly changes color to this nice sort of orangey sort of gold sort of prawn oil and that's what you want so there'll be a lot of splattering so your kid try this at home do down the adult supervision so that's well done with hair now and this is a great way if you don't eat the heads this is a great way to actually use it you know like I saw we're talking about sustainable eating these days and we want to use the Beast you know from head to toe so why not use the prawn heads as well so at the pace now that's smelling really good if you need to add a little bit more oil but this is fine for me and once you get that lovely sort of fragrance you can actually start adding your stop now the stop that I'm actually using it's actually a combination of chicken stock and fish stock I love this stuff it actually gives it again it's a seafood luxr so go with if it's a chicken like so then use old chicken stock but it's a combination so it's a total of one liter so I'm going to add them in so once it starts to come to boil you can actually add the coconut cream so we'll do that now this variations of lotsa so that's like the the health-conscious latter which everyone uses you know light cream you know like the 70% less fat yeah like I I love like what's the point of having lotsa when it's going to be fat-free you're not going to eat this every day unless you're in Malaysia trust me we eat this for breakfast so we're going to bring that to boil as well and then once that comes to boil we'll start adding all the other ingredients so the prawns the fish balls the tofu paths but now is when the balancing sort of starts so you want to taste it now if you taste it right now it's going to be fairly it's going to be fairly creamy and it's going to be fairly you know kind of raw so it's not ready yet so this is when you start adding little bits and pieces so you add by splashing a couple of drops of fish sauce when a couple I mean you know about a minute of splashing so we can add a bit of sugar to flavor that and then we're going to squeeze some lime juice in just be sitting there so the idea is you want to find a balance so when you're actually flavoring you kind of need to sort of go okay that needs a bit more fish sauce so that needs a bit more salt now then we're going to add the prawns in righto so once that's in we're going to add the balls fish balls and the tofu puffs as well so we're ready to play it up that's sort of nice and percolating away so we've got our lovely bowl of vermicelli here we're going to top it with a little bit of bean sprouts and then we're going to start scooping all these lovely look at that so we want to start with maybe some tofu puffs we'll just put it there so have some fish balls as well a couple of prawns and then we're going to spoon the soup over that now then we're going to top it with a little bit of coriander and it's lots if you do want for bit more contrast we can add a bit all sprouts so there you go how easy is that seafood lotsa alvin style mmm i followed my nose and look what i found always ready for the taste where's mine
