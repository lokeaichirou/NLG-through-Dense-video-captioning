 [Music] hello I'm sue McMahon and I'm cookware de chairwoman's weekly magazine and I'm going to show you how to make shepherd's pie [Music] the first thing to do for the shepherd's pie is to prepare the bass so I've got a tablespoon of light olive oil in the pan and I'm warming it up and once I can feel it's hot I'm going to add to the pan two onions that I've peeled and chopped and I'm also going to work to Paris that are games peels and chops [Music] and I'm going to leave this cook on a medium heat for about five to seven minutes until the vegetables have softened a little bit so once the vegetables are softened I'm going to add to the pan 500 grams of minced lamb and then I break this down with the spatulas so that it will cook evenly traditional shepherd's pie was made using cooked lamb and it was a way of using up the meat after a Sunday roast dinner so if you want to you could use cook lamb chop finely or mince in this recipe but if you use cooked lamb just cook it for a little bit less than I'm doing though so what's the need to throw a little the surfaces and going thread around your tablespoon of plain flour and that will pick them up the juices that have come out of the land and then I'm also going to add two tablespoons of tomato puree which will give it a nice color and about once two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and the saltiness in this helps to enhance the flavor at the Shepherd I and I also have 200 milliliters of lamb stock if you want to you could add a dash of red wine to this which helps to give a nice flavor to it and I'm also going to add about a tablespoon of chopped thyme so I'm now going to leave this the simmer for about five minutes so once I've simmered the lamb I'm now going to season it and I like quite a lot of freshly ground black pepper but I'm going to add just a little bit of salt because the Worcestershire sauce is quite salty so I don't want to make the recipe over salty so I'm going to mix that in and then I'm going to spoon this into an ovenproof dish now for the topping for this I've got some mashed potato about a kilo of mashed potato but when I'm doing this at home I tend to use what other vegetables I have I think it's really nice my favorite is a mixture of half potato and half past nip sometimes I do it with some carrot in it as well so it makes it an orange-colored mash so any root vegetables even celeriac with the potato makes a nice mesh so I'm going to spoon this on top and I'm just spreading it out so it's totally covering the mince land I'm just texturing the top very slightly and I've got it on a baking tray because if any of the mixture boils out of the dish when it's in the oven it will fall onto the baking tray rather than dirtying the bottom of the oven now this needs to be baked at 180 degrees centigrade which is guess mark 4 and it takes about 30 to 40 minutes or it's ready when the top is nice and golden and you can see the filling beginning to bubble up from around the edges of the potato so when the pie is ready it should be nice and golden on the top this one has bubbled out a bit so it's a good job that I put it on the baking tray and that's all ready for serving so if I scoop them out onto a plate my favorite with this is baked beans I actually like them cold with it but it's also good to serve it with a salad so that's finished shepherd's pie [Music] you [Music]
