 if you're looking for some healthy game day snack inspirations than I've got you covered I hope he watched our previous video where I showed you how to make pub style sliders it was a collaboration between us and Lee from six kids productions so if you haven't checked it out already make sure you do so we'll leave a link for you so that's why I wanted to make today my pita chips with roasted red pepper hummus this recipe was in high demand when I was a caterer and today I'm gonna share my secrets with you so grab your pita bread and I'll show you how to make this these chips and dip are so easy to make that you'll be wondering why you haven't been making them already and all you need for them is pita bread olive oil salt pepper lemon red bell pepper chickpeas tahini hot sauce and garlic before you start this recipe at all you're gonna need 1 red bell pepper and put it over a gas flame and then all you do is just let it sit there for a few minutes until the skins blacken and blister when it does then you use your tongs to flip it over to the other side and you keep doing this until all sides of the pepper including the top and the bottom are nicely blistered and blackened and if you don't have a gas stove you can always do this under the broiler in the oven so just put on this sheet pan and do it that way too once it's blackened you put it into a bowl cover it with saran wrap and let it seem so the skin can be sand away from the flesh after a few minutes just use your fingers to wipe away all of the blackened parts and that's the skin that's just charred away then you can easily remove the stems and the seeds and what you're left with is this nice soft and sweet flesh so easy but if you don't want to roast your own pepper I will be mad at you if you do buy it from the jar ok so let's get going now I have two cloves of coarsely chopped garlic I'm gonna add in your roasted red bell pepper this should help your garlic a lot work with a spatula nearby so you can help yourself out now you have one 15 and a half ounce can of drained and rinsed chickpeas do you guys say chickpeas or garbanzo beans let me know in the comments this is the most important ingredient for hummus tahini okay and tahini is just a sesame paste three tablespoons okay three tablespoons of lemon juice four to five dashes of hot sauce depending on how you like it the heat and then you're gonna start off with half a teaspoon of kosher salt and if you want it a little bit more seasoned then add at the end but this is a good start some pepper and I have one to two tablespoons of water so if I need it I'm gonna add it you know I think I like my hummus a little chunky if you didn't add the roasted red bell pepper you might need it because it'll be too thick but the bell pepper kind of adds a little liquid on its own so I'm gonna leave it out all right come on guys that was super easy right and just to make things a little bit prettier for presentation I'm just gonna do a little scoop IDI scoops and then drizzle with some olive oil perfect set this aside you can even make this a day in advance and keep it in your fridge so this is why it's perfect for game day because it's like a make-ahead dip let's move on to the pita chips okay so now this is just for two so I'm only going to use two pieces of pita bread and this will make about 16 little pita points or triangles so cut your bread into quarters and then cut each quarter in half and trust me these are thick chips so that a little goes a long way and then I just placed them on a tray can you imagine how many of these I had to make when I was catering that was no joke now I will admit in my catering days I did split the pitas in half see how they opened up like a beak I did split them in half if they were thinner and you can do that too if you're kind of like bread conscious you can just make them thinner and then cook them for less time now all you need is olive oil salt and pepper if you want to be more fancy go ahead add garlic powder I've done it with garlic powder and crushed oregano dried oregano you can also add spices on top such as cumin and chili so really go nuts and then you just sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper flip them over and repeat make sure you give them a good even brushing because you want them to crisp up nicely for you these taste best on the same day that they're made sometimes you have luck with having them good the next day too depending on how Chris you made the pitas the oven is set to 375 degrees and you're just gonna pop these into the oven for about 10 minutes but just watch it and you know according to your ovens temperature too so after 5 minutes you're just gonna rotate the chips if they get crisp on the other side as well too once they're golden brown and crispy to the touch then you know they're good you don't want them really to be chewy in the middle because they have a tendency to do that too so just watch it make sure they're nice and dry are you ready to chip and dip yes ma'am nice consistency the exact same thing so crispy and crunchy with the hint at that olive oil Bahamas is so creamy and smooth it is you can taste that hint of garlic and a hint of sweetness from the roasted red pepper and if you don't want to just munch on pita chips all day and then you can pair it with some fresh veggies it goes great with celery why don't you give it a try and there really goes well together nicely refreshing crunch this is just great cinnamon and TV enjoy the game kind of snack for the pre game coverage three-hour coverage for substitutions obviously you can eat veggies instead of pita chips and for the hummus if you don't want to use roasted red pepper whether it's from a jar or roasting it yourself you can also give it a twist by adding in some marinated artichokes for a little bit of a tangy zing you can also use pesto for a little brightness of herbaceous flavor and you could always just eat a
