 welcome back once again to how to cook great food calm only mania today some mutton curry I've got some lovely chunky mutton here I must beat up only in it and everything is this is it works wonders like this get the juice out of that okay I've had he ever touch up while I'm using the corn oil now the first thing I do is I want to drop me in our lamb mutton without any spices as the spices I just want to cook this for about three or four minutes if you want to put a lid on that and ground it up a bit okay so I'll turn the heat down because if you get quite lively in here a long time to cook you've got a pressure cooker it's probably the best way that's gonna take a long time to cook this 1/2 cup baby I've got my drive hog alamos are not gonna building but cumin seeds mustard seeds cardamom coconut coriander seeds close release their oils will eat the seeds that will reduce that world already now I'm training with but you can't get these a great I've got fresh curry leaves the absolutely wonderful mentor huge difference now somehow this what I call the big four equal parts coriander cumin turmeric or how deep and chili powder so let's just get that all happening in there now and what's the guy named with some fresh chili green chilli add as much or little as you wish here I put some garlic ginger place which is 50/50 it's garlic and ginger mix together finely finely chopped now some chopped onion I'm using the red onion I prefer them really that's slightly stronger okay we can turn the heat up on this now so what we want to do is we just want to give this a little mix on our high heat make sure all that masala whether it be the fresh leaves the powders or the seeds coats out means that garlic and ginger and the work wonders in there as well what the lid seemed to go back on I'm gonna turn the heat down slightly I'm gonna cook this for about ten minutes okay let's take a look I've said this a couple of times already now we're at the point now where we cook it any longer we're gonna start to burn these onions and so but we are way off finish so sound a little bit of water so that the moves are too early otherwise your powders and spices wouldn't have done their job and they'll taste really dry let's just give it a nice bit of moisture their lids gonna go back on the heat spell elope see you in ten okay let's jump in now take a look fifteen fantastic that will describe be reducing now I'm going to go in with some chopped tomatoes these are little mix around now if you've got a pressure cooker and you're going to save lots of time with this I mean pressure Coons are just really great with anything chunky like this and the poem it all really kind of tenderize it quite quickly so you've got one of those you're gonna save a whole lot of time I'm just showing you this way today because a lot of you don't have it I've got a few emails normally I would do this in cooker okay now I'm gonna do is get the lid back on the heat is fairly low I'm gonna cook this for about ten minutes we want those tomatoes to completely break down and create our masala we might have a little touch more water but let's see see you in a while okay let's have a look there you go as you can see that tomatoes have broken down really nicely we are going to need a little bit more liquid in that got some cold water here now you can't really overcook this dish you want this meat to be incredibly tender I'm gonna throw in some fresh coriander now which adds a beautiful flavor give that a stir check your one for salt now your money dragon touch more salt I'm not a great salt fan now as I say you could cook this with number 10 minutes or another hour it depends on your meat so you need to keep checking your meat let's lovely and tender you want that kind of meat to fall off the bone really so depending on your meat is how long you're gonna cook this dish for now turning that heat really low now really really low my lids gonna go back on I think mine's gonna be 15 minutes hope you enjoy we'll see you again soon bye
