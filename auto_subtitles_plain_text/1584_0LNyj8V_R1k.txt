 welcome back once again to house for the food commie if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel ok on the menu today we're gonna make a fantastic lamb bhuna really lovely curry this let me just run through some ingredients we're start with a starless show here's our lamb there's no bone in this one you can make it with bone I'm making this without bone it's nice and lean little bit of fat on it which is good plenty of chopped onions nice and small do you want to get this nice and smooth I've got some mustard seed oil there ok on the side the upper I'll go back two or three medium size tomatoes I put in my blender and whisk them up to a nice fresh pureed here I've put about a hundred grams of fresh yogurt we're gonna have that later flipping over to this side I've got some fresh coriander again beautiful right at the end here I've got some garlic and ginger place by any means and in the sense I've got a few spices happiness just run through them so here are my whole garam masala chopped up baby cloves cinnamon green cardamom and red chilli next to that you see how good garam masala which we add at the end that goes in at the beginning that goes in right at the end and then in between here I've got some sort I've got chili powder cumin powder and coriander powder about the same amount this week now if you want you could use just your favorite curry powder I don't think it's quite the same so if you can go this this way this version is much much better it's gonna taste really morph though really not authentic we need to get over to this cook up start cooking our lovely onions and lamb first of all let's go okay so as you can see I've got my pan on it's on a fairly high heat I've got my mustard oil in mustard oil it's quite central to this you don't have it just use a number well but it is good let's start by getting in our whole garam masala those bay leaves that cinnamon cardamon a little bit of chilli and those close simply just get these at like 30 seconds not not even that sometimes depending on what what different types of dermis onion or just want to do is get back oil heat it through these and they're gonna release loads of aromas of their own their natural goodness in oil which is a nice base start slightly pop and crackle and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in now I just gonna save with my onions onions finish I mean wow it's just it's not instant but nice taste so just like that I'm gonna cook this you're totally gonna take seven eight minutes keep stirring it I'll be back then [Music] so you can see how and I hold garam masalas really good government smell coming out it is fantastic now let's get our planning on the cell goes on my stripped allow me a nice and lean a little bit fast that you can see on it it's fantastic that take that off your kind of neat that really little bit of that's always good and again what we're gonna do here this is kind of what makes a boon up you know kind of be fairly joy but trying this beat with these onions the big parts of this dish so we're gonna just do what I'm doing right now stirring this around again I want to kind of fairly high heat we're gonna cook this just like this for about six or seven minutes I see them nicely nothing fried looking great now I'm gonna add in our garlic ginger paste 50-50 mix that is and tomatoes purified fresh tomatoes makes a massive difference so any bug is that pakka stuff it's not so good good mix today I monster in there now I'm gonna pull the lid off lower the heat that needs to least 15 to 20 minutes see you then should we take a look steamed out so it doesn't cover the lens for you nice-looking Manchester to me okay now it's time for some spices out whole spices we've got coriander this salt there's 2 min and there's chilli powder about equal amounts like I said then I could stir show me absolutely delicious this dish honestly really really nice it's gonna be okay our fresh coriander just a little bit of it now I'm gonna add some more later touch now touch later stir that in now I'm gonna cook this off now about another six seven minutes gonna raise the heat a little bit not to a rage just up a little bit medium heat now wanna dry this out a little bit keeping the lid on obviously keeps a lot of the moisture inside we've done that to kind of break down our tomatoes and get them to this stage you now want to kind of dry this out a little bit lid off stir it every now and then see in a moment okay look at that nice and dry now or certainly drier that it was now why this whole process is going our lamb is getting really tender need to cook your lamb bones or beef if you're going to use beef example quite a long time to get it really nice to succulent okay now we're gonna add our yogurt to that playing straight natural yogurt or curd let's call this some places in the world I'm gonna give that a good mix in then we're gonna add the lid we've got a very loving each now again about ten minutes this time then it will come together let that y'all got really working there and apart from a couple of other little bits to do this will be done so lead on lower the heat see you in ten minutes okay the final stage I've just turned the heat off now I'm gonna now add a little bit more of our fresh coriander just to finish it off and then if you remember that one did not be love garam masala powder you know finishing powder there I'll sprinkle on give this a mix check it for salt I've checked mine it's fine this is gonna be great with some roti rice chapati anything you like just delicious a really nice rich sauce there that meat is incredibly tender hope you enjoy it see you again next time bye bye
