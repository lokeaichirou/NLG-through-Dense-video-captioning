 I'm a big fan of eating hummus as a snack at home and I would say that I'm about equally divided between buying hummus and making it myself I personally like the stuff I make better and my kids I took a little embarrassing to say this but I think they like the store-bought better anyway I think it's better to make it yourself and you're definitely going to save some money if you do it so why not give it a try the first thing you want to do is chop your garlic turn the processor on and then drop the cloves through the feed tube it works so much better than if you put them in and then turn the machine on I'm not sure about the scientific reason for that but it definitely does it gets nice and finely ground you don't have to top it yourself and then to that you're going to add the rest of your ingredients it's two cans of chickpeas that have been drained you can definitely cook your own by soaking them overnight and then simmering them in water to cover it can take one to three hours depending on the age a quarter cup of the liquid from the can or the cooking liquid if you made your own about an eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper a little more a little less it's up to you and then some lemon juice you can use up to a third of a cup depending on how acidic you like it I'm going to start with a few tablespoons and a quarter cup of tahini this is a ground sesame paste and sometimes you'll find when you buy it that it's separated and there's a bunch of oil on the top you want to make sure to stir it really well sometimes I take it out of the container and puree it in a food processor and then put it back in and then some salt and then went or process that's it it's so easy why would you not make it at home oh you know the other thing I wanted to tell you guys you want to add a little bit of extra flavor to your homemade hummus how about chopping up some capers and adding it or black olives or even some roasted pepper start it with your favourite accompaniments I don't care what my kids there I think it's much better than the store-bought and you're going to think so to make this I demand it it's so easy so much more economical I'm so much more delicious do it hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this
