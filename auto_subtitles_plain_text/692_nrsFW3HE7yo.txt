 okay one of the things that need to kind of make early in the process is I need to make a chili oil it's pretty simple I'm going to take and put this burner on low and here I have a quarter cup of oil I'm using peanut oil I've got 20 red chili peppers and all I'm doing and I'm just cutting them in half I want to be able to see them you could cut them in smaller pieces but they're going to flavor the oil and spice up the oil pretty easy process like I say we're going to have this on low we're just going to cook these for a little bit okay our oil has been cooking for about ten minutes now just occasionally stir in the peppers I'm going to call it good I'm just going to set this aside and let it wait for us till we're ready for it okay so let's do a rundown on some of our other ingredients in here in the mortar and pestle I took two tablespoons of Szechuan peppercorn sometimes those are also called prickly ash and I ground them up now it takes a little bit of work so you may want to do it in a coffee grinder anyway I have here some spicy bean paste you want to make sure you get something that has the bean paste in it because this also adds salt to the dish without that if you just use the spicy stuff you would have to use some soy sauce or something to bring salt to the dish we're not going to be using the soy sauce today I've got a quarter cup of green onion that I've diced up or chopped up four ounces of ground pork two tablespoons of ginger that's been roughly chopped and two tablespoons of garlic that's been roughly chopped okay so here I have a block of silken tofu I'm just going to kind of roughly chop this up you want it nice big pieces because some of the corners and stuff are are going to come across or fall off of it all right I did forget to mention that I made a cornstarch slurry I have one teaspoon of cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of chicken stock and I also have 3/4 cup of chicken stock now in my pan here it's warming up on the burner we're not going to be screamin hot I'm going to put about 3 tablespoons of oil yeah well in this dish but it is good so we're going to look past that all right so my oil is getting warm it's not hot that's fine I'm going to do we're going to put our garlic and our ginger in here then we're going to start putting some of this Szechuan peppercorn in here we'll put about 2/3 of this in here there we go if I don't work set that aside use some of that for garnish leader now what we're going to do we're just going to slowly cook this until everything's cooked we're toasting the peppercorns we're cooking the garlic and ginger down just a little bit don't worry other stuffs coming pretty soon all right so we're about three minutes in my garlic and ginger is starting to soften up a little bit so we're going to turn this heat up a little bit we're still not going crank it up yet we're not at that point yet because we're not really stir frying this dish okay now it's time for pork I'm just going to break this up all right so our pork is basically cooked it's not crisping up or anything like that yet but it's cooked all the way through we broke it up and the garlic and ginger is really doing good now we're going to put our spicy bean paste in here and you're about to see some magic starting now that stuff is salty so if you don't like real salty you might want to use just a little bit of it and then use a some just plain spicy chili paste I got it's going to give this we're going to go ahead and turn the heat up a little bit more give this a couple minutes okay now if you don't want it so salty you can use some of this it'll help you with spice and everything and it's not so salty now this is basically ready for our chicken stock inject it heat up a little bit now we've got our corn starch and chicken stock we're going to put this in and we're going to cook this for a little bit all right so this is just starting to thicken up we're going to go ahead and we're going to put our chili oil in here as if it didn't have enough oil all right this is really bubbling away we're going to go ahead we're going to put our gently put our tofu in here now remember this is silken tofu it'll break apart real easy we want a little bit to break apart that is what does the final thickening on the sauce but we still want some big pieces in there generous now we're going to gently stir this around make sure all sides of this tofu absorbs all these good flavors and we've worked to put in here I'm going to give this about another minute and we'll put our green onions in there all right we're going to take all most of these green onions and put them in there I'm going to leave a little bit for garnishing okay I'm going to take and put some of this in our Bowl here make sure we show some peppers on here I'm going to put some green onion does some of this Szechuan peppercorn on there and that is dinner
