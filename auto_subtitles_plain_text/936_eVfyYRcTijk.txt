it's great to have make much captain thank you very much I caught some beautiful Cod in Casco Bay with Captain Jim and his first mate Andy and I'm really excited to batter this guy up first I'm going to start on my tartar sauce because what sufficient chips without tartar sauce so the basin of tartar sauce is really just this mayonnaise she's going to bind all the ingredients together here I've subtract Cornish sean's has a nice briny flavor capers some shallots I'm gonna add some parsley that's good to see rough chop right into the bowl now I'm gonna grab some tarragon and this is going to bring this licorice flavor you're not going to find tarragon in your traditional tartar sauce but I just really enjoy it now I'm going to add a squeeze of the lemon just a tiny bit of salt and some black pepper that looks good it's going to go perfect with my fish set this guy side and now I'm going to start on my chips let's grab a few potatoes all right so this is a Japanese mandolin it really it's just a set blade so you're just going to slide the potato back and forth really consistent motion it's a really essential tool to getting these really thin consistent slices you know you're not putting too much pressure on this you want the blade to do all the work you can get pretty close but I like to keep it safe just throw away this stubby or you can use it in a stock or a soup but I don't want to risk my fingers start a new potato that should be good right there now I'm going to soak them in water just to get rid of some of that starch so they don't stick together as they fry so I put this paper towel down because I want to blot some of the excess water off these chips because you never want to add water to a hot pot of oil all right now I'm going to start frying my potato chips but before that I want to check the temperature I have this handy dandy infrared thermometer about 350 is good it's good to keep these potato chips moving around you don't want any hot spots in your oil and you'll start to tell when they're done because they'll get a really nice golden-brown gonna strain this and blot it off on a paper towel get rid of any excess oil just pull these last ones out now I'm going to chop up some herbs and toss it in with the potato chips it's just going to give it a nice aroma some tomato parsley all right some pic time this is just going to give a little color to the potatoes nice aromatic or base flavor toss these herbs in there add a little bit of salt give it a quick toss and some cracked black pepper all right these are done now I'm going to move on to my batter for the fish we're going to my stell out pop this guy open I'm going to crack an egg just going to help bind the whole batter just a little bit of Stella we're going to start with just a small amount of liquid and the carbonation is really just going to lighten the batter yielding a really crispy fish whisk that up I'm going to add a little bit of flour at a time make sure it doesn't clump up so you want to add this in small portions just keep repeating this process really this is just going to be very reminiscent of a pancake batter you want this just to coat the back of a spoon I'm just going to put a little bit of salt in here and that is looking good now I'm going to get onto the fish we caught some of these guys out in Casco Bay nice and fresh probably quarter this and just nice strips like that I'm going to cut this other guy right in half is to just go straight into the batter so these are just lightly coated so the important thing when frying this fish is that the temperature of the oil has to be just right because you want the batter cooked and nice and golden-brown but you also want the fish cooked all the way through these will take about five to seven minutes but really you're going to know that they've done when the outside just gets nice and golden brown all right these look just absolutely fantastic put these over here blot any excess oil off you don't want them to be too greasy a little bit of salt right when they come out and I'm going to plate this just a handful of these seasoned chips there you go nice stack these a good serving size and of course my tartar sauce now this go right in the basket now I'm gonna have a taste mmm fish is cooked perfectly and the batter is just really nice thin and crispy I taste one of these chips too it's great fried foods are really salty and fatty so it's nice to have the cedrus Crisp apple notes to balance it all out thank you so much for watching hopefully enjoyed my take on this classic dish join me next week as I head down to Hampton New Hampshire to check out their seafood festival
