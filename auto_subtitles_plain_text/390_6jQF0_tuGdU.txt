 I've been heating my pan over medium-high heat I'm going to add some oil olive oil couple tablespoons put that in there I'm going to add a medium sized onion got 1 cup of onion little bit all cook them about five minutes maybe four minutes they're starting to get a little brown on the edges that's what I want so I'm going to add a garlic one clove of garlic and add a tablespoon of tomato paste stir that in I'm going to cook this about a minute and next I'm going to add sugar just a teaspoon of sugar and some red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons of vinegar and water 3/4 cup water I'm going to let this simmer together and - a dish of hot sauce maybe about a teaspoon of hot sauce in there - we'll let this cook down and come and get thick so when you're cooking this I turn the heat down to medium-low just to go slowly we want to drag your spoon across and make sure there's no like excess water and it's pretty much done and ready next take your hot dog and put some sauerkraut on there just like that some of the sauce that we made and some spicy mustard there you go let's give it a try delicious New York hotdog thanks for watching
