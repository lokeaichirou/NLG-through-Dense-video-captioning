 today we're going to be making creamy cheesy mac and cheese you're watching these are the ingredients that we're gonna need to make the mac and cheese this is a 16 ounce pack of elbow macaroni the small ones but we're only going to use half the pack for this recipe okay this is two and a half tablespoons of all-purpose flour eight ounces of processed cheese that brand happens to be Velveeta but you could use any brand you like this is a quarter cup of butter and three cups of whole milk but you could use 2% 1% or nonfat this macaroni and cheese is gonna be cooked on the stovetop and in the oven so let's move over to the stove we're already have the water boiling for us to add the noodles so it took about 10 11 minutes to bring this water to a boil and it's my big pot that I'm using here and I put half of it with water and I brought it to a boil if you wanted to come to a boil more quickly you should add some salt to the water I know that because we did that in a science project once and when the kids were little but I didn't add any salt because you know the cheese has salt and we're gonna add some salt to the cheese sauce so I didn't add any salt to this water and I'm just gonna measure out half of this pack of the elbow macaroni and we're gonna stand here and watch this because you only want this to cook for about five to six minutes because we want it to be all denting while that's cooking though I'm going to move to the left hand side of the stove and we're gonna get the cheese sauce started so I have a smaller pot over here and I put the fire on just now on high and I'm gonna take my quarter cup of butter put it in the pot so that it can melt and I'll tell you at what point if we have to put the fire on medium okay so we're just gonna allow this to melt in here so doesn't even take a minute we want to just kind of add the flour to it you're gonna mix this around and yes this is a roux my fire is too high so I'm gonna turn it to medium I don't want this to get lumpy so we're just gonna work this in there because right now we're gonna go ahead and add the milk after this is worked in really well we're gonna add the milk and remember that's three cups of milk get the measurement precise on this one okay because it's gonna need to cook in the oven for a while and we want this to come out the right texture so we just added the milk I'm gonna let this cook for about two minutes at which point I'm gonna add the cheese and then I'm gonna tell you how much longer it has to cook okay in the meanwhile it's been about three minutes since I started the noodles over there see they're really boiling and after I put them in like you know kind of use my um spaghetti server thing here I used that to just kind of move the noodles around in the pot because I don't want them to clump together I mean when I first started cooking noodles was the one that kind of mastered me I really couldn't do noodles they were always sticky and uncooked and too soft or too hard or I just couldn't get it right so and I still don't think I'm a master at it but I surely know how to time it so this is about three minutes that this been cooking and like I said we don't want it to go too long cause it's gonna bake for a half-hour in the oven okay so it's gonna be doing some more cooking so let's move back over here to my cheese sauce and the fire is too low now so I'm gonna move it back from medium to high I just kind of turn it down just knowing I didn't want to route a burn so I turn it to high cuz we want this to start really boiling here and then we're gonna add the cheese in a little bit so let me give it a couple more minutes alright it took about three minutes for our milk mixture here to start boiling so now what we want to do is add the cheese in and oh by the way I diced the cheese okay because I don't want to put it in that big block because it won't melt easily you could put it in that big block so let me turn this down back to medium because we don't want the cheese to scorch but in the meanwhile I want to be back over to the noodle pot to show you that the noodles are pretty much done so I just want to show you that these noodles are done when I picked it up like that and I kind of pinched it in my finger they're not too soft but they're not hard either like uncooked so it took about ten minutes actually after the water was bunny and I put it in it took ten minutes to get it to the point I want to stop it right away because I don't want it to overcook and I'm gonna take it over to the sink and pour it in a colander all right so most science to this right just pouring it in there and people are usually saying you want to pour some cold water on that to make it stop cooking and all that stuff we don't need to do all that for this mac and cheese because basically we're just finishing up the cheese sauce and we're gonna add this to our baking pan right so just leave it there in the sink for a minute warn people in your house so they don't we'll throw your there dirty plates in there right I always have to warn somebody hey I've got something in the sink let's move back over to the stove and check on our cheese sauce so here's the cheese sauce you kind of want to keep this on low so it doesn't get lumps or and doesn't burn okay but it looks like our cheese has melted pretty much in this so I'm gonna go ahead and shut this off this took a total of about seven minutes to cook like this so now let's move this over to the counter so we can add it to the macaroni and to the baking dish okay so I have this 9 by 13 by 2 pan and all I'm doing is putting our cooked elbow macaroni in there I didn't butter the dish or anything it's not gonna stick because this is one of those nonstick things so just gonna spread it out and then we want to get our cheese sauce while everything is still warm and we're gonna go ahead and pour the cheese sauce over this and then we're gonna get it to the oven okay and I've already preheated the oven on 350 degrees we're gonna bake this for only a half hour I'm sure I get everything I want to get anything that's burned on the bottom can you put that away I'm just gonna mix it around well I'm not gonna put any kind of breadcrumbs on the top because I've tried it like that we don't like it that's my oven telling me it's ready okay we don't like it like that so I'm just gonna go ahead and bake it this way and it's gonna form a little crust over it that's gonna be awesome enough without the bread crumbs need backup off of that so you can see the dish so there we go half hour in the oven and when I come back I'm gonna be showing you the finished product and here's our finished product off the mac and cheese it took a half-hour in the oven and it's a nice coating on the top right there I'm waiting for it to cool down for a little bit then I'm gonna cut out the first slice and show you guys how it looks okay here's that first slice well of course you know that mac and cheese is not believing right but that's why I didn't name this show the Belize show or the Caribbean show I named it the bear practice show very few ingredients wonderful wonderful cheese in mecca cheese and this is my little viewer who asked me to make this menu for him or her I think it's a girl thank you so much for asking you know I take your request very seriously and basically if I don't know how to do it I won't ask somebody and I learn how to do it and put it out there so thank you so much for watching for subscribing for picking up the book and for just being a
