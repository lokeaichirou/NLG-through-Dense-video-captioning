 Oh Goodson Todd and thank you for joining us again for cooking with us as you may or may not know my husband and I just got back from a trip to Europe and the last place you stayed was Munich Germany so today we're going to make German potato salad and bener schnitzel and the inner schnitzel actually means well the schnitzel part just means it's a breaded usually veal cutlet that's fried but the Wiener part means that it's actually from Vienna we also went to be in this so it kind of works out and my husband this one actually ate a lot of leadership so while we were in Munich we're gonna make that today German style potato salad is very different most paterno salads that we've had in the United States and that involves boiling Yukon Gold potatoes potatoes so we're gonna first start with bacon can't hurt everyone loves bacon bacon you know the pencil with a mess is a let's start that really we're boiling our potatoes for 23 minutes since we're using your fish burger hopefully it'll be a little bit less you can't find me red onions here but we got one chopping the red mm-hm we only 1 tablespoon of dill now we're going to chop our dill into tiny pieces so writing 1 teaspoons of sugar to it will be our mixture for our potatoes 2 teaspoons of salt and then says 1 or fresh cracked pepper 3/4 of a cup red wine vinegar 3/4 1/4 cup chicken stock I almost look gelatin I've never reserved bacon I'm no reserve okay we're gonna do two teaspoons of the bacon fat he's everything cool for a little bit before you remove the skins to hold it like this and this game just peels off no that's why you've saved your hand from being burned mm-hmm we cool so you remove the skins from gently mix it cuz they're very uh they're very easy turned emotion we don't want that is this good enough of that so this looks really a lot more liquidy than what the recipe shows he's good now thank you okay all right so we our winner gonna sell it to just wrap to me as well as you've been agreed with Terrence does it tastes authentic from over in Germany so I guess I didn't eat it then so I believe him and now we're going to start with our first finisher and there we used breakfast in my life before so a little thing is two eggs some say 3 since the large pot in the news 3 okay we tried to get the veal cutlets frankly super rough and mixing the babies inner sense a little but the only bill cutlets we could find at the major market here we're frozen so these are tenderize the pork chops so we don't have to be then then they're pretty thin so that works out for us cuz we don't have a meat mallet first you dredge it in the flour che guevara put it in the eggs don't push the red comes into it the bread comes we'll just make a layer on the outside so isn't lightly not hurting good enough I mean I guess and then that's it until it dries out a little bit okay that's - it's fine if you're looking for lard in the store miss if I could just said lard on it it's what's for dinner okay so this is a person I've ever seen lard in person or bullet in my hands how much later I said it has to be it has to go to the size of your frame and a quarter-inch so the video is hardened melted obviously temperature at the lardons be 30 degrees before you even try to these guys in because what you want to do is put them in cook them for three to five minutes on one side flip them and we flip them you're gonna starve in the oil of the lard on top because that's gonna keep it crispy and then we put it in our oven was just at 10 degrees or not and waiting okay oh good boy is that babe and that is a lot of lard maybe this is gonna be the best dinner year very so okay so now we're going to the dangerous task of our generation insulin very good and that's the really the way you're supposed to eat it ma'am hi it's next morning last night we enjoyed very much our readers pencils and our potato salad um it's supposed to be about the Pinto salad sitting on your plate for a little while doesn't seem as vinegary at all it's actually quite good I'm gonna share this with my husband for breakfast even though you had to last night and only have one we should obviously be a lot more than four but now we know how to make of him there easy I just made coffee as you can see I'm being the dutiful wife house making it so that makes it breakfast right but to give a solid finish to the to the video which I don't think I I did last night honestly it's best to eat the finish myself right away because it's very crunchy and good so as you can kind of see this is our plate of leftover readers missile and salad I put some lemon juice on top and not burn a small right but whatever apparently I figure buddy something tastes good of it like this you notice that I've never stood watching my own videos so the Venus pencil is freakin good super easy to make and you should definitely try it it's meeting it's like Germany cuz that's rate most of it but I would say it should also taste like in Vienna or anywhere in Austria I guess the potato salad is singularly villages well there you have it everybody this pork version of winter sensible has the A+ thumbs up from me and didn't have one from there as well he's gonna go down the eat it for breakfast you know enjoy and who's not at eat thanks for joining us and ciao -
