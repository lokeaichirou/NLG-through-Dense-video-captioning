 hi it's a nice sunny morning and I've got a few of my friends coming over to my place so I'm just gonna cook off some nice crunchy vegan caesar salad for them so I'm doing a vegan Caesar salad the original recipe has got anchovies and eggs in it I'm going to do it without the egg and without the anchovies so around 7 a close of garlic it was just nice and crushed garlic now pour some salt over this and just kind of mash it through so we're just chopping the garlic now I'll use some bacon mayonnaise which is without the eggs a lot of people do ask me what is a vegan and what is vegetarian the difference if you are awakened you don't even have dairy products so some nice and freshly ground black pepper into this people use a lot of red wine vinegar or red wine into this but I'm just going to use a humble lemon juice they really adds that zing to the salad and then with some cheese the best to go with this is Parmesan so now I'm just adding the cheese to it but as I was saying if you are strictly a vegan you can always use a soy-based cheese which is non lactose I've got a nice whisk so I'm just mixing the dressing now nice and thick creamy if you feel it's too thick you can add a bit more of lemon juice or any vinegar vinegar tends to thin down the dressing and it dressing so a little bit more of lemon juice into it lovely now the Caesar dressing is ready you have to be very particular about this because this is what is going to give the taste to a salad so let's taste it first yummy as I would have wanted it what next a Caesar salad is complete without good croutons or nice crunchy rustic bread now you can use a regular white bread or a slice web you can use any loaf if you have a slightly older loaf I'm using a burger bun which is as good as any loaf so just slice into it here we go nice big chunks so no tiny stuff here nice and big rustic croutons into the pan first let's put this on and then a good dollop of butter into this now if you're slightly concerned about making it more healthy what you could do is you could sprinkle some olive oil pepper like I am doing here a little bit salt here that's it some garlic flakes again as I said if you wish you can always bake them in the oven you can drizzle some olive oil if you don't want butter butter you know gives it that nutty crunchy taste so I always prefer butter and in fact I'm going to add a little bit so they're nicely crisp up so my two tones are getting ready yeah my dressing is already ready now what is left is the main salad of which I'm gonna use some red peppers some yellow peppers nicely diced almost done there let's put this off so you can see this little garlic that I was talking about it's all crisped up which is what we want nice and crispy golden brown lovely add this to this just slightly cook it in the same flavor that the garlic has given out but not too much you don't want to lose the crunchiness romaine for the deep flavor and iceberg for the nice bit of crunch so I'm going to mix equal quantities of the romaine and the iceberg you don't need to really go delicate just trace this off same again yeah just rip this apart once again nice and crunchy large chunks you've got some nice Romania and now with the iceberg the same thing there's no need to use your knife the fingers are good enough so some nice and crunchy iceberg just one important tip here if you're using any kind of lettuce make sure it's nicely washed because it's raw but the most important aspect is you drain it nicely otherwise there's going to be a lot of water in your lettuce and that's going to make a salad watery you don't want that so some nice lettuce now no excess water few nice cherry tomatoes underneath my palm and here goes mind knife like this okay so we've got this Tomatoes into this this few whole maybe yeah so nicely chopped sweet basil leaves of course this is not statutory I mean it's not compulsory to add basil I like it because it gives a fresh feed and flavor to the salad so we have got this yep some black pepper into this if you want it a little bit spicy you could always add a bit of chili flakes to it maybe a bit of Tabasco to it it's all your taste now with the dressing a little bit of the dressing inside not too much you know dressing whenever you add to a salad it's got lemon juice it's got some kind of acidity so it what it does it it makes your salad slightly wilted and soft so dressing should be added absolutely at the last minute when almost you are ready to serve the salad so I'm just going to pick it up nicely with my fingers nice and light just lays it in the center like this don't press the leaves too much you don't want them to sit down and then the lovely chain tomorrow's some of them it's quick quick now with the extra dressing just dollop swap it around because too much is going to make a salad watery so now with the peppers and the cool tones here they go all over the top lovely isn't it looking amazing so tempting salads always if you make them look good and if you really get good flavor in it it's a meal by itself and now the cheese that we have left over goes on top lovely and the last bit of black pepper on the top now what I've done is I have just slightly thinned down my dressing you can do it with water and just the thinned-out dressing Mamiya my Caesar salad is ready I can't just wait to dig into this hmm I've made my own if you guys go to make it you know how to do it so then why the wait please world
