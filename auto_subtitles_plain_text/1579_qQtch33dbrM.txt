 hey guys sometime they show you how to make bulgogi which is another very popular Korean dish so first we want to do is take two socks green onions and just chop them up and then basically half an onion and one chop that up as well all right one chop the green onions up then just chop the onion up you don't need to make them the pieces too thin just cut them and of course the main ingredient is the beef so all you need to do is just get sirloin be thrown one so you can get it like this I usually buy up these little thinly sliced pieces and just cut it up but you can actually just get a huge you know chunk of Seoul in and cut it but I find this a little bit easier to do so just take her out on the package and basically just cut it into those little slices that you know that you normally see bulgogi eat so just cut like that just cut the whole thing this is about a pound so cutting up and then go to the next step all right now for the marinade part so what you're going to need is you're going to need two tablespoons of rice wine one two and you're gonna need two tablespoons of sesame oil - and then 1/4 cup of sugar and have a cup of soy sauce because that's gonna be a marinade so what you want to do is mix this up first make sure this is all mixed together and then what you want to do is you want to let this sit for about three hours and then you can cook it a little bit oh he's been marinating for couple hours all I need to do now is just dump it into your pan your wok and then just cook it on high heat for a couple of minutes and that's basically it so here's the finished product so I hope this helped you and enjoy
