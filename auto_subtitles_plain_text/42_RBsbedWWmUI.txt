 I'm going to start with a small pork chop and what I'm going to do first is just remove all of this fat from the pork chop and once all the fat is removed I'm just going to cut it into tiny squares now to do this I'm first going to cut it in half this way long ways and this is going to make two thin pork chops now you can buy them thin at the store and cut out this step here so then I have two thin pork chops like this then what I want to do is just cut them into strips and I'm going to cut the strip's into small squares like this so that I have tiny pieces of pork just about this size you I'm going to start by just sprinkling in the ground ginger and then adding the soy sauce and then with my hand I just want to mix these ingredients into the pork once those ingredients are mixed in I'm just going to add the hoisin sauce and then again use my hands to mix it in and once that is mixed in I'm just going to cover it and let it marinate for 30 minutes now all the pork marinades one of the first things I want to do is just remove all of the clumps out of my rice and to do that I'm just going to use my hand and just kind of break up these larger clumps like this and once all the clumps are removed we can go ahead and just set it aside now here are the carrots which I've already peeled and the first thing that I want to do is just cut off the ends like this and what's the answer cut I just want to cut my carrot into about eighth of an inch pieces so I want to cut it like that and then I'm going to cut it like this so that I have small tiny squares just about that size and once all my character cut I'm just going to place them into a microwavable safe Bowl and I'm going to cover them with hot water and microwave them on high for about two minutes now this is comparable to parboiling only it's a little bit quicker now here I have the green onion which I washed under cold running water and dried with paper towels and I'm just going to chop off the end where the roots are here and also just about an inch from the top just to get rid of some of the wilted parts there and then what I want to do is just cut this into small slivers just about this size and once the green onion is chopped we can go ahead and set that aside and once the oil is hot I'm going to go ahead and add in the pour I'm just going to start by it about three four minutes you and ask you about three to four minutes I just want to kick the out and place it on a plate and set it aside you and once that oil is hot we can add our teaspoon of our chopped garlic and also our green onions and we just want to stir fry them for about 30 seconds or until fragrant and then ask for about 30 seconds you can go ahead and add our rice and we just want to stir fry the rice for about three minutes and then after about three minutes I'm just going to make a well in the center of my ride then I'm going to crack my egg directly into the center of the rice and just kind of break it up and let it cook scrambled in the middle like that I like the edges barely touched you can just go ahead and mix it into the rice like that and once the egg is girly mixed in then we can return our pork to the lock and add in our carrots and our soy sauce and then just stir mix everything up together you and once it's mixed together then you can remove it from the scene and once the fried rice is done then it is ready to serve enjoy you
