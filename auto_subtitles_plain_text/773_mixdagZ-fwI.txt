 Oh hi guys Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make some ground beef tacos really simple yet it's been requested here for so long and since Cinco de Mayo is quickly approaching I figured it'd be a perfect time to do a taco night in your house because this is what we're doing in the battalion castle this year last year was fajita this year's tacos and I'm really excited to share the recipe with you now I make tons of different variations of tacos I make pulled pork tacos I make grilled taco strip I mean tons but this is kind of basic ground beef that everyone knows and it's really simple the ingredient you don't need oh just some ground beef you'll need some finely chopped onion this is one small onion then for spices and you're going to need some ground chili onion garlic paprika oregano cumin ground coriander some cornstarch black pepper tomato sauce water some light olive oil or you could use some vegetable oil and some salt that's it you could also of course use just a packet of taco seasoning but that's usually mostly salt and I'm always advising people against it because if you've got spices in your hand and your cut board or your pantry you can make your very own taco seasoning one which is what I do so let's get started I've got a skill here with high sides with a few tablespoons a couple tablespoons of light olive oil preheating does that I'm gonna add in my ground beef I'm just gonna break it up as much as I can with my 1 spoon I'm just gonna let this cook for about 5 to 6 minutes 1 so it's mostly cook through looking good I'm gonna add in my onions now if your feet you know you take now get a lot of fat renders out from it then by all means just get rid of him but mine really did in as you can see it's not a whole lot in there at all or whatever is in there it's windy just enough to cook the onions I've just turned the heat down to about medium halfway between medium and medium-low now I'm just going to let my onions cook for about 5 to 6 this one so they've cooked down quite a bit you're still gonna break up my meat as much as possible but that's about it that looks great now at this point I'm going to season this with some salt and now this is why I prefer making my own taco seasoning because I'd like to be able to control how much salt goes into my food okay so this is ready I've turned this back up well actually I haven't turned I'm turn it back up to medium it wasn't about medium-low now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my water my tomato sauce I just said to Mater Wow whole new vocabulary they all are and then just take all of my spices and my corn starch the corn starch is what thickens the sauce so that's key here mix this up just like you would regular taco seasoning you know your taco seasoning packet just pour it in boom what I'm going to do now is what's a simmer for about ten minutes or until the liquid has reduced a bit and the sauce has thickened and we'll be ready to serve and I'll show you how I like to service for it like all my little fixing that is done and look at that mmm now just so you know this recipe works just as well with ground turkey or ground chicken it's delicious now this is done and these are some of my must-haves toppings you need your Pico I've got some black bean salsa here that I adore some guacamole I've got some shredded lettuce of course you need your taco shells they can be hard soft you name it whatever tickles your fancy and then optional well I always have on the table anyway some sour cream and shredded cheddar I don't gravitate towards the sour cream and shredded cheddar I like the creaminess to come from the from the guacamole and I like I mean I'm not a big fan of the cheddar but whatever you tickles your fancy like I said you can do whatever topping you want now I'm going to get mine started and I'm going to warn you that this is probably going to look ridiculous just because while the taco meats and like the taco filling itself is delicious I love the topping I love like mounding on toppings I don't know why I just touches that's probably why oh yes you got it had my guac that's got that creaminess the line oh yeah and then just a little bit of a lettuce right over the top this is going to look embarrassing so do not judge me because I'm sure that you have looked like this once or twice eating a taco taco night will be a success in your house if you make this recipe mmm it's incredibly simple and easy you can do any topping you want it makes a feast for everyone double up the recipe if it's feeding eight people if you're feeding for such as plenty that's it girl are in the kitchen calm to get this recipe I hope you enjoy spending time with me you
