 hey what's up I'm Tony fatso Siciliano from on the grill radio today we're going to talk about how to cook beer brats alright to get started you need 2 ingredients 1 brats 2 beer that's really about it we're going to focus on the bratwurst right now brought your soul there's a lot of fat and brats and inside that fats a lot of water and as you cook the brats that water turns the steam and the problem is a lot of times on the grill brats explode and who wants that so what we're going to do is we're going to par boil them in the beer for about 15 minutes and then we're going to finish them on the grill now to let that steam escape we're just going to take our forks and put two little holes in each of the brats this is a hole as big enough let the steam escape but it's not going to let the fat and the juices pour out as we want we don't want that we want to keep the juices the natural juices inside the brats because that's where the flavor comes after we puncture all of our brats we're going to put them in a pan of beer and the best part about this is you can keep it on your grill the whole thing happens outdoors this can happen outside roll them over about halfway through total cooking time of the parboiling is going to be about 15 minutes all happens outside on your grill our bratwurst isn't sitting in the beer now for 15 minutes we flipped it over now it's ready for the grill we parboil it to ensure that it's cooked throughout we don't want to dry out while they're on the grill we do not want to overcook them we're going to cook them over direct heat for about 4 minutes per side just to crisp up the skin we'll flip them over give them another 4 minutes they'll be done all you do after that slap them in a button put some spicy mustard on them maybe throw a little bit of sauerkraut on them and you will have amazing beer brats I'm 25 so Siciliano thanks for watching to learn more about me go to on the grill radio.com
