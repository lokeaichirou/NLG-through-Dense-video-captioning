 this is our cabbage plot we've planted our cabbage from seed last spring it is an old Irish variety called quarter hawk since October we've been harvesting cabbage it is January now and the cabbage kept well despite frost and rain the outer leaves start to turn brown but further in the cabbage is still perfect and today you're going to make sauerkraut or in Bricker behind me cabbage in Ireland people don't really eat much sauerkraut where I grew up we had it for breakfast lunch and dinner so literally all the time and I quite miss it sometimes I have a special cabbage grater which my mum gave to me and I can shred the cabbage with ease the cabbage head is not very tight so I have to keep pushing it together while I grate it is very sharp now I weigh the cabbage because I want to add the right quantity of salt one two hundred for sauerkraut so for these one and a half kilos I need 15 grams sold approximately one tablespoon I also add a capsule of lactic acid bacteria I could also use buttermilk which would work just as well to start the fermentation process then I start massaging the cabbage with my hands and soon there's liquid running off the cabbage which is good when it looks like this I stop and fill the cabbage into preserving jars I make sure to divide the liquid evenly between jars then I crush the cabbage further with a rolling pin because we don't eat that much sauerkraut we make it in small jars rather than one of those big sauerkraut earthen pots it's more practical I put a clean cabbage leaf on top and push everything down once more it is important that the cabbage is completely covered with liquid as the fermentation process is an aerobic and would be disturbed if air could reach the cabbage the jars remain room temperature for two days then we move them into a cool room for two weeks then we have a first look some people wait for six weeks but we find that often the crowd is sour enough after two weeks oh dear this one looks like it's not gone according to plan it looks a bit rotten and it smells very foul sometimes this can happen and we just throw it out this jar looks and smell is good you can see how the crowd rose during fermentation and the liquid is at the bottom some people try to avoid this by putting a weight like a stone on top of the cloud okay so hype the tape let's try sour sour and crunchy sour countries all right it's very nice and not one leaf was wasted in the process you
