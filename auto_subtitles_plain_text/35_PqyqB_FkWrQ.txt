 [Music] hi friends this week we're making wonton noodle soup a wonderfully delicious hearty dish to warm our bellies as the weather cools this dish has several recipes but I'll break down the steps to make it a breeze to prepare to make the wonton we need ground pork shrimp minced onions minced garlic moister sauce sesame oil sugar salt ground black pepper and wonton wrappers for the soup we need wonton noodles or thin egg noodles chicken broth water salt onions shrimp chives and baby bok choy if you're a garlic lover you'll also want to make this delicious garlic topping for this we need minced garlic and vegetable oil one final ingredient is roast pork I shared this recipe earlier so please check out my channel or click the link to see the video let's start first by preparing the noodles place the noodles in a large colander now take each bundle and loosen the strands bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil and then add the noodles stir the noodles in the hot water and cook for just one minute as the noodles are thin they cook really fast so avoid overcooking them pour the noodles into a colander now we rinse with cool water several times to stop the cooking process toss the noodles in the colander shaking off as much of the remaining water as possible now spread the noodles onto a large plate and allow them to air dry while we continue with the next steps I like to put down a piece of paper towel to help absorb the moisture next we make the filling for the wonton we start first by thinly slicing the shrimp let's add it into the bowl where we have the ground pork now for the seasonings let's add the minced onions minced garlic moister sauce sesame oil sugar salt and lastly black pepper mix everything together combining all the ingredients well now we can make the wontons take one of the wrappers and place it on a cutting board with one of the corners pointed toward you place about a half a tablespoon of filling onto the wrapper dip your finger in water and run it along the top edges of the wrapper take the corner closest to you and fold it over lining up the edges now press down along the edges to seal the wrapper gently press your finger into the wonton making a small indentation wet your finger again and dab it on the right corner of the wonton now bring the corners together so the wrapper overlaps pinch it together to seal it there are lots of variations when making wontons but this is my favorite and it's pretty simple and keep going until all of the filling is used bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil and then add the wontons a few at a time gently stir the wonton making sure they don't stick to the bottom of the pot cook the wontons for just 5 minutes stirring occasionally avoid rapidly boiling the water as it will cause the wonton wrappers to break scoop out the 1-ton using a slotted spoon give it a quick shake to remove the excess water and then transfer into a colander the next step is to make the garlic topping and this is super easy in a small skillet add the minced garlic and vegetable oil saute the garlic over medium high heat until it's golden brown this takes approximately 2 minutes now for the final part making the soup in a medium saucepan add the chicken broth and then add the water now add the quartered onions don't worry we're not eating all of these onions they're used to sweeten the broth cover the pot and bring the broth to a boil turn the heat to low and simmer the broth for 5 minutes now that the broth is sweetened we can scoop out the onions let's give the broth a taste adjust the salt or sugar levels to your preference I'm going to add a little bit more salt add the baby bok choy to the broth and cook for just one minute turn off the heat and now add the shrimp to stir add a generous amount of the noodles into a bowl and then sprinkle half a TSP of sesame oil on the noodles add several pieces of the one-time and then some slices of roast pork add the bok choy and the shrimp let's add the fresh chives on top ladle a generous amount of the broth into the bowl add the delicious garlic topping and we finish with some freshly ground black pepper hi I hope you've enjoyed this easy how-to video if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post below for full recipes check out runaway rice calm I work on new recipes each week so please subscribe to my channel to stay tuned this is Trang wishing you good eating and good health thanks for watching
