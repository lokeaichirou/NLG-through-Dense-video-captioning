 hey you guys I'm chef Michael Symon and I'm gonna show you how to do one of my favorite things tailgating we're gonna amp it up just a little bit we're gonna go from tailgating 101 to tailgating 201 just by doing a couple little things to make your tailgate just a little better so my favorite thing when I'm tailgating it's a little cold outside I love bratwurst everybody those bratwurst and there's a great way to do them when you're tailgating the first thing I do is I like to poach them and then I finish them on the grill serve them with a little bit of spicy mustard it's delicious so we make this really easy poaching liquid I take some jalapenos split them in half bay leaf couple cloves of garlic right into our pot and we just chop up a red onion you could leave the skins right on here because it's just gonna add a little flavor to the dish you don't have to get too cutesy with this whole thing so that goes in next I like to use a little bit of Knob Creek ride because it is spicy like my jalapenos it's gonna add another layer of flavor to the bratwurst which is gonna make it extra delicious so we go with a little bit of the Knob Creek rye again the better ingredients you use the more delicious it's gonna be cooking is really simple like that we take your favorite beer I like like a wheat beer would be great here put that whole beer in and then some water just enough so we could cover our brats a nice pinch of salt some cracked black pepper now the reason that we do this is when you're tailgating sometimes it gets a little crazy you don't want to have to worry that much so you want to keep it easy you want to it's the kiss method you got to keep it simple Simon so we put our brats of the liquid we put this liquid over about a medium-high on the grill it's gonna come up to a simmer as soon as it hits a simmer you could just drop it back down so they're just gonna cook through but you don't have to worry about them overcook so I when I these brats goal in this liquid once at 30 minutes they're ready to go and then just drop that liquid down below a simmer they stay perfect throughout the entire game if you're hanging in the parking lot when they're ready and your friends are ready to eat I just drop them on the grill and they have now they have all that great flavor everybody's done beer raised brats but you kind of tighten them up with that right Knob Creek throw a little chilies in there the onions and the garlic and you just took them something that's kind of a classic and you made it a little bit better we get the char on them they'll be ready to go a nice bun some brown mustard it's tailgate time people you
