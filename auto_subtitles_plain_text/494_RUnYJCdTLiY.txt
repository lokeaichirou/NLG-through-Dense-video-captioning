 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make basic pancakes now it is absolutely absurd that I have not made an episode on this already I mean what it was I thinking I've been gone I've been doing this for two years and not me to pay a simple plain pancake recipe and then even even dawned on me like just recently I thought all these requests are coming in I must not have an episode up already so I did it and I apologize for that and I've gotten just so many requests to make basic pancakes so I figured it is one of the most is the e and one of the easiest recipes you'll ever make and this is my recipe that I have been using for years and years and years and when you see how easy it is to make you'll never go back to the box stuff so of course before we get started let's go over the ingredients you're going to need some all-purpose flour some whole milk egg baking powder sugar salt and a little bit of butter those are you crazy ingredients can you believe it now the methods of pancakes my method anyway is the one method it's one of everything so it's a cup of flour a cup of milk a teaspoon of baking soda a tablespoon of salt a teaspoon of salt and egg that's it anything that's a little bit of butter to cook them in but just by using the 1 1 1 1 1 ratio perfect pancakes every single time so if you want to double this that's 2 cups of flour 2 cups of milk 2 eggs too so and so and so get insane so it couldn't be easier so in this bowl I'm going to mix all my ingredients and my flour I have my milk and you could use skim milk for this perfectly fine whatever you have on hand egg my baking powder sugar and I do put a little bit sugar in my recipe which I know it's a bit different but I feel like it needs just a tiny bit of sweetness you know so I do it and it works for me and you don't want to over mix this a lumpy batter is a good batter it's going to be really fluffy and delicious if you over beat this it's gonna be really dense and heavy so see what I did I just ever so lightly mixed up together and that's it it's completely done now another important step is that you let this sit for about five to ten minutes it relaxes the gluten which means you're going to get a really fluffy pancake so I'm just going to clean up let this leave it alone for about five minutes or so and then we're ready to cook them up okay my batter has been resting for about five minutes so we are ready to cook them up now I have a little griddle here that's been preheating over medium heat and all I'm going to do is stick a little bit of butter because it's a stick of butter you could do whatever you want increasing however you want and I'm just going to lightly grease it um because I don't want a ton of butter like I don't want a tablespoon of butter to cook my pancakes in maybe I'm just a big weirdo I don't know but I don't like the taste of pancakes cooked in a ton of butter don't ask I don't I'm a bit strange I don't know so you have your batter ready just give this a nice little stir that's perfect I'm not even going to bother going any further with that and now we're just going to cook them up I'm just going to use a little bit in a ladle like this and just put them right onto your griddle and these are going to cook up and once you start to see bubbles then you know you are ready to flip them and I'll show you what that looks like just ready to flip my last two and as you can see all the little bubbles on top that's when you know you're ready to flip see that perfect and I always find that your first batch of Pancakes always come out a little bit wonky donkey but then the rest of them come out perfect don't ask why they just do these are going to cook for another 30 seconds if that they really cook in no time on the second time when you flip them you're just looking for that beautiful golden color I'm going to remove them and eat them here we go and that is our quick and easy everyday pancakes which I look at the color of those I have just got to just get myself a taste you can top them with butter I don't like to put on them with butter I just like a little maple syrup over the top like I'm simple I like I'm good I want to eat some oops I'm gonna get a big bite that one mMmmm Oh God perfect every single time it doesn't get any easier than one one one one one remember that but the recipe is going to be on WWE laurainthekitchen.com so go on there get the recipe print it out if you want to then get in your kitchen tomorrow morning and make these pancakes because they are so good and so see you later
