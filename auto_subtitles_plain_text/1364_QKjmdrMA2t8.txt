 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the world's fastest meatballs that's right i'm going to show you an incredibly fast no chop meatball mixture but wait that's not all not only is this a no chop a meatball recipe it's a no roll meatball recipe and yet with all those shortcuts it's still incredibly delicious and this is how you make it okay so the best part about a note chop meatball recipe is the no chopping part so you're just gonna take some ground beef and ground veal by the way you can use any combination of beef veal and pork so I crumble that in a bowl alright and then in a small bowl I'm going to take some plain breadcrumbs I'm gonna add some milk one whole egg some dry Italian herbs have a little touch of granulated garlic little splash of olive oil a big pinch of red pepper flakes and then we're going to mix that together with a whisk by the way instead of calling this the wet breadcrumb mixture we call it a slurry it's shorter and sounds more official so when you're slurries mix set that aside and it's back to the bowl of meat which we're now going to season with salt black pepper and for me just a little pinch of white pepper and if you don't have it that's fine after the salt and pepper I'm going to add some Parmesan cheese the real stuff from Parma Italy all right at that point you're going to transfer your slurry mixture into the meat Bowl and you're going to give it a good mix and for my next trick I'm going to turn a wooden spoon into a rubber spatula in three two all right so we're gonna mix that together stop worrying about over mixing this meatball recipe is indestructible so I'm not saying intentionally over mix it but once it's mixed stop so right there I'm good I'm going to stop and begin to shape the meatballs but before we shape them I'm gonna need you to line a baking sheet with some aluminum foil and then brush it lightly with oil and then for the most time-consuming step in making meatballs the rolling except we're not going to roll we're gonna scoop besides being fast because it's no chop this method uses a scoop instead of rolling so you're just going to take one of these small sorbet scoops they sell them at every kitchen supply store and by using this you can scoop a whole tray like that in about five minutes and you're going to get the same basic shape except they're going to have extra nooks cranny's which is an advantage all right ask anybody that slices sandwich meat surface area equals flavor okay so I know they're a little rough around the edges in fact I have like a pet nickname for him I call these my Rough Riders and yes I've heard through the grapevine that DMX is not happy about that but that's another story and this method really does save a tremendous amount of time so we're going to scoop all that out it should fit on one sheet tray once they're scooped we have to brown them this can also be a time consuming step some people fry some people baked we're going to go even faster we're simply going to brown those under a hot broiler it's going to take like half the time the baking or frying wood and as soon as they're browned you're done now if you're not interested in the world's fastest meatballs but are fine with one of the world's fastest meatballs you can flip these over and brown the other side if desired I didn't but feel free now ideally as your meatballs were browning you already had a pot of pasta sauce on the stove already hot you're going to transfer your meatballs in and as soon as that comes back to a simmer you're ready to eat so if your sauce is already hot start to finish you can do this recipe in about 3540 minutes okay and of course if you have an extra 15 20 minutes maybe a half hour let the meatball simmer in the sauce a little bit it's only going to make the sauce more flavorful so don't worry about overcooking the meatballs or give them getting tough not going to happen okay and you know how this story ends right we put it over spaghetti we top it with some extra parmesan and we dig in there you go the world's fastest meatballs like I said despite saving all that time with the know chopping and the know rolling and the know frying or baking it still comes out amazing and you have to take my word for that but these were really good a fabulous plate of spaghetti meatballs of course it's not going to be as epic as the traditional methods but it's not supposed to be this is like a weeknight you're craving spaghetti and meatballs but you don't have hours and hours to spend this is a great alternative so I hope you give it a try head over to food whooshes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
