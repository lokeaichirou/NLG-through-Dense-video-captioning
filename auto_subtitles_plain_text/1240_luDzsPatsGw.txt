 this Tim really excited because we're going to do a fava which is a very traditional French speciality from the southwest part of France that people from the South was part of France they eat it regularly as part of their their regular meals but the rest the people in France and the rest of the world eat it at very special occasions so we've made one today for Christmas in New Year's and we're going to enjoy it we have here a nine hundred gram fall liver which normally they're about six hundred ours is quite big and what we're going to do is we're going to prepare the fall and we're going to put it in the tub main and then we're going to put it in the oven for 100 and 140 degrees Celsius for an hour and a half okay so there's actually two moves to to the flop the liver and what you need to do is we need to open it in between the two lobes so you cut and between the two lobes open it up and your you need to devein it and you need to take out the part that is reddish some of the nice helping me I've never done this before so you actually have to just sort of pull the veins out don't cut them out like there we go and just sort of there we go part that's red just sort of scrape over to clean it out nothing I'm gonna put each other that's a [ __ ] baby so we're opening it up to try to get this one vein out here or just sort of evicted well with you with do it with your hands and sort of just a kinda like with shrimp actually and you're just trying to take out this vein where it is and do it with your hands because you don't want to cut into the again and just pull it out there you go you close it back up perfect so we're just going to clean up a little bit a little bit like surgery and we're getting all the the red off so you use a paper towel and go over it turn it over so that it is clean so we have here about 21 grams of goal set which is slick sea salt ground pepper and cat cat - spices the fun now deveined and wade if you put your 21 grams of salt pepper and cat piss vests on cleats so that you can marinate the flop the liver here we go okay yeah so if you just do a little back and forth here Todd make sure you get it nice and covered because this is the spice this is what's going to make it really good and what changes I suppose I would imagine a different recipes of fog off because the liver itself of course tastes pretty normal and then durian this is my first time doing this never done it before anything's possible make sure you get the spices all over a little bit like marinating a steak sample set no wish to sour sauce back off no almighty squish amen okay okay so then take the rest of your salt and pepper sprinkle it on it's a little bit messy and so now we let that sit for six hours and we're going to come back and do the rest of it okay okay so it's been six hours this has been going off in the fridge we've already prepared it and so now what we've done is we've taken this is what they call in France and the Dead Valley and what we're going to do is we're going to put water in it and put it in the oven at 140 degrees until it starts to Frizzle bit selves up just a little baby bubble I've gone ahead and warmed the water a little bit so that we can go a bit faster there we go and then I'm going to go ahead and put this in the oven to warm up liquidy and what we're going to do the final step is to take cognac we all have on mony AK and cognac here and my father-in-law said that probably cognac would be the best so what we're going to do is we're going to take two tablespoons of honey on and we're just going to drizzle it on top so here we go with one drizzle it on top and around the edges sort of bathe it on top and to this makes the photo even more French because cognac of course is French there we go from the region of cognac which is near and Faldo okay so now the fault is at 140 degrees constant and so we've got the belly which is the waterproof and what we're going to do is pull this out just a little bit we want to do is place the funnel which we recently put into the taylean into the belly and the water needs to go 50 percent up the italiana clothed into the middle of the fool and we're leave in there an hour and a half we heard little ding ding I'm gonna take out just the timing so that we don't hot water on this I just want to bring yourself see here maybe I'll just take this big black thing out look forget it do all that and all that liquid there is going to freeze up and that's what becomes the yellow what's fat the yellow fat all around the fog ah we did it let it cool for one hour and then put it in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before you eat it that's exciting oh wow so now it's the next day we're going to see what it looks like the Frog ah hmm all finished hmm Oh
