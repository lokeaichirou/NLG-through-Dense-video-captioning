 [Music] welcome to Japanese cooking 101 today we are making Diamond lemon is a very popular noodle soup in Japan there are millions of lemon restaurants in Japan from mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants in neighborhoods lemon street cards open late at night to sophisticated lemon specialty shops one thing that they have in common is that they all think that the element is the best they spend hours or days to prepare good broth and the ingredients of the soup at the top secret although usually pork chicken or seafood is used for the base of the soup and that it's then seasoned with soy sauce missile or salt the type of noodle to use is just as important the wheat noodles called chuckerman must have a firm and chewy texture so how do we make our lemon as good as the lemon shops in Japan honestly that's a mission impossible however we can make it almost as good and easy enough to make it at home we'll show you how here are the ingredients we use pork to make our broth and also use the meat as toppings good sea salt fresh ginger garlic and lots of green onions soy sauce sake salt and sesame oil for flavor our biggest secret is the noodles it's very hard to find good chukerman noodles outside of japan especially the fresh kind we tested different types of dry chukerman that are sold in the US but none of them came out as good as we wanted so what's the secret believe it or not we are using fresh angel hair pasta which you can find in the refrigerated section at many grocery stores we boil the pasta with baking soda to get a distinct lemon noodle flavor and some blanched bean sprouts and boiled eggs for toppings for exact measurements of the ingredients as always please visit our website Japanese cooking 101.com let's begin the day before we salt the pork just sprinkle some sea salt on the surface of the pork and rub it well then wrap the meat with a plastic wrap and keep it in a refrigerator overnight or up to 2 to 3 days so the next day we put the salted pork in the pot with water and add slices of fresh ginger and green onions bring it to a boil and simmer for one and a half hours and remove the pork and strain the liquid into another pot now we are seasoning the soup add soy sauce sake salt and some sesame oil and keep it hot while we'll prepare the noodles and the toppings just like making pasta that timing is everything and you need to have everything ready to go before the noodle is cooked chop up some green onions and slice the pork you should also have the bold eggs and the sprouts ready to go then the noodles add some baking soda in the hot water be careful because it may boil over and add some angel hair pasta make sure you don't overcook the noodle remember that the texture is very important now that looks ready then drain the water and quickly serve in the bowl add some hot soup and a couple of slices of pork some bean sprouts boiled egg and lots of green onions this doesn't look so bad with the limited ingredients outside of Japan we can still make tasty ramen right at home [Music] you
