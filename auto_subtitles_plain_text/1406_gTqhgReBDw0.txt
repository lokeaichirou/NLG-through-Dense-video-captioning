 Gallaher's bucks yes we make three different types of box tea boiled baked and pan the most important thing with the box to use the potato got it use a flowery potato if you can get one I'm using roosters today Mars pipers are very good first thing you do is get your grated raw potato you're gonna have 200 great 200 grams of grated raw potato 200 grams of cooked mash about 240 grams of flour again the flour will depend on the type of data you using at the time of year into a cloth nice clean cloth purposes this is to extract as much moisture out of the potato as you can this is quite important for the potato to bind it and it's also getting some of the starch out of it you'll see it just pour straight out of it and get it as dry as possible very important for the mix we're gonna let that settle on the bottom of that you'll find the starch this can go into our mix here in with a cooked mashed potato in with some flour because I'm gonna make a batter out of this to make pancakes but this is the basic mix for your boiled baked and pan the difference is how you finish it out - it's put a bit of salt in there another look a little bit of a little bit of white pepper give it a bit of flavor next we add the milk we got to make a batter out of this so don't add it all in at once I just go about half you can stir that around get the consistency you want the less milk you put in the ticker of a pancake you're gonna make is it gonna make a nice batter like any batter you just gotta let it sit for a little while sit for about 20 minutes and come back and kick get your pan going and you're ready to cook the excess liquid that you've squeezed from the raw potato has got all the starch which you know after about 20 minutes centers at the bottom you can pour off the liquid and leach from some places that would have used the liquid but there you got the starch at the bottom so the starch add it back into the mix maybe your batter littell help find it a little bit mix it right in there and this you got to leave like any batter for about 20 minutes to settle you get perfect pancakes right the batter is ready now in the pan I've got a little bit of butter and olive oil for this we're going to put a ladle full of our mix right in the center like so spoon it around I'll let that cook nice and gently so you let it cook gently on one side it's going to take about three minutes either side to cook but you get it moving and once it's cooked out and dried on this side you can flip it nice golden color that's what you're looking for in the box-t the box he's finished now we just played it up and to say box D on the griddle box D on the pan if you can't make box - you'll never get a man
