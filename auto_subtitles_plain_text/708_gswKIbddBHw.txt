 hi everyone my name is Lila and welcome to my kitchen I hope everyone had a wonderful New Year's I know in my last video I mentioned that I've gone down to Palm Beach but I also went to New Jersey to spend some time with my family during Christmas as well so now I'm very far behind and I need to get caught up and I also wanted to do some videos for Chinese New Year which is coming up on January 23rd I believe so today I'm going to be making some pot stickers now I have another pot sticker recipe which has the meat filling but these are vegetarian pot stickers for those of you who don't eat meat so let's go ahead and get started on this recipe for this recipe I'm using a 14 ounce bag of coleslaw mix a package of potsticker wrappers if you're vegan make sure to get the ones without the egg a 15-ounce can of straw mushrooms stir fry oil which has the flavors of garlic green onion and ginger already infused in it sesame oil and garlic salt first drain the can of mushrooms and then chop them into smaller pieces next heat a nonstick pot on high and add 2 tablespoons of the stir-fry oil when the oil is hot add the coleslaw mix mushrooms and a half a teaspoon of garlic salt stir fry for about 6 to 7 minutes or until the cabbage becomes soft make sure to stir constantly so that the cabbage does not Brown then remove it from the heat and let it cool down about 15 minutes once the filling is cool then it's time to fill our wrappers place the wrapper on a plate or work surface add some of the filling then using your finger wet the edges with a little bit of water then fold it in half sleek the outer edge and then pleat the entire top edge using your index finger as a guide pleat the end and press firmly to seal then place the finish pot sticker on a plate and continue wrapping the rest once all of the wrappers are filled heat a large nonstick pot that has a tight-fitting lid on medium-high add one tablespoon of sesame oil and spread it around evenly using a paper towel then add about 15 to 20 pot stickers keep in mind that you want to space them out so that you don't overcrowd the pot you may only be able to add ten or so depending on the size of your pot next add 1/2 a cup of water cover and let them cook for 8 minutes or until the water boils out then remove the lid and let it cook one more minute then carefully remove them from the pot and serve enjoy for complete ingredients and instructions click the link below thank you for watching
