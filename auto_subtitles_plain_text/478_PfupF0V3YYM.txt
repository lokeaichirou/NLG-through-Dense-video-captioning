 I'm gonna share with you three tips to make perfect fried onion rings every time I might share with you a couple of other little tips along the way you're in Steve's kitchen now let's get on and make fried onion rings now into a mixing bowl I'm just gonna put a cup and a half of plain or all-purpose flour and I'm gonna be making a beer batter here you could use a different liquid I've got a 330 mil bottle of great Australian beer and I've measured that out into her cup and 3/4 you could use lemonade you could use fizzy water whatever really whichever you prefer I really like a beer batter and you see that's going to froth up and aerate the batter nicely I'm just going to use a whisk now and bring this up to a nice thick batter and as that starts to come together I'm going to add a couple of teaspoons of paprika and this is a tip it really makes crispy batter it's not one of the main tips but two teaspoons of sugar that will make your batter lovely and crisp I've got one teaspoon of garlic powder and a couple of teaspoons of salt and we continue to whisk this together now seasoning is very important I'm going to be putting a little black pepper in here tip number one taste your batter if your batter tastes bland it ain't gonna taste any better when you fry it so make sure you've got all the seasoning just right so we're set the batter aside and prepare our onions tip number two and know it doesn't matter whether you use red brown or white onions they're all absolutely delicious don't cut your onions so thin if we use skinny little onion rings like this you're going to end up with just batter and no flavor cut your onion rings about a centimetre 1/2 an inch wide it'll make wonderful onion rings and you can take the outer skin off after you've cut them it's so very simple and then what you're going to have is these wonderful thick onion rings trust me they're going to taste delicious and when you've sliced the Rings take a little bit of flour in another bowl pop the onion rings in there and just give them a little like dusting that'll just absorb some of the moisture off your onion rings before we fry them tongs are really great when you're making onion rings two sets of tongs are fantastic one set for handling in the batter one set for handling in the fryer look you'll see what I mean as we go along so here are my onion rings coated in flour my batter here I'm gonna drop them into the batter now you can use your fingers you are gonna get messy but by using tongs we can coat those onion rings in the batter and then we can lift them up let them drain just a little bit which leads me to tip number three make sure your oil is hot 190 degrees Celsius or 375 Fahrenheit if it's too hot they'll burn if it's too cold they'll just get all soggy and when the oil is the perfect temperature we can just lift those onion rings and if you've got the tongs you can just drop them in for a few seconds hold them and then just drop them and let go just take a second one in there just hold it by holding them with the tongs and just letting them in slowly they start to crisp up and they won't all stick together now using my second pair of tongs I'm going to let these cook for one-and-a-half minutes I'm gonna flip them over and cook them for another 1 and 1/2 minutes so it's 3 minutes in total of perfect onion rings I'm just gonna flip those over now see they're lovely and golden brown on that side and because we put the sugar in that batter these are gonna stay lovely and crispy it's almost like frying doughnuts and actually good onion rings should look like doughnuts now that's a minute and a half and look we've got these wonderful golden onion rings just gonna pop them on to a little bit of kitchen paper towel and let the excess oil drip off so they're my tips for making wonderful onion rings every time and of course the proof of the pudding is in the eating come down here take a look at these don't they look delicious I've got some homemade ketchup here you can hear they're lovely and crisp I've got to give this one the taste test here goes they taste absolutely perfect you have to try these next time you make onion rings please give it a go share the love give this on the thumbs up I'll see you in the next video take care now off you go I've got to sit and eat myself some onion rings I'm going to leave some links here probably to that ketchup that I made and maybe another video as always I love to hear your comments subscribe to the channel I'll see you next time
