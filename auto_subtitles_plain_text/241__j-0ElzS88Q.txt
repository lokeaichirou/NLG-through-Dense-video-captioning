 falafels Michelle okay this this one is definitely dear to my heart because this is my mom's recipe and I grew up having this at least once a week so we're actually starting these are frozen fava beans and really important paper towel underneath because moisture is your nemesis here when you're making falafel because the least amount of moisture means the least amount of flour means the least amount of gumminess inside of your falafel they have chopped garlic I'm gonna add that green onions that have been chopped hot chili flake because again this is a very rich product here we have cumin that we toasted and ground tablespoon of salt cilantro parsley and I added a little bit of English peas we're not gonna over mix this okay I wanted a little chunky I love the color of the peas and this is all about consistency and flavor obviously always flavor you're sure thank you so I like I want to make sure that those spices are coming through make sure you get a little garlic remember it will mellow out a little bit cuz you're gonna pan-fry it in oil I love it it has good spice to it it has a good spice to it and so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna go ahead and scoop this and we're gonna test one see how firm I'm going here on the side because I'm packing it right in right in there and you would just scoop all of these and go ahead and let them set up in the refrigerator for about an hour before you start cooking them is this something that you could do ahead of time if you were entertaining - how long you could leave this overnight in the fridge and see I just really patted it down I kept that nice shape that it had yeah and I'm gonna put it in here and so we're just gonna coat this is that the thickness that we're looking for it is that's exactly the thickness you're looking for and that's a great question because you can see it's about half an inch thick mm-hmm I'm gonna go ahead and just drop it in there and we tasted the mix so all we're really doing now is checking for the fact that it sticks together so we're gonna scoop a few of these okay Michele so now I'm gonna flip my falafel this is absolutely one of those you never overlook a ham all the time all the time and actually this is this would be a really fun job for a kid I'm sure and you can see this is a we did great Michelle oh growing up in a Middle Eastern family everything that we ate at home we everything had high spice high acid hi sweetness high fat content in it and so that's kind of where my love for balanced food came from so I'm gonna squeeze some lemon on here just to give it a little acidity because this is rich I'm gonna eat on this one I was gonna tell you you better get in on this this they're really flaky Michelle you did a great I could tell by the sound when we're cutting into this mmm not dry they fall apart they crumble that's what you want right there see how it crumbles that's what you want really mom I wish your mom were here give her a giant hug she'd ask me where the peas are doing in it this is incredible and I really feel like I'm getting to know you a little more by eating these foods that you grow up with well whenever you're ready to go to Ellensburg Washington Michelle it's waking up my mom I'll do it I would love that you
