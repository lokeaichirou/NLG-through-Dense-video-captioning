 hello and welcome to actual kitchen today we will see how to prepare nan for which we will need the following ingredients to prepare approximately 4 to 5 average-sized nons 2 cups of plain flour maida or all-purpose flour some extra virgin olive oil 3/4 teaspoon of sugar 3/4 teaspoon of salt 3/4 teaspoon of yeast and 1/8 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 tablespoons of yogurt first I am going to mix all the ingredients in a large bowl the plain floor East sugar salt baking powder and finally the yoghurt along with this I am going to add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and I am going to mix them all well and I am going to add you warm water and mix it to adore so since I am using a fast action east I need not soak it in warm water so I am dadly using it if you are using the ordinary East check the specification and use accordingly also don't use cold water then it will not activate the East at the same time if you are using very hot water it will kill the yeast so finally I have a sticky dough it should be little bit sticky so that you get soft nonce now I am going to apply some more oil on the top grease it well and I am going to allow it to race for an hour if your place is a little bit chill then you will need 2 to 3 hours usually I put it in a warm oven so that it rises in one hour and now it is perfect that's doubled in size and it is very soft next I am going to start rolling out the nonce first I am going to dust the worktop with some plain floor and then I am also rubbing some floor in my hands and I have taken a small ball of dough in my hands I am going to roll it out just a little bit if you want you can use more to dust the surface and after rolling it to a small circle I am going to flip it in my hands so that I get a oval shape as in the restorin and now my nan is ready the next important step is I am going to apply some water on one of the sides and I am going to spread it with my finger so that the entire area is covered with water you can use more water if necessary and now I am going to put this water cider nan on the tava use a very hot lava you can see now the water is dripping the water side goes on the tawa only a very high heater tava will give you good nonce so after a few seconds you will get bubbles coming out at this stage I am going to turn my tava upside down with flame at high and I am going to cook the nan on the other side on high flame and you can see naan is ready and I am going to tear it out from the tava and wow you can see the excellent texture of the naan as in the rest orang this is plain naan I have some melted butter which I am going to apply on the non then it becomes butter naan this non very soft and will be well cooked inside but if you don't have a gas stove you can make use of their oven I have you stir these are stoned here I have heated it at maximum temperature and on the hot piece of stone I have place that nan I have not applied any water for this baking of naan and after a few minutes the naan will be ready this is oven-baked nan again apply some butter on the top but believe me the naan from the style is more softer than the oven on and next for garlic naan i am grading one clove of garlic on top of the north and then I am dusting it with some floor so that the moisture from the garlic is observed and I am going to gently roll it again a little bit so that the garlic gets pressed inside that naan and now you turn it to the other side and apply water on the other side do not apply water on that side where you have applied the garlic and now again put the water side on the tava so that your garlic side comes up and after it gets some bubbles turn it to the other side and let it cook on the flame sometimes your nan may fell off from the lava but never mind it will be still perfect you say tongs and cook it fully and your garlic naan is ready apply some butter on the top and you can smell the flavor of garlic coming out try it and you'll really love it thank you for watching Oxus kitchen
