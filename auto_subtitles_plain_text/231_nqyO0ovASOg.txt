 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make potato hash now this is not to be mistaken with hash browns because for me there are two completely different things and in a future episode I would love to share my recipe for hash browns but for right now I'm gonna make potato hash and let me take you over the ingredients so we can get started you're gonna need some potatoes peeled and diced I'm using Yukon Gold and I cut them into about half-inch little cubes like that you're also going to need some chopped up red bell pepper onion some fresh parsley garlic salt and pepper and a little bit of olive oil and a 10 C bit of butter now like I always said potato hash and hash browns for me or two different things these are like the little cubes of potatoes that are mixed with veggies and cooked and crispy and delicious and then the hashbrowns or the shredded kind that get really crispy but they don't normally have any veggies in them this happens to be my favorite way of eating them I do prefer them over ash Browns but to be honest I like them both so today I'm doing this kind now in this large skillet I have some olive oil and a little bit of butter and I'm melting that over about medium heat and you could also use any other kind of potatoes I prefer the Yukon Gold they're so buttery they got like a sweet buttery rich taste which I adore they have my favorite potato but you can use whatever you want obviously now once that comes up to temperature I'm going to show you what to do next and my potatoes and this like I said is over a medium heat give us a little stir and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover them this lid obviously isn't big enough to fit the pan but that's okay what I want to do is just cover the potatoes and I'm going to let this cook for about ten minutes what I'm trying to do is cook the potatoes half way like kind of steamed them half way and then when I add my veggies and I Brown them up I'll ensure that they're completely cooked for when they develop a good amount of color I'm not nervous that they're cooked on the outside but now on the inside so I'm going to let those go for 10 minutes and then I'll show you the next step after 10 minutes I'm going to take off the lid turn the heat up to about that medium-high and give these a sturdy because so already tell they're starting to brown that is what you're looking for after that I'm going to add in my onions and my pepper and I'm going to just season that with some salt and pepper and now the important thing to remember here is not to mix them too much because if you over mix them then you're not going to get you know to form a crust on anything so what I'm going to do and give this a stir just to make sure everything is mixed together actually going to switch through this because I make sure everything is nice and flat like so and I'm going to cook it like that for about five minutes and I'm going to give it a toss I'm going to flatten it out again and go to for another 5 minutes and I'm like just continue to do that until the veggies and the potatoes just develop a nice golden brown crispy on the outside crispy color and then I'll show you what they look like once are there so just keep keep your eye on them just making sure that you always keep everything in one layer and leaving it there for a few minutes in order for that crust to form my potatoes are pretty much exactly how I want them now I'm going to sprinkle in the garlic and now I didn't add the garlic when I added the rest of the veggies because if I were to cook the garlic for that long it would burn and when garlic burns becomes very bitter I don't like that sprinkle in some parsley potatoes took about 15 minutes to develop the color now I'm just going to cook them for another minute or two until the garlic becomes fragrant look great Oh YUM that to me you're like the perfect like oh that one right there oh yeah oh yeah they're so yummy and so simple they don't take very long at all but they have definitely that restaurant quality like hashed potatoes or whatever that you're going you get on a Saturday morning for breakfast somewhere into the bomb go www.laurainthekitchen.com kits recipe I'll see you next time bye
