 I'm going to show you how to make gnomes on the hob very easy almost do what make yesterday and that's see it's quite thin or just can't fit in here there's no grease in there at all it's just a hot pan just like that and if you watch for a couple of minutes you'll see the tub as the bottom of it heats up bubbles will appear on the top just like when you go to a tenon or a restaurant and they bring out the knowledge there's all the bubbles on top I've actually found that doing it this way is better than doing it in the oven now it's obviously better in a tandoor but if you see if you get closer in there now see there's bubbles starting to appear and that means that it is cooking on the underside the bubbles will get quite large just a little ones at first that means it is starting to cook on the bottom side yet well it takes about three minutes per naan and then once they're cooked you just a butter the top of it put it in the oven now in a low oven under a towel of some sort and it will keep warm it's either getting quite large now just like at the restaurants getting nice bubbles on the top okay now how's the bubble start getting bigger check the underside again see it doesn't stick no there's no need for any grease at all on this didn't stick at all and they're getting quite nice and big a lot of times I do turn it over just to cook the other side just for a little bit that gives it some black spots or some brown spots on the other side and this is absolutely gorgeous really nice way to cook it we've done any work done while you're camping it can be done just for an easy lunch I said how'd you make this up the day ahead of time so I thought whenever I want it I do use fresh yeast my recipe is actually on my blog I do use fresh peas because I do see that works a little bit better than the packaged stuff and fresh yeast is easy to come by these days just go ask Annie Baker major Knox grocery stores got yourself an on that is alright so that's it there you go just like up I see your hand in there somebody's mom here genuine try some labor is quite nice
