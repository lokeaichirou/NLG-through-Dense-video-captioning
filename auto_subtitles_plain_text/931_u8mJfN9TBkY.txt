 fish and chips it is an Irish classic I'm from Hope a fishing village of course fish and chips is what I have grown up with but the one I'm gonna make for you today is a little bit of twist on the classic I'm gonna make beer batter fish crispy tender pieces of fish served alongside some beautiful Hasselback potatoes now if you're going to make house of black potatoes what you need to do is hit spindly slice them and we're gonna thinly slice them my top tip is to put them in the well of a wooden spoon like this and then the well in the wooden spoon prevents you from going all the way to the bottom so what you get left with is now check this out is this wonderful today dough that has a bit of movement and although that layers become really crispy but the bottom stays together do you ever be absolutely incredible once you have a big tray of these little Hasselbeck Hedgehog potatoes what you need to do is grab a little bit of melted butter and just brush each one right over the top so that all those little bits of butter melts through and into those little cracks what will happen when they come out of the oven you'll get lovely crispy little layers and served alongside our fish absolutely delicious sprinkle with a little bit of sea salt a nice crack a black pepper and into the oven where I do have some which have been cooking up you have the most crispy beautiful little layers of potatoes so served alongside our fish and chips this is essentially our chips now we need to talk about our fish the fish is a little bit unusual because it has a bigger batter and not everyone uses a beer batter but a beer batter is very easy to make so into a bowl some plain flour you need to make sure that you have nice cold beer because as soon as that cold beer with all those will be fizzy bits hits that hot pan it's gonna be absolutely delicious so just make a well in the bottom here the beer does two things in this situation it gives a little bit of flavor a kind of nice tang but it also gives a wonderful pot of batter which goes really really crispy seasoned up with some sea salt and some black pepper and this is good to go we're gonna dredge our fish so that we make sure that the batter fits around it or sticks to it so dredge it in a little bit of flour and season again with some black pepper and some sea salt once you have it nicely mixed through grab some GU Jones of haddock or card just toss it in that lovely flour when you're looking to buy fish what you want to look for is skinless fish and you want a nice piece of fish that you can cut into pieces like this they're about 2 inches by 1 inch and they're a nice hefty sized piece of fish but the thing to remember is that if you don't want to cut them up ask your fishmonger to do the job for you he'll be happy to do it tell him I sent you all my flour is coated through I lovely fish we've got our beer batter and we've got the heat on our pan of oil I've got to make two inches of sunflower oil in here heating up and the way to check that it is done is take a wooden spoon and just dip it in there and if little bubbles come up like that you are in business take your dredge pieces of fish dip them in that lovely batter and what you want to do essentially is take it and kind of drip off any excess and once you've drift off any excess get it straight in there fish really does cook quickly so it's no more than about five minutes in here so really quick you're looking for color it's done and you can hear even as they pull these out that they are kind of hollow and crackling and really nice and puffed up and golden this is beautiful beer-battered fish oh yes to go along with my lovely fish and chips I have some minty P match and I've just made this up by bubbling away some butter adding in some frozen peas and mashing it together with some mint it is so so simple to make and check this out you have got useful minty mushy peas crispy tender little pieces of fish and those wonderful little Hasselback potatoes it's a nice twist on the classic I want you to give it a go it is so so simple if you want the recipe check it out in the box below of course subscribe to the channel have you clicked it yes go on and of course give this video a big thumbs up give it a like oh my time you hear the crunch mmm so so good I want you to give it a go it's so so easy and it's a great one to make at home give it a go see you soon guys you
