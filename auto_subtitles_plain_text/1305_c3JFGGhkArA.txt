 there's a small bakery in San Francisco called Tartine and it's famous for its bread and pastries one of my favorite things to order is the croque monsieur it's an open-faced sandwich layered with the creamy bechamel sauce and topped with smoked ham and Gruyere it's so seemingly simple to make and when the flavor combinations are perfect the result is this cheesy French sandwich that's perfect for breakfast or lunch for the bechamel sauce I'm using two tablespoons of unsalted butter two tablespoons of all-purpose flour 1 and 1/4 cup of warmed whole milk half a teaspoon of nutmeg and some salt and pepper for the croque monsieur I'm gonna use 2 slices of Dale bread about an inch thick I'm using this round country loaf two big slices of smoked ham and four slices of Gruyere cheese first I'm starting with the bechamel sauce I melt the butter and a heavy saucepan over medium heat for about a minute now I'm adding in the flour and whisking it until the mixture bubbles a bit this will take another minute what I'm doing here is cooking out that raw flour taste but doing it just enough so that it doesn't Brown then I whisk in the milk and just let it boil to thicken up then I'll just sprinkle in my nutmeg because that's essential to a bechamel sauce and then season it with some salt and pepper and then I'll set it aside now to make my croque once your I start by preheating the oven to 425 degrees I spread a quarter cup of bechamel sauce onto each slice of bread and then I top it with a slice of ham and two slices of cheese then I'll bake it on a sheet until the cheese is bubbling and brown this will take 10 to 12 minutes if you're ever in San Francisco be sure to stop by Tartine and give their coq10 try another personal favorite is their banana cream pie and also their bread now I'll take it out of the oven and let it cool for about a minute I'll pair it with some salad and then it's fun at the teeth and there you have it the crook wants your if you want to croak my damn all you have to do is add a fried egg on top check out my other French recipes on this playlist and I'll see you guys soon au revoir
