 served hot or cold you know they have a lot of versatility so let's get started what I have here is some cultivated mushrooms different than wild mushrooms cultivated shiitake oyster mushrooms these you can grow right in your backyard on a board with the right soil so and also mostly available in most supermarkets and stores in America how about a little medium heat first question do you think they kid you could kind of put the food on and they would think that it was something like regular spaghetti they think it's they would think it's spaghetti for sure you could you can disguise it you could disguise it but you wouldn't have to because they're really that delicious we're gonna begin now with some heat and our shitake mushrooms inside of our skillet now you're gonna notice that like mushrooms are mostly all water so they're gonna suck up whatever oil you put in there they're gonna suck that up so we want to start cooking with that now what kind of oil is that this is a vegetable oil okay you could use canola you could use olive oil now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna make a quick little dressing for this dish so gluten free soy sauce okay this is a oyster sauce which has a pretty high sodium content so we're just gonna use a little bit of this for really for like our salt okay then we're gonna have a pinch of raw sugar the next ingredient is ponzu which is sort of a lime flavored soy sauce okay really really good any of you eat fish ponzu on fish fantastic now I'll tell you another in great ingredient and this is miso this is a red miso which is made from soybeans so we're gonna add that paste in here and dissolve that is that a spicy flavor the music uh no no it's a pretty neutral and then we're gonna have a little sake that really depends if you are into sake we're gonna do so we're gonna just dissolve that up and now let me show you how quickly this is gonna go now I have red pepper and onions that's the next ingredient as you know bell pepper is especially red pepper have more vitamin C in them than an orange and you can see how it's really soaked up all of the oil that's okay don't have to panic just add up touch more oil it's really no big deal now we're gonna add a little bit flavoring in here and then we're gonna put this dish show you how fast this is ginger garlic a little bit of green onion sometimes people would love to just take a little bit of green onion and just kind of do him in pieces like this in a lot of Asian cooking I'll just cut him in big pieces like this whatever you want to do if you want to do that that's great we'll add those in here now we'll get our flavors all together you smell that already yeah smells great so heard about being a vegetarian yes finding the protein sources I do eat fish but but finding which combinations work the biggest thing that you could do right now is this is a perfect dish if you want to put tofu yeah absolutely you could fry it you could put it right inside I've used a medium to firm tofu now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna add this really quick watch our sauce mixture is gonna go inside we're gonna take out our noodles we just sort of lightly stir fry this okay just lightly stir fry it are the noodles pick it up in the noodles are a little bit sticky yeah prepare that there already no there I just blanched them so just like spaghetti okay to the al dente now we're just gonna let this cook a little salt now if we want to get spicy now watch this this is hydroponic watercress and watercress has just been forgotten about so we're gonna cut it off its roots we're gonna add a little bit of this like a salad almost to the tray now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our futon and we're gonna bring this baby right to the platter now and we're gonna just sort of lay this right on the platter and it's gonna wilt the water crust a little this here we'll just kind of scrape down now what we're gonna do also to that is very simple we're gonna add a little bit of carrot we're gonna add a little bit of green onion we're gonna add a little bit of cilantro which is gonna add some great flavor to this and then we'll take a little bit more of our watercress just kind of cut cut it right from right from the earth and look at that there's our first meatless meatless meatless
