 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens fast food Friday today we're going to be making the most iconic fast food around the world it is something that I have received thousands of requests for and we're going to do it today homemade of course I'm talking about KFC's fried chicken he's got budget bill month is what you want Wednesday fast food Friday sweater skinny chef it's Nicko's kitchen where satisfying meals are prepared so the first thing that we're going to do to get started on our Fried Chicken is just into a bowl I've got some plain flour and we're going to season our flour first I'm going to be adding in some salt and some pepper also going to be adding in some garlic powder next is some onion powder and lastly some propria and just give that a good mix around with the flour so that's what you'll end up with a beautiful flower spice mix so we'll just put this to one side so just into a separate bowl I'm going to be putting in one egg and I'm also going to add in some milk as well and just mix the egg and the milk together just give it a whisk now of course you going to need some chicken now the chicken that I've got is some drumsticks and some wings if you wanted to do the chicken breast or the chicken tenderloin you can as well but just make sure the skin is on because that's how we're going to get that really crispy skin on the outside so what I want you to do really simple is I want you to put the chicken straight into the egg wash make sure you get everything coated and then I'm going to be putting it straight into the flour and again make sure you get this really coated well and just shake off the excess flour and I'm gonna double dip back into the egg and then back into the flour and what that will do is give us a really crunchy coating on the outside and just keep repeating that process for all the chicken that you have so once we're finished coating our chicken in the egg wash and the flour we're going to deep fry them now if it's got some vegetable oil in a large pan and I've just put a bit of flour in the egg wash just in there to see if it's ready to fry and if you do that and it sizzles and rises to the top then you know it's hot enough so we've got our chicken here or nicely coated and I'm just going to pop it in really carefully also with one of our wings as well so guys we want to cook this for about 12 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the chicken but what we want essentially on the outside is a nice dark crispy skin with that batter so guys it's been about 10 minutes you can just see here that's the color that you're after that beautiful golden brown color so what I want you to do now is just turn the heat off drain them on some paper towel and then we can get stuck into these bad boys so there you have a guys it is so easy to make the smell as one oval and just looking at that crispy skin on the outside oh man now just check that out now I'm just going to show you something just here on the skin I'm just going to pull this back just so you can see there we've got this beautiful moist chicken there and this crispy skin oh wow oh oh man oh it's hot too just check out that moist chicken in there that skin is just peeling back wow that is YUM oh so give this one a go it is so easy to do it's cheap to do and you'll have heaps of fun making it as well you guys take care I will see you this Monday for budget meals so until then take care [Music]
