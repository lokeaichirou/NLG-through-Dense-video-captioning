 hey guys thanks for stopping by ballistic BBQ today we are grilling Korean style short ribs also known as Kelly ribs love them let's get going or I'm going to start this recipe off with the marinade and even in Korea it kind of varies from family to family this is something that's sort of morphed in my household just from my discovering other Asian ingredients that being said I realized some of these ingredients on using are not Korean but tastes good good on beef pork chicken it's a good marinade we start off with 1 cup of soy sauce and I like to use a blender 1/2 cup of sugar now I'm using this palm sugar and I discovered this doing a Thai recipe stuff's great it becomes very very creamy I love the texture of this regular white sugar is perfect now I'm using a 1/2 cup of black glutinous rice wine but like a mirin would be great you don't have to use this this is again just something I like to use 1/2 of a white onion and this is a medium size your white sweet onion 1/2 cup of honey now this is something that is going to probably raise a few eyebrows but it's awesome stuff and it's fish sauce now it doesn't taste fishy it's a kind of a distilled flavor but what it is it's a flavor enhancer and I'm telling you in sauces this stuff is it's a miracle worker it brings out and enhances flavors does not make it taste like fish I swear to you it does not make it taste like fish two tablespoons of freshly minced ginger now if you don't have access to fresh ginger use powdered ginger but there's a special way that I learnt of processing this and getting it ready for the sauce if you don't do it this way you're going to end up with like fibers and you'll end up with hairy meat which is awful so what I'll do is I'll first peel the root slice it into like coin shapes then you're going to smash it with the side of your knife and what that does is it pulverize --is all the fibers and then you just finely mince it up and you won't have that problem with the hairs and I'm using one tablespoon there's a lot of sweet going on here and I like just a little bit of warmth in the back of your throat this is Korean chili paste I butcher the real name but it's a good Chang or something like that I'll put it up but if you can't find this just any chili paste will work fine all right now last but certainly not least my favorite ingredient in this marinade and that's fresh Asian pear now if you don't have access to Asian pear just a regular Bosh pear would work I mean even probably can't pears in a pinch but this just makes this recipe there's a nice clean crisp slightly sweet flavor to it now let's get this blended up now I like to start out at a lower speed on the blender here just get everything chocolate out splashing all over the place they just started creasing vsq all right so here's the meat we're going to be cooking now this is three pounds of beef short ribs and it's cut it's called flanken style which just basically means it's been cut across the bone most butcher stores will have this if not you can request it if you cut this way I personally will ask for it to be cut custom anyway I just like it a little bit thicker than the ribs that they're selling and one little tip what I like to do before I prepare these is I'll just take the tip of a knife and scrape the meat you're going to have dust on here from the bones from the bandsaw they use and I could get all that off before I put this in a marinade all right let's get these things in a marinade all right so pretty basic stuff we're going to take the container first thing I like using these things there they're made by caiman bro have a nice tight lid on them you can stack them put the ribs in here trying to make an effort to make sure they're not you know sticking together side by side know the marinade just coat the original marinade what I'm going to do now is put the lid on I want to make sure first they're fully immersed in this marinade put it in the fridge and they'll be marinating from about four to five hours before we start this cook a little longer spine I mean if you want to marinate them overnight but these are gonna be about five hours anyway I'll see at the grill all right guys are going to start grilling up these short ribs now and I'm going to start off doing it a little differently than I used to do my short ribs I used to use a direct heat throughout the entire cook now I'm starting off with an indirect heat and the reason I'm doing this is you know there's a lot of sugar in this sauce and what I'm going to do is just sort of get the carmelization going now rather than having this Hut's you know the sweet stuff dripping into this hot coals and starting flare-ups and then what I'll do is more of a kind of a I guess you could call it a reverse here well sear these after they're pretty much cooked in case I didn't mention it when I took it out of the marinade what I did was just more or less shook off the excess you can see that it's starting to kind of cook through the surface now I'm going to go and start flipping these smells really really good this one little close to the hot coal so I'll be well-done these other guys are looking really good this is going to leave us with some very very very juicy meat said as you know these are just a quarter inch thin so they don't need a whole lot of cooking alright guys now what we're going to do is just finish these off and again it's more like more or less a a reverse here get this on some direct heat it's going to top that carmelization alright guys we are done we get these on the platter and we're gonna plate it up inside alright guys here we are having this with some jasmine rice and this is a kind of a slaw that I made it's got you know some red cabbage some of that Asian pear a little cucumber some cilantro let's give this a try smells really really good cut around these bones here no no if you can see that really juicy mmm really really really tender I love this recipe it's got everything I love it's got nice amount of sweet just a perfect amount of heat it's a winner anyway guys thanks for stopping by and I'll see you in the next video
