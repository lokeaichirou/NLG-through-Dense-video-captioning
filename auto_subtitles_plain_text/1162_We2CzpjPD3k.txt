 ah there's a place in your house where it's cool to chill get some me time or even cook a meal it's the kitchen mofo in no time - slap - just grab yourself a penny and this work that a stiffy scared of this place mo needs a father just lay down your weapons and pick up another hihglight how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen today I'm going to show you how to make a classic British dinner it's called bangers and mash you might not have heard of it base basically mashed potato with sausages and it's called bangers because when you hook them in the pan that's the sort of noise it used to make if you're cooking really fast sort bang right so just call it sausages and mash if you get confused I hope it really really cool gravy it's really cheap really filling really yummy so perfect for students or people animals whatever you want to be and you'll love it it's a little Chloe she's told me how to make the recipe she's about to go to bed once you rocket asleep I'm gonna come back to the kitchen I share and make this thing right here then folks let's get on and make this recipe he's gonna be so so easy even a monkey could do it I want to think about that but a monkey probably could do it anyhow you're just gonna need three pans and we'll get them as and when one of them has got a pan of boiling water in it I'm gonna put our potatoes in there so I'm gonna mash my potato and have a bit of a rustic feel to it give them a wash and leave the skin on alternatively peel it if you don't want that skin in there make sure there's no mud on it okay cuz that won't taste good so it's gonna boil them up mash up with some other special ingredients in a bit we've got a frying pan there which is going to use for our sausages which we're going to cook first of all the frying pan the old plastic banger method you could put them in the oven under the grill if you want anyway you want this is prime yeah okay so you can see my pan is nice and hot there the good thing about this recipe is you can really go to town on it you can make it as bland or as amazing as you want you can basically just have particular smashed with sausages or you can really twist the flavors on the head which is what we're hopefully gonna do make it taste real good for you okay so that pan is hot I've got my sausages here so I'm just gonna drop one in right so just so you get the idea if when the cook comes they're nice and golden brown all around on the side and while they're cooking we can work on our gravy and our potatoes yeah I better put more sausages in otherwise getting a bit of a lonely sausage right there yeah okay amazing so all the sausage in the pan like actually only just dropped in there they're sort of putting their suntan lotion on ready to go into the Sun they're ready and I hope you are too I don't know what I meant by that but let's just go along with it anyhow you saw that panel or - is boring I've got three out of the four market is in there just drop the other one in there so the temperature does go down a little bit the after noticed though that the water level was actually quite low because when you put the potatoes in it goes like a fat person get in the swimming pool so what I'm going to do is bring that book up to the boil get a nice cook proof should take about 15 minutes let me match away let's move on to our gravy the sausages are staying on there on their own I'm gonna keep them quite bland yes okay let's go so right behind me here I've got the pan the sausages cooking away the potatoes bubbling away - and there's one other pan here which I've just started the warm up we're gonna add some oil in there I'm gonna add our onions and our leeks to start to build our gravy okay it's gonna be nice you gotta love it okay so close up on that pan now it's nice and warm so it's gonna pour in just under a 10 minute or oil and right here I have got myself a chopped onion and a chopped leek so I'm just gonna push them in gradually I'm probably know me gonna get it everywhere but this Jack get it in that's not so bad I'm normally really messy get it everywhere but so far so good yeah that is all in there to cook it away right away get it soften and more stuff we'll add to it glue it stuff fantastic - the leeks and the onions are all in there you can see they're starting to soften already oh you want them so soft baby you want them softer than Chloe's bum right now so so soft oh yeah okay let's show you where we are so the leeks and the onions as we know are breaking down in a gum and add a little bit of butters in just a minute but it's put this robot dance like that you can see the sausages I've been turning them and they're on a very low heat while there's quite a mention that just so we can time it we can always crank it up if we need to so we want to try and finish it all together okay we'll just move up a little bit TRO story you can see the potatoes over there still cooking away roaring it's all working well so we've come back to our onions and leeks now and I let go a little pot yeah okay so the banger noise I was talking about listen to this baby can you hear that yeah that's bangers okay so we don't add a little bit of fun and games to the leeks and onions otherwise it's fun and games but it is funny games right so they're nice and soft they're loving it but just so poppy they're like this so what I'm gonna do is add in a knob of butter put it straight in by that and that'll melt in and what and I mean just jumped out okay about it doesn't have to happen for you but anyhow let the heat sort of map that down stir it all through and one other cheeky thing I'm gonna add is I've got a little bit of golden syrup aka corn syrup in other countries just add a little quittin of that in there for a really naughty Spanky kick Oh stir it through okie doke that has only been two minutes you can see that butter is bubbling away in there it's full of flavor there's like a sugary using this as well from that little bit of golden syrup absolutely loving it it's gonna taste so good so grab yourself five hundred mils of water and just pour that in like so what we're gonna do is add a stock cube in with this now as well and also a cheeky little ingredient yeah okay then focus it before we sim it down our gravy we're gonna add two other things one of them is a stock coupe which is in my hand right now that's gonna chuck that in like that what half that's almost bad snow but it's all good stir that through but before we bring it to a simmer one other thing remember this is completely optional I'm gonna add some Marmite okay I'm out of it before it gives it a cheeky little kick we can also do soy sauce or Worcester sauce or some balsamic vinegar lots of different things you can add let's just try some Marmite today and I think you got to love it a little spoonful of that in there Wow okay so I've got my mom like that's just over a teaspoon just gonna push that straight in there like that I think in Australia you call that guys a Vegemite Marmite out on that but it's ER anyway stir it through simmer it and it should start to thicken now baby my friends it's been five minutes the gravy is simmering away oh it is hot in here but it's cold outside because that's a good thing right check out the gravy look I'll give it a little stir you can see the onions and the leeks rise into the top that is the texture I'm after I want it not too thick not too thin if you want it thicker maybe add less water maybe some flour it's up to you one thing I'm gonna add to it right now though is a little bit of safe you can use fresh sage leaves if you like I'm just gonna pour this into out the tub give it a little stir around give it a nice little funky boost wash clean that goes like that our sausages are cooking away good thing cook them like that I can just keep turning them get them really nice and dark and funky it's like a slow cooker approach the potatoes I've just sliced in half there already I've checked them so we're ready to mushroom and we can bring this together right home folks you can probably see here by drying salad bowl and I put our potatoes in it you can see as well that the skin that just wants to peel it off about this so a mash up all that skin is gonna break down let's make some funky mash okay so using the heat if the potatoes ever gonna chuck in a block of butter like so pour in a hundred mils of single cream you can use milk a heaped teaspoon of whole grain mustard shocked wrong and that goes and just another teaspoon of sage in there so just sprinkle that in and then we get the mash it here we go so I'm just breaking it down merging all of these ingredients together you can see how the skin is just falling off you want all these flavors to merge make sure that butter gets all in there oh my goodness looking good it's kind of fun okay guys after mash it together Wow looks like a mouth hello iris after I'm actually looking whole grain mash boom I'm gonna get the sausage off the gravy it's simmering away let me just show you chittering we're gonna show you over here wow that is ready to go I may be it and I'm very hot right now okay so to serve it all we've got to do is grab yourself a cool plate like that get yourself a nice big dollop of our mashed potatoes like that in fact if you feed him flat what you could do is pipe it on we'd like one of these cake things now I'm gonna share our sauces in you can oh you can stab them in like horns like that you rest them on top arrest them on top like they're lying down on the sunbed baby okay so this gonna go for two for the minute let's push this one in in fact I should actually call it a banger but let's get our gravy and just pour it all over top let's just drench it yeah right here we go then nice big spoonful just completely cover it oh my goodness look at that the leek and the onion sat on there hanging out oh wow I cannot wait to taste this okay folks I have got the perfect thoughtful here sausage gravy and potato I'm gonna shove it down my mouth now smells so good at the mind is for ages and that yeah this is good we're sorry none quite that way that's amazing we don't even do anything those sausages all the flavor is from the potatoes and the gravy is just going boom I'm getting the gravy one side potatoes over and the sausage straight down the middle and that sounds rude but that my friends is amazing it took me half an hour to make that in total so if I wasn't filming it maybe a little less and we don't have to go so flashy to put your own twist on it yeah if I can make it absolutely anyone in the world can happier yourself let me know how you on and I'll see you again next time hi guys how's it going welcome to my virgin

here we go we've got the leeks and the onions in there they're just playing around and they're just spoon doing a guy's in the embedded start a break down already there's anything about three minutes well just give it okay so the banging noise I was talking out out talking about okay so we're gonna add some sort of non women okay so we got add a little bit of funny games to our leeks and onions
