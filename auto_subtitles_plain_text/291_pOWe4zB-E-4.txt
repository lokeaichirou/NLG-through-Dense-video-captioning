 today we are going to cook one the most like this that is masala rava dosa it is very simple for making masala rava dosa we need to take Camela or all-purpose flour just take any amount I am taking this to small bowel and then mix equal amount of rice flour in the matter another 2 small bowel of rice flour in it and we also because he's rava dosa so we need to mix Sugie Sugie will also be in the equal proportion as we have mix the rice flour and mega and in this add few curry leaves if you have good fresh curry leaves there's even better I had salt to your taste and I am going to add around 1 tbsp cumin seeds and add pinch of Fahim do not add too much in because it's true strong and it might make those are bitter if it is too much just mix all these things to dry together and then we start adding water thrown at too much water in one cook just make a dough short on dough we can also add chopped ginger if you want you can have it in the paste and add green chopped finely chopped green chilies in fact use a chopping board because sometimes difficult to chop the green chilli like I am doing and mix all these things together and add more water if we need to once we have this kind of dough just leave it for around 2 hours and after 2 hours in the dough add more black pepper to it I'm going to add in created coconut is Austin you don't need to add coconut if you don't want oh I'm just adding little amount of coconut and just mix these things together and just to make it more flavorful I will add little amount of milk around 50 gram it is also optional you can make this makes more water and make a very light though this too will be very thin because we will spread it over our tower as you can see is a very thin dough and now we will start making our rub our dosa or masala rava dosa for this heat of a pan and add oil and just spread the oil over the pan and then just spread this dough that we have made all the water Lee solution of all the innovation this is spread over the tawa I am just trying to fill all the gaps in the dosa you don't need to infect and then you apply little amount of oil on the edges it will help in taking this rava dosa out of from the tawa as you can see that we can just turn it around and cook from the other side as well this creative it because my tomatoes a little thicker than what we get in the market well that's what the practice called they have lots of practice and then we are going to apply this potato that we have made in other video just put them in the middle of the dosa just turn the dosa around once more and our rawa masala dosa is ready and we are going to enjoy this way the summer that we have made in other video
