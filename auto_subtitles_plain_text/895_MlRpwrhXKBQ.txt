 [Music] hi this is tony from cookingaround today we're going to make buffalo chicken wings my way I will show you how to prepare the chicken wings and then I'm going to show you how to make a nice fast fast super fast sauce to go with it first of all I have a bowl here of one kilo of chicken wings so we take one chicken wings and you notice that the chicken wings here is basically in three pieces the drum the center and the tip you've got other things for it but that's what they're called now we're going to cut it right about here and release this drum part the tip some people like to remove it I don't that's my favorite part once it's done so what we do is we take this chicken wing and we just cut right down the center here and it comes right off and there we go now I'm gonna prepare the rest now I have cut up the chicken into various pieces that we're going to use and at the same time it's already washed now what I have to do is dry it so we take that and we draw it very very very good very very well really nice and dry so here's our chicken wings and now what we do is we take a little bit of oil well this they use oil which is definitely well you know basically is what you want and just take that now policy is the best thing now we are going to app at less than about half a cup of white flour because I don't have that many chicken wings here and of course famous soft you're probably asking why does this guy always lose this little tiny bag well it's a long story my girlfriend promised to buy me this specialty to hold a soulful cooking and it's not here yet so until it because this is what I'm going to use too much of course the famous top it off I have some chicken seasoning here which has some cayenne pepper in here and some of the little goodies you can just use cayenne pepper or don't even put it at all I just put cos some people may not want to have it with the hot sauce so they can just have it with this and then just be more models okay now we're gonna do is we're gonna transfer this into a bag make sure the bank has no hole use you can use a garbage bag using basically pepper bag as long as it's clean there's nothing inside so now take the bag and I already checked to make sure there's no holes and I just dumped the whole thing inside that air those air pockets in there to turn around does another work but when I go to take it off because you don't do that sometimes it comes right out through the opening we do the background not rocket science Oh chicken up nice nice even cold there we are now over here take the bag now you rip the bag drop it in perfectly [Music] she said no okay have a plug in for well I have a big be about an inch in happen to it just well you don't need anymore I have to do this in two batches though for the amount that have one cable now how do we know that the oil is ready what you do just take one of the chicken wings hold on your finger and just put them in and don't see all the bubbles going there that means it's perfect amateur now we don't want the temperature very very high because we do not want the outside to be cooked very very fast and the inside it is still not cooked properly so make sure that your heat is more or less than medium at this point and all you do know is just grab your chicken and just very carefully very carefully from inside and here we are and air box and basically I like mine a little bit more persons in their role in water temperature so you've got a bowl you with bigger balls and very carefully just now what I do from here is after I dried them with the paper I put them on a rack to dry further that way they don't become soggy and they hold themselves very crispy okay so here's our delicious chicken wings and welcome back we don't know if we can make a sauce for our buffalo chicken wings they're flying there right now on the side grab yourself about half a cup of butter we don't want it to burn so make sure that he goes no whoa now we add a little bit less of one third of ketchup yes ketchup makes your life a lot easier if it's a multi-billion dollar corporation well it must be good [Music] there and now there's also a sauce my tomato paste which you can find on my other video but if you don't want to use that and basically use any type of putt sauce that you want but I think my own so if I working about what a quarter of a cup you can add more if you really what you want to talk but I guess may not like it that talk so I just put in less than a quarter cup and now we add a little bit of salt just the pitch and now this secret two tablespoons of honey if you want the brown sugar if you want instead I like honey it's more natural and you just stir that around and there is that delicious delicious pot not too thick not be back and that basically none notice here that we have the chicken weeks I didn't put no sauce on it just came out of the fryer like that and dipping sauce so again we have to do to taste this now I can only eat one because my guests are coming but I really don't want to you know spoil it too for them just like that sauce is absolutely perfect and here's a taste test that is really really good sugar no sugar a cup of it I don't think so here's my white toast everybody out there please don't forget to have me subscribe and remember what I always say good wine good food and good friends makes
