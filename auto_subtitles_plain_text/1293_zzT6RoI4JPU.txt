 enjoy today recipe I do not forget subscribe us let's cook it hi here is mum kitchen and welcome with makeup on Hills you know a little bit last days I didn't pay too much attention to my channel because I am very deeply in writing in your recipe book which one is taking most of my time but between the requests and her actions and the videos was one very special and the reckless force from California how to make the real rock goulash to tell you honestly - I am not sure if is it really dragalge about the Czech type of collage or let's say my own goulash because mr. ghoulash is it like with many other special recipes when you have like by tiramisu for example you have wanted a muscle in each family is different this is same with the goulash so let's follow Micah's gosh what do we need of course beef and those little pieces cubes and equally to the beef we need onion then we need pepper paprika salt cumin garlic flour tomato puree butter and you will see I will go for the to the garden for my children fresh marjoram later now we will of course cut the onion it's a maybe look a bit surprising but you need love onion so for the food which one you need for the onion because you need to make quiet very brownish first onion before meat and other things you can use of course pork fat speck oil whatever you like it not olive oil because this is nothing common in our country now we will heat up the oil so we have the Khatami on which one we are giving in the hot oil but is now roasting up to will be really quiet dark colored you will see and don't be afraid of that because most women are making this kind of mistake that they have only the glass effect on the onion but this is not right because this is the face to the brown color so we are cleaning up the the garlic just to mash it and don't make big sorry Kiwis yeah Saavik Amin but you don't need to be really so perfect do you want to know how looks like the first client for the goulash yes para between the time I was already preparing the Connecticut this is this because this is the classic side dish there is goulash but you can use it pacify you can use it potato some someone like rice and I need to tell you I love fresh fried bread for example communicate you have already in our that you will find between the videos okay this is the bet in nature because this is not ready but I want to show you most of the women are stopping in this point no no propel this is still time to go and look at the beautiful Connecticut in the water really nice so be patient with onion and this moment we will put the garlic inside why not early because garlic is very fast burn and if it's burned is like Peter like have already know my space it's actually very beautiful help so now we are giving insider to me we are all singing it yet all season because the roads that need another player which one is necessary to beat my gosh you cannot rush you need to do it with they first a little bit cumin women is the spice which one it happened to you to digest of course so it's different and still no water because we have still enough juice inside and again roasting roasting and roasting now one is out the water from the meat we are giving the tomato period and we are still not giving any gram of water still roasting yeah it's actually up to you if you want to have more spices a sharp one you put the red pepper or chili or whatever or you have sweet red pepper powder or you have already sharp sharp one so it's really up to you and with the tomato puree is also up to you you can give it less or even more it's up to you but we have still without water because we are getting all the water out it's again roasting caramelizing and it's all giving the raw right real flavor of the garage you see you see the bottom of the box this is the right nice sink nice flavor which one we need now I'm using overseas workers now we will softly cook up to the meat it's really nice so another thing what I wanted to show you we do you see it sauce is merely thick and we needed because this is made by the onion and stuff okay and my goulash is also on me so goulash is getting be nearly ready we just need to have a little bit thicker sauce so I have the butter which one is nicely heated up and I love this kind of gold flavor on the butter because is really giving smell beautiful smell of the battle and also you need to have it a little bit darker the causes for the goulash that mean we don't need her blood but we need ground and it's of course also because of the taste is better if you make it a few a little bit roast the flour process get to give some part of tasty it's like in the time of my grandmother she was always using the butter she was always using nicely-nicely the flour in and actually when I was small I love to eat it when was cold because she had always in one pot always like the reserve which one we called ishka yeah this is exactly what we need the meat or better the goulash you are cook cooking so long time how hard to be if you have because of course need to be soft meat and now when we put the flour inside we need about plus minus ten minutes more as I talk to you we need matron and I'm using the fresh one from garden this is the last touch so do you like it look at the garage how looks really beautiful and the Connecticut successful as well and as you see you can put over the fresh no neon you can roll put all roasted on my own you can actually make the core as you wish this is very classic and special for the man and special is the beer okay don't forget cook it
