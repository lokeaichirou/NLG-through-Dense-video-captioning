 Oh hi guys Laura Vitale and today / my husband jose request i'm going to share with you my recipe for his favorite mashed potatoes in the world these are my red skin mashed potatoes full of chives buttery cheesy goodness they are perfect for this time of year a real hearty side dish and really the most incredible mashed potato you can serve at your holiday table they're full of flavor and i just absolutely love them we're going to start i'm just going to share it with you right now show you the potatoes these are some small little little baby red skin potatoes you can use the bigger ones if you want and you just have to cut them smaller but the point is you want these little red skin potatoes the skins really nice and thin so therefore when you mash them together you can leave the skin in there now if you don't want to leave the skin and by all means peel your potatoes it's completely fine either way they're going to be delicious now what i want you to do is scrub them really really well because you're gonna eat the skin so you want to make sure that that's taken care of and you want to have a big pan with water ready now the pot is not turned on yet i didn't turn the water on yet because one of the biggest mistakes people make is when they cook potatoes to make mashed potatoes or to make any kind of potato dish is they took take the potatoes and they put them in boiling water what that's doing is cooking the outside and the insides not cooked yet so it's just got it really I'm even cooking temperature it's so it's not going to be the best result but you always want to make sure you start with cold water and then when you add everything together you turn it on and you cook them so I'm going to do is to my potatoes and I'm just going to quarter them because again these are just going to cook in no time now to the potatoes are just a little bit bigger I'm going to cut them a little smaller I'm going to cut them a little bit more because what you want to make sure is that all of your potatoes are about the same size so they cook evenly there's nothing worse than when you have one potato that's perfectly cooked and another piece that's raw so you want to just take the extra time and again I'm cutting the big ones into about 6 pieces and then the smaller one like this one's really small so I'm just going to cut it half because you can see this half and then one week on three pieces it's pretty much the same size so you want to make sure that you keep that in mind any time you're cooking potatoes or any vegetable really because you want them to cook evenly the last of the potatoes now before you turn the water on you want to make sure that you salt your cooking water because like you do with pasta this is the only chance you're going to get to cook to actually season the potatoes themselves before you go ahead and season your final dish it's super super important like if you've ever boiled potatoes with no salt in the water it tastes bland they don't have very much flavor to them same thing with pasta if you cook boil if you boil pasta in plain water with no salt they really taste like nothing so it makes a huge difference all I'm going to do is bring this to a boil kind of take the heat down to about a simmer or so it's going to cook for about 20 minutes or in total or fork-tender which is really important you don't want this to be at all a dental you want these to be really really soft and tender to get that perfect mashed potato consistency and when they aren't there we will move on to the next step my potatoes cooked in boiling water for about 25 minutes would make sure - really really soft and then all I did I dream them and I put them back into the same pops that is the trick and I have the heat on low and I'm just going to use my potato masher to mash this up and over here what I have is some unsalted butter and some cream cheese that are at room temperature along with some chopped chives some whole milk that I just warmed up in the microwave and some good-quality prime in general and of course I'm gonna have to season this with salt and pepper to taste all I'm doing is I'm just mashing this up with my potato masher and now I'm going to take my knife and little by little I'm going to add some butter and cream cheese and just mix them together as I mash them with the heat on low until you have the cream cheese and the butter all combined my cream cheese and my butter are mixed in there really well so now I'm going to do I still have the heat on low I'm gonna grit in a good amount of parmesan oh you know me you know I like it so I'm gonna probably put in about good three-quarters of a cup or so but you know you can add as much or as little as you want if you don't want to add any by all means leave it out but I mean I don't know why you to go ahead and create a really good amount looks good and I'm going to add in my chopped chives that give it a really good sort of fresh not really an onion bite but just a little something that Lyman's this up a little bit because it is really really rich plenty of black pepper and salt make sure that you season this well because potatoes love love salt and even though we did boil them in the salted water you want to make sure you season as well and then just add a little bit of milk at a time and just stop until you reach your desired consistency of your mashed potatoes and that is it this is looking perfect for me I used about 3/4 of a cup of whole milk it's creamy I can smell the cheese it's going to be divine I'm just going to give myself a little taste because I do have people coming over for dinner but I hardly could resist mashed potatoes ever mmm really hot but there's a reason why this is my husband Joe's favorite mashed potato and I think if you do give them a try you'll understand why they're sweet yet they're buttery and they're cheesy and they've got that sort of bright onion from the chives and I like that they're chunky from the skins that we left on there to get the recipe of course broiler in the kitchen calm I hope I mean Joe's many time with me and as always I will see you in the next one bye bye and when they aren't there we will move on to the next step yeah mashed potato TAC much particular time like a turkey any island we got an early Thanksgiving dinner and we are so excited and I got cranberry sauce in the fridge
