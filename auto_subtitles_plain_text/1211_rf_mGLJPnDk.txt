 hello welcome to New York Oh King if you've watched my previous videos I've prepared pickled green chili barbecue pop which is also known as chassis oh and also won ton soup and the next video the next recipe has to come this is one kind of those so we have two different kinds of wonton noodles in Malaysia one is a dry version and the other is the supervision so the soup version is basically wonton soup and you just add the noodles into the soup and as for the dry version I am going to show you how to prepare this and assemble everything together with your chest you pick a green chili and of course the one ton because we don't want and it will not be one ton noodles so let's get started and look at the ingredients to provide a source of the nurse will need these ingredients so I have a bit of salt and sugar just for taste and then two cloves of garlic which I've just chopped roughly and two tablespoons of oil two tablespoons of dark soy sauce 1 teaspoon of light soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of ketchup - and also one teaspoon of sesame oil so those are the ingredients for the sauce and as for the notice I've spit some egg noodles and these are fresh so I found this at the Asian market and it's not always that we get this kind of noodles this is freshly made and they cannot be kept for so many days to add some greenery to your noodles using choice them and they are always two little yellow flowers of it so those are the one that you're looking for of course you can also replace it with a very tough try if you want but for this dish usually we use choice them we will first work with the garlic first and this is where we are going to prepare the garlic oil so pour the oil into the hot wok and then add the garlic in all we want is just all infused with garlic so using the same wok do not need to clean it I am just going to add water and this is supposed to boil this is where we are going to add the vegetables in so just add in the stems because they take longer to cook 20 seconds later you can add the vegetables to put everything in vegetables do not take long to cook so we just need to just blanch them with hot water and as you see now the color has changed a little a slightly darker green the next step that we are going to do is to click the noodles so while this is cooking for two minutes I'm just going to add all the topsoil sauce soy sauce some sesame oil in Chapman is one tablespoon of water because all the sauces are slightly tip so you won't want everything to be watery and that's why the added costs water and some salt and sugar so put the sauce on low heat early we prepared some garlic oil pour the garlic oil in it you wouldn't want garlic pieces just the oil and then give it a good stir this is we're just going to add the noodles in it it goes onto the plate again this time is when we assemble everything after setting your vegetables you would have caused me to have your chassis on top of it one time noodles will not be complete without one and so when we have one turn you loose in Malaysia we must have pickled green chili this is the one can notice that you can get in Malaysia we call it the dry winter noodles is exceptionally delicious now I hope that you enjoyed this video remember to subscribe to my channel if you have not you want to watch more recipes like this I will show you in the next few videos so remember to also share it with your friends and family give me a thumbs up if you liked this recipe write me your comments in the comment section below also on Twitter Facebook I love to get from here to there happy cooking 200 your visa and
