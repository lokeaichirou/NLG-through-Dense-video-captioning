 welcome back once again to how to cook great food calm if you haven't already please subscribe to our Channel ok some falafel on the menu today these are absolutely wonderful I'm really pleased with how these have come out they're really nice and light and fluffy that's the delicious let's go and do it okay so let's get started on this version of a falafel hope you said that there are many many different ways of making it lots of you put different bits and pieces in this is our version I've got some garlic there for the amount of somebody's about 400 grams 500 grams of cooked chickpeas but I've got about 2 or 3 cloves in there but just it how you want I'm putting in some red onion some people use white I'm using the red and then here I've got a whole load of this is a mix actually this is coriander and parsley you can put one in or you can do I've done a put both in I'm then going to add just a little splash of olive oil to help it's on its way we're going to blend this together then I'll be back okay so as you can see that's been mixed nicely I'm now going to go in with my chickpeas which is nicely cooked grab some salt some black pepper cumin powder for this amount I've got like two two teaspoons and two teaspoons of coriander powder and then I'm going to add some chili you could have a fresh chili if you want I'm adding a chili powder which should be powder and then it'll be fairly hot these ones that's about a teaspoon and then they get an optional throwning some sesame seeds now we need to add just a little bit of baking powder and just sort of help them on their way when they're cooking some people put flour in now I'm not using flour today some people use baking soda entirely up to you I'm going to add a little more splash of oil again a lot of people don't put in the oil and they might have a little water we don't want it to be too wet I mean we're not making vomited because we're going to make these into shapes and then fry them off once again whizz it up see in a moment so you can see now I've got this kind of consistency a little bit wet we've certainly go on it any wetter than this but it's drying up to us the mold into the shapes we won so that I'm really happy with that now of course then if you're watching the add more chili got more cumin add more just get it how you want it it's it there's no real big rule here cumin coriander pretty important in this fastly pretty important but just play around give it just just how you want it but this is not there's no rule but let's go and get this into some shapes and then we're start cooking them okay so as you can see where I've done the up to small do these into some different shapes these are the kind of small balls nice for snacks these are more your pate for your burger they go nice inside you know your pizza bread or your covers with your salad if you're going to eat them like that and that's just a variant little sausage type thing more than how you exactly how you want the next thing to do is get some nice hot oil I'm going to deep-fry mine slightly unhealthy but that's how it's done traditionally you can bake these now if you want you can put that straight in the oven on it it's on a metal dish and they will cook or you can sort your shallow fry them I'm going for the deep fried sorry about that let's go and do that okay so I put my oily I'm using a sunflower oil things anywhere you like as you can see I've just dropped a little bit in so see if the oil was right I think it is now the tricky part this is a fairly delicate we're gonna drop them in now you don't want your oil to be raging raging hot it's not just really burn really quickly so I've got a medium medium bottle there as you can see then they go and these are just going to take about two or three minutes there's no need to touch them at this stage let them just do their thing let's get this other one in there just make sure they're not touching each other now because they might stick a little bit little shake and yeah I'll be back in a couple of minutes okay these look about ready I'm going to fish them out and I'm putting them on some kitchen towel yeah beautiful color I want to put some more than that yeah quite happy with these so let me just cook those other two I've got two guards once I showed you earlier kind of further looking one and then these I mean yeah lovely lovely color he's going to be ready to eat see you the moment okay so there we go as you can see then nothing crispy I've got one here that was broken open nice and moist and beautiful inside we play the perfect for me I'm serving this with some bread and some tying that or tying me which is a sesame seed paste hope you enjoy these they're really to make like I say you can bake them you can shallow fry them or do I done deep-fry them see you again soon bye I forgot to mention that and I just made this small amount but the amount that we made in the mixer it's enough to make make another 20 more of these fellows just place you there I'm going to find out later see
