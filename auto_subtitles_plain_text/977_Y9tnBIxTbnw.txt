 cookie I can have style today we're in my kitchen because we're going to cook and we're going to cook one of my favorite Korean dishes picking up pipi means mix but means rice so basically it's a mixed rice dish where you have a bowl of rice with the different types of vegetables around and some kind of protein like beef or chicken or egg for a vegetarian option and today we're going to make it my way because we're going to make her a pizza with a Moroccan twist so let's start first we're going to prepare all our ingredients little by little so there are some kind of preparation but don't worry it's very easy here I have a carrot so just peel your carrot nothing hard so far so culture the carrot and then cut it in a julienne style so just still a slice it if the carrot is big slice it again so you have thinner sticks like that now we're going to do the same thing for the zucchini so have a Sakina here at the bottom and the tip and then cutting it half quarter it and thinly slice you can keep them like this or just put them together and cut them in half again we're also going to use mushrooms I'm using some sort of trumpet mushrooms you can use shiitake mushrooms or regular white mushrooms and again we're going to thinly slice them we're not done with the vegetables yet I have a fresh spinach and a half bean sprout so as you can see is really healthy pick the vegetables you like and now I'm going to show you how to cook them it's super easy for the spinach boil some water in a saucepan and then just put the spinach in for like around 1 minute after 1 minute remove the spinach from the boiling water and put it in cold water that also has ice so you have an ice cube here that will make the spinach stay green and crisp and we want that so keep it here for 2 minutes and then we're going to remove it while this finish is cooling down and a pinch of salt a large pinch of salt in the boiling water and add the bean sprouts to it so we're going to boil them for around 15 minutes back to the spinach just take it from the cold water and give it a good squeeze and that's it it's ready I'm going to sautee the zucchini carrot and mushroom using the Moroccan charmoula spices and that's the Moroccan twist here I have some cumin paprika hot chili pepper spicy and some salt and a little bit of crushed garlic and we're going to do this with olive oil super easy so first mix all the spices here so you just have to add a pinch of this mixture in a flat pan drizzle a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of crushed garlic and a little bit of our spice mixture this is to heat up the spices of all the flavors colors and now we're going to saute the vegetables separately so first I'm going to start with the zucchini and I'm just going to saute for like 45 seconds okay remove the zucchini put it in a plate and we're going to do the same thing for the carrots so a little bit of olive oil garlic a little bit of spices and and we're going to just saute them for like a minute remove the carrots here oh all crispy mmm again we're going to do the same thing for the mushroom so tell them again for like one minute it should be fun for my protein I'm using shrimp so I just cleaned a little bit the pan I put olive oil and my peeled fresh shrimp here I'm going to use a little bit of lemon juice like a fresh squid and I'm not going to add the shahrullah spices on the shrimp because I think the other vegetables are already flavorful so just a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper there's my pepper and that's it then the dish will get the Sharmila crisis from the vegetables shrimp cook pretty fast so as soon as it turns like opak and pink it's ready so remove it from the juices and just keep the shrimp one more thing for the spinach just give it a little shot you don't want these they're too hard to eat but chop the rest as you can see it's a very easy recipe and here I have all my ingredients and they're all super healthy and now I'm going to show you how to put the people back together first we're going to put cooked rice here so for cooked rice I mean you can use any kind of rice you want white rice brown rice you can use a rice cooker or it's 1 cup of rice 2 cups of water a little bit of salt a little bit of olive oil you close it and you cook it for 20 minutes I'll be fine now I'm going to display the vegetables nicely around the rice so first I'll put some carrots here and zucchini some bean sprouts and of course remove them from the water once they finish boiling I have the mushrooms also young you can see all these beautiful colors and different textures I love this dish we have this spinach here a little bit of green and finally the protein and you put the protein in the center energy finish the Moroccan touch I'm going to sprinkle it with a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro yon and give a little bit of color and center just works with Sharmila spices so this is perfect and that's it here is my TV back with a Moroccan twist you can serve it hot or cold so you can prepare the vegetables beforehand and just serve em at the end all right after you cook them like I showed you also be careful with the salt there are a couple of things that I didn't salt like the spinach and the best press is because I added a little extra salt in the shrimp so I know when you mix it up if all the flavors of burst will be mixed together so the spices you have to be careful about that when you're using different types of ocean of them different tons of cooking and that's it look how pretty it is and now we're going to mix this empty just mix all the stuff here together with the rice yummy so the thing is in Korea they serve it with Korean hot sauce which is like a red hot sauce red pepper hot sauce um it's too spicy for me sometimes I like it like this however you can replace the Korean hot sauce with harissa yes it would be perfect now that's real fusion so you mix mix mix using chopsticks here mm-hmm you just yeah take a little spinach with a little here Wow I could feel camellia and Morocco both punching out in my mouth young is delicious mmm I love you delicious I hope you enjoyed and benefited see you next time
