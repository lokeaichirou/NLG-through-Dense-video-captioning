 [Music] Aslam o alaikum and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan I'm British it's Friday I demand fish and chips and I have two choices either I can cook this processed or I can make my own first thing I'm going to do is prepare me chips so I've taken 500 grams of potatoes have peeled them and cut them into 1 centimeter parallelepipeds have the chips into a pan of boiling water and let them blanch for 2 minutes after 2 minutes drain [Music] refresh with cold water filtering again then allow you to drain in a colander for five minutes now fryer chips at 150 degrees for three minutes remove from the oil and allow to drain while the chips are draining I'll make the batter for the fish and I've sipped 75 grams or half a cup of plain flour and four tablespoons of corn flour or cornstarch into a bowl I'm going to add in two teaspoons of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt and you can add in whatever else you want into your batter I'm adding for example half a teaspoon each of ground black pepper paprika and garlic powder now I need some liquid as well so I'm going to add in half a cup 125 mils of fizzy water why fizzy water because it'll add some bubbles into the batter and I want my batter to be nice and light now I'll risk it with my hand whisk [Music] lovely I've got a nice creamy smooth batter I've got a couple of lovely pieces of fish here this is cod but you could use hey Corp anger or halibut or whatever you want really I've washed them under the tap I'm just gonna add them into the batter push them well down make sure they're really well covered and just leave them until you're ready to cook them fry the chips at 180 degrees C for 8 to 10 minutes when golden remove from the fryer and drain to cook the fish you need the oil really hot so this is now a 200 degrees centigrade I've removed the chip basket and I'm just going to lower in the fish very slowly to make sure that the batter cooks as I'm lowering the fishing after about five minutes the fish is a lovely black and brown color so I'll put it down some cookies on a plate with some kitchen roll again succulent juicy cording crispy butter with homemade chips made in France by Ross bethis every Friday hundreds of thousands of experts around the world are denied their basic right to fish and chips the titli nihaan international fish and chip relief fund for British experts aims to help them please give generously and join me next time in titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan until then hora Hafiz [Music]
