 hi I'm tiny is still from Epicurus calm and you're watching around the world in 80 dishes today we're going to Italy to Tuscany Italy actually to make pasta fazool my friend chef de Perry I said yeah going on I am very excited about this dish because this is kind of a classic home dish that they eat while in Tuscany particularly but really all over Italy is like all over all over there's nothing better than pork and beans so true that's what this dish is pretty much all about good yeah so here we go how about this we're gonna start first with some Italian sausage you choose which one do you like hotter sweet I'm gonna go with a sweet okay yeah so we have some sweet just like me right just like you not hot but sweet then you're gonna cook this until it's brown so it's nice and brown and you probably wanna tell it along with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil so you can see how nice and again we don't want it to burn so moderate a high heat okay so you see how very quickly we browned it off yep so next let's throw in some onions okay so we want to cook these onions until they start to turn a little bit more on the translucent side okay yeah doesn't that look nice yeah our next ingredient is going to be the beans wow that's a lot of being soon well this is a really heart it's a very hearty soup now as far as Olli is that beam but your lays beans when my father got upset at us because we weren't using common sense he would call us a fazool now here's the magic Oh Riggs a Rose Marie okay and you put beef broth is that correct yes okay now some people like to put garlic in in this soup and they would put it in after the onions are fried uh-huh some people don't want to have the extra garlic in there but there's a way to incorporate the garlic into the soup without actually having to eat it now that's just to peel a couple of cloves and just set them in and then later you can get them out I see okay so the cloves are actually just boiling okay so you bring this soup to it he's gonna bring it up to a simmer okay you may have to season it with a little salt and pepper how's it smell it smells great doesn't it I can some other rows we take yeah now the last thing we want to do is let this thing to come to a boil because we don't want the beans to break apart I think we should taste it before we played it what do you know because if we need a little bit more seasoning we want to put that seasoning in before we plate oh my god that's awesome hmm oh my god you know it's a sausage flavor is intense it's delicious what we're going to do is we are going to put our pasta in the bowl right and then we're gonna pour ladle it right on top okay and so that that warms up the pasta well this as you can see it's probably a good 210 degrees here so I'm sure that this hot soup with really isn't going to this isn't going to cool this down that much mm-hmm oh wow that's beautiful so you're not putting the rosemary in no and we want to mix it up now is this one of those things that's even better the next day it's way better the next day look at that how do you think beautiful now we could finish this with some fresh chopped parsley or some fresh chopped rosemary do you mind if I just taste for the boom is that okay it's very telling you know me right absolute digging that's what they say right mind your kids munching mmm oh my gosh I feel great chef Perry thank you so much for showing me how to make this pasta fagioli it was so delicious also thank you so much you're very welcome my pleasure
