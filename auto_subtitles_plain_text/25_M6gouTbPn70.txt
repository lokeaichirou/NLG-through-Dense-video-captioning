 you guys love corn dogs but you hate the bad reputation they have so this is our fancy version now my everlasting memory of a corn dog is standing in Santa Monica beach from getting it from hot dog stand and we got a corn dog for the first time so we thought we've never had it before and loads of people have told us about them and wants to make it and we ate it well it wasn't brilliant it's a hot salty hot dog in a kind of sweet corn batter and that's what we do today but we're gonna give it a spicy twist to go that it haven't got quite socially sweet element to it this is 50/50 polenta and plain flour okay which is pretty standard ratio an egg and then buttermilk behind it it's also got playful powder in there and sort bearing in mind that plenty is cornmeal you know that's where the corn comes from okay but not enough so I think we did a fancy one so we've also got a tin of sweet corn so the sweet corn is going to go into the blender with handful of jalapeno peppers yes lysed Chili Peppers and spring onions so he did smell pretty good actually it's very very simple yeah but that's what's gonna make our basic corndog batter spicy okay so that's gonna go in there this is something good should we go throw something up spicy or sweet and actually those people said spicy yes spicy got the winning vote as did beef in the choice of hot dogs so pork or beef two choices hot dog traditionally I'd have said hot dogs report yep because my expensive hot dog this side of pond would be thanks veggies that's German they take mini pork sausage these are beef waving over next up when you could batter out dogs so we have got all dogs the batter yeah a couple of top tips one or glass full of your choice a glass of your mix right next up you take the dog you want to get all the moisture off your dog so roll it in corn flour yeah and what that would do is double the moisture and help the batter to stick and then push ace wooden skewer down at the center now you've got your gloves full of liquid it's really easy that is a top tip that is a top top tip make sure is completely covered and then into oil at 180 degrees Celsius at three or four minutes there's probably a good time to talk about why the hell they called dogs hot dogs did you know cuz I my dear I had no idea it used to be because in Germany they put dunk me in the sausages was that true or just a rumor just a wave tales Wikipedia true so sure enough I can guarantee you these are beef no dog involved as somebody said the ratio the perfect ratio of porn book should be 8% dog 20% batter and we sort of occasionally just given up a roll in the meantime we can make a dip to go with it because dilution of corn dog might be American mustard ketchup so I like street food it's great for that we missing bit different to play off our sweet corn jalapeno flavors we're gonna make a mayonnaise with lime juice and fresh coriander you can zest the line into there I can indeed I'll chop up and coriander oh I've really enjoyed about this process of doing these these recipes where we've got you guys involved is that you've helped us create them and actually they're better for it because we've got influences from all around the world and what people know is one corn dog is looking from what somebody else knows and we try to incorporate all of that to create the best corn dogs ever hopefully that's exact what these are now but if they're not if you didn't get your feedback in let us know down below how would you have made this even better give that good mixed up these are now there so they can be fished out and onto paper towel just to drain off excess grease mmm then we think that this will be our version of a corn dog but we want to see what you've had have you had something that looks completely different as you've been served up in a different way send us your picture hashtag assorted all dog pop it up on Instagram I'll come up onto the website and we'll get to see what everyone's done but for now these are done they are a spicy corn dogs with coriander and like mayonnaise sorted by something hot now that is a tasty corner tasty corner turn off kickin it has is the most humble data and a nice sweetness extra sweet core not just cornmeal but the losses we caught you can't sit now but looking yours there's not too much better no it's not too thick and this is a result of your requests and you guys have me a shape what I think is the ultimate oh yes oh thank you very much if you've got any more comments keep talking to us put them down below put them on the website for them everywhere and also the recipe is in the link down below as well as make sure we checked out [Music]
