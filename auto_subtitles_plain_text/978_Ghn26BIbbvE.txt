 hey guys discussion monster today I'm going to show you what is that to be what about Joe's favorite food or at least one of them this is incredibly healthy it's quick it's simple and you kind of just push together things you already have miscellaneous vegetables punch on side dishes and proteins whatever kind you want with just some drizzle of gochujang of the red pepper paste and you top it with a sunny-side egg that's all it is it's very delicious and filling and feeds a lot of people and I'll just show you one way I do it but you can definitely make this your own here's my lineup of ingredients I just want to go over them real quick you'll need eggs to slide on sunny-side up on top of your hope you move up I have some deeply fermented kimchi and it's best to use fermented kimchi when you're cooking with it with a smudge of butter to help soften it I'm gonna cook it off and some rendered rendered bacon fat you know how much I love my thinking I'm trying to sneak it in there all the time and I'm going to eyeball this just like me and my mama do you but precise measurements will be found on my blog with squishy Montcalm so I just have a little open container of sesame oil some soy sauce I have some crumbled up seaweed if you can't find crumbled up it's the same you just take a sheet and just crumble yourself in a ziplock bag I have some meat left over you can use whatever is leftover or what's on sale and I'm gonna mix that with the marinade of the pool okay stuff that I made with my mom I have a video on that and it's also gonna be on my blog because I'm eyeballing things I just have a plate of garlic and some green onions and some sesame seeds some shiitake mushrooms I have some burn break and these are found ready to eat already in a package at your Asian market if not you can just find the dried ones and just rehydrate them and then I have my Korean Moo Korean radish and I just put them into little matchsticks like this but in a pinch against any kind of radish would do even a turnip and then I have some soy bean sprouts not mung beans soy bean sprouts and some spinach back there that I'm gonna both just kind of plunge into some hot water and shop in some ice-cold water and basically I'm just gonna blanch them and in details about that what we found on my blog I didn't think you'd be very fun to share that part so it'll be found on my blog and let get started you guys after I blanched both veggies I plunge them in ice cold water just to shock them to retain that vibrant color and to stop the cooking process and what I've done to both the soybean sprouts and the spinach I just squeezed out any excess water you want it to be not sopping wet so there's I'm just add in a little sprinkle of salt pepper and a drizzle of sesame oil some garlic some green onions lots of sesame seeds and then I'm going to mix it you can do this with your hands or you can use some gloves you guys can see that's it and just give this a nice toss together with your hands and you can taste periodically just to see if it needs any more salts or any more seasoning or anything like that so this is pretty much done I'm gonna be the same thing with my spinach swap bowls here my spinach is right here take off my gloves for the wild drizzle in my semi-loyal sprinkling lots of garlic green onions Stephanie feed and literally salt and pepper this is everything I'm going to saute that's all that's really left here I just have my bacon going in this pan then I the my sushi and my butter to it and kind of saute it just so I bloom the flavors and every so after this are all of you using that same pin and it'll help flavor everything else with that smokey bacon spicy kimchi flavor I'm going to glaze the bottom of my pan like this and put it in my most bullion this veggie of all its gonna splatter so be careful my garlic of course if the only garlic is one of those things that makes everything better and then towards the end I'm going to put in like the onions that sprinkle in my sesame seed now and a little tiny drizzle of sesame or soy sauce just a little tiny bit same dealio here glaze the bottom of my pan with the sesame oil and I'm going to put in my cream meat or no not communities are my shiitake mushroom and salts to bring out and drop some of that moisture out pepper because you know all the pension comes up pretty quickly or really ideally you should just have these laying around it's just comprised of leftovers garlic merger mutton whatever must remain maybe in water it's plinkus poison it's a joke everything up to threats that lightly with a wet paper towel or like a wash my next class are my fern breaks and again I'm going to spiders to be very careful kind of break it apart with your spoon a spatula a drizzle in your soy sauce and remember just be mindful that you don't add too too much salt to this because everything has been littered with salt and seasoning and you know the soy sauce is very salty just a little tad bit of salt lots of and then towards the very ends put any more green onions but not before you put in your sesame seeds and since this is already ready to go you just kind of want to heat it through and let the garlic do its thing do it straw by infusing it with that nice garlicky flavor you don't have to cook this like you know until it's mushy so just give it a quick toss and let it go for just a couple of minutes last thing to do is cook off my frugal gear it's sitting us marinade at this point for a good thirty minutes or so here are my plate of goodies I wanted to show you guys before I dug into it my rice is just about steamed and I'm gonna fry up an egg and I'll show you how to make the sauce here is my Korean radish Moo my fern break my shiitake mushrooms my crumbled up roasted seaweed my kimchi flavored with lots of bacon and butter and then we have our spinach our soybean sprouts and up rugal in my bowl here I just have a spoonful of red pepper paste gochujang and then I'm gonna drizzle in my sesame oil sprinkle in my test me feed just a little kiss of sugar just to balance out the spicy net spicy bite of this and give it a nice mix here is my PB Bob I think that mom and dad are really gonna enjoy this for dinner tonight I just laid everything on top to make Butte colors on top of my price and there's my thoughts in a sunny-side egg it's very important to have a sunny-side egg been mixed in with everything and the heat of everything else I kind of continue to cook the egg it's going to be nice and creamy and rich I mean you can make this and personalize this to make your own so have fun with it when other veggies are protein you like or whatever you have playing are out thanks so much for spending time with me this is fish monster and I'll see you guys bye
