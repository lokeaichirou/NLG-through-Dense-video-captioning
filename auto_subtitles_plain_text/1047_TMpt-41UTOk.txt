 [Music] hi Tanya welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to show you how to prepare iake this is a recipe I got from my mom and we're going to be preparing today a pair of easy answer which is yaki with meat and those our favorite of sebastian's and there are so many different types of pierogi they can be done with meat with cabbage with the fruits sweet sour spicy whichever whichever way you want to go you can go with P okey but today let's make Sebastien healthy let's have a look at the ingredients so you know what you mean [Music] I am starting with my need I'm putting it into the large part together with half of the onion my dried mushrooms baby few peppercorns and the teaspoon of salt and then I'm going to add enough water just to cover the meat okay and then on medium medium-high heat I'm going to be cooking it for an hour right this is ready it's time to fish it out so we take our onion the dried mushrooms and the meat out and then we let it cool it a little bit so it doesn't burn our fingers but the stock you want to keep because you might need it later it's pretty fun so I wouldn't use it for anything else but we might need a few tablespoon or half a cup for the stuffing later on okay our milk cook meat cool down a little bit and I'm going to cut it into smaller pieces just so much easier to use the grinder and later here we go through the grinder goes the meat the onion and the dried mushrooms now if you do not have a grinder you can use the food processor for that as well you just you just need to make sure that the meat is very well processed in goes the onions [Music] and the mushrooms and then on my frying pan I have around the tablespoon of oil I'm adding my own urine that's the other half of the onion which I chopped finely and I'm going to be cooking it for 3-4 minutes until it's nice soft and cloth just like that and now we adding our onion to the meat [Music] and then adding some salt and pepper okay and now we start mixing it so first I'm working with my spoon and then I'm switching to my hand I'm going to be working on my meat for around five seven minutes it just needs to get elastic and in my case it was a little bit dry so I added 1/2 a cup of the of the juice again of the stock sorry and then we work it some more and now the best thing is to do the stuffing one day and then the pierogi the other day but you could do it right right now but for me that was evening and I just packed it nicely with the aluminium foil and I put it in the fridge now the next day I started with putting water into my largest pot added a teaspoon of salt and let it bring to a boil and in the meantime into my food processor I'm adding the flour [Music] yes and then teaspoon of salt and then I'm going to process it just a little bit so the salt mixes with the flour here we go with Moses full time yes here we go it's done and then slowly here in the cup I have water which was just boiling it's not boiling hot but it's still very very warm very slowly I'm adding it into my food processor and as you can see when it starts forming a bowl like this I'm checking if it's soft and then you should run it for another minute or so and then it's ready go lightly flour the surface transfer our so an end and now I'm going to need it a few times but it gets elastic and not sticky very quickly okay so now I'm cutting it in half 1/2 I'm putting four later on into a ziploc bag and the other half we're going to be rolling and it's a lot of rolling and flipping the dough so it doesn't stick to the table here we go we wanna roll it pretty thin between one and two millimeters it also depends how you like it you might wanna add a little bit thicker or a little bit thinner for me I like it around two millimeters I don't like it too too thin here we go and then with my class I'm cutting circles and then I'm taking the remaining dough and I'm going to put it add it to the rest of the here we go dough into my foot lock bag just so it doesn't dry out and we can still use it now my my plate I'm sprinkling with the flour because I don't want my pirogue to stick and then I'm putting water on the side just my mom told me gonna in case my PA rocky are getting too dry and they don't wanna close I want to put a little bit of water on the edges I did not have that problem okay so I'm picking up my dough very important the circles you want to flip it over so you're closing it with the sides which was laying on the table you put one tablespoon of the stuffing and then you nicely close it and then at the end I added a little bit of a decoration there here we go so you stretch it out yep then you flip it and then tablespoon of stuffing we squeeze it in kind of we stretch the dough around here we go close it and make a little decoration here we go okay so when we done with all the circles our water is boiling now so gently and carefully so you don't get burned you put all your pirogue inside now do not overcrowd if you don't have the big pot like this just make it in in portions okay with the wooden spoon I'm going to stir it a little bit so they don't stuck to the bottom and then when they float up it means that another minute and they are ready so I spread my serving plate with a nonstick spray to fish out our Pierrot game [Music] off we go [Music] okay and now we want to spray them on top as well with a little bit of a nonstick spray and then there are many ways of serving pierogi but one of them is just to fry them on a little bit of oil that's favorite of Sebastian so that's what I'm doing here but you could just serve them from water with some sour cream you could serve them with some fried onion or with some fried bacon and onion different ways but today we're going to serve them right that's how it looks like I hope guys you enjoy the recipe you please let me know what you think and I will see you next time bye [Music] you
