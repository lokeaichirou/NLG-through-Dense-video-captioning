 along with chapatis naan is the most basic accompaniment to Indian food the shop book version is convenient but tends to be more cake-like than the traditional variety and nothing beats making it yourself so my favor the thing about this it is just so easy to do great so I know you love Naruto have you got some simple flour baking powder uh-huh it's sugar salt salt 1/2 teaspoon okay sugar no your nan is sweeter than it is salt so maybe a half a teaspoon 1/2 yeah okay mix it all together so that is all your dry ingredients I'm making a well and it's just milk and a little bit of oil to keep it soft okay I'm pouring it straight in the middle what I want you to put your hands straight in okay really slowly kind of keep mixing and just move your wrist right keep drawing the flour down from the sides I say you just gradually get a larger soil exactly what you're looking for is a soft dough not sticky right now this is a very forgiving go so say for instance you've put in too much liquid add a bit more flour to dry add a bit liquid so at some stage you can just tip that on to the counter okay and just have a really good need have you needed it bread before I've eaten it I haven't need in it it's just a matter of pushing it away yep and then kind of bringing it back just make it a nice rhythmic action like you're giving a massage to the bread we want the naan nice and soft so it does require kneading about 10 minutes or so let me have a feel that's good this is the only hard work involved and I think it's a really good stress Buster but this sort of thing is it freezable um dough freezes really well actually I mean you could even make up the naan and then freeze it and kind of just warm it through in the oven really I like the way that looks that looks quite good to me nice border so now I just needs to rest I'm just gonna put a bit of oil in the bowl so it doesn't stick right right we've given the dough a fair pounding so now it needs an hour to rest in a warm spot this allows it to rise a little and gives me the chance to melt some butter to spread on top has it increased in volume Paul here's your nun here's your rolling pin uh-huh what is your topping my choice I do like coriander coriander coriander it is how did you get that to actually stay sort of all in place I'm gonna do this ooh I can do that and actually know what I do also like to do sometimes as none is to Crickett uh-huh just sometimes it stops it kind of fluffing up like a pita bread right and that's it that's none well almost now it has to be cooked take your nan and slap it down traditionally this is done using a superheated Thunder oven but that doesn't mean you can't do it at home so as you can see I've been heating up a baking pan yeah and I put the grill on to as hot as it can get I'm basically just leave it and it will cook by itself it takes just like a minute and quick that point you don't really want the whole night to be colored it should be white with lots of lovely brown okay looks very nice lovely done all right should we have a taste test oh yes please oh it's hot though asbestos things as you said right yeah that's it all right mmm very nice and that was so quick to do it yeah very impressed
