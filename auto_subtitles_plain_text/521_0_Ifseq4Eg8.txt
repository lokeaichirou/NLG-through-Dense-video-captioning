 we're going to do a beautiful version of a war dog salad okay this is a classic salad from the ward off Hotel in New York I'm still going to honor and respect the sort of basis of the salad but I want to take you on a bit I want to express myself with roasted grapes that healthy dressing I absolutely love it as a starter as a side salad amazing with a roast chicken and roast potatoes first up the classic part has to be at the grapes so get yourself some lovely grapes so salt and pepper olive oil and a little squeeze of lemon juice so dress it like a little salad the original recipe had beautiful fresh grapes I want to get caramelization sweetness I want to get another vibe going on dress the grapes in that seasoning this is in the wood oven about 190 degrees for about 5 to 10 minutes see how it's starting to just shrivel up and see that little red juice we're now going to go in my nuts back in what I'm gonna do next is celery peel off the worst of the stringy bits so I use a speed peeler to do this normally people hack this end off and throw it in the bin but this is like the crown jewel this is what the Italians go mad for I want to just keep this heart or come back to that we have the stalks here slice them up nice and delicate the heart of the celery is often the part that everyone throws away look how beautiful that is guys and the flavor is crunchy and fresh and really clean finally slice those hearts gorgeous we've got romaine lettuce take the first half because it produces gorgeous little cups then I'm going to finely slice the middle part and then I'm going to cut this part in half just like the celery I'm going to do this for four people don't want to make a nice big salad sorry about the noise it's mating season I'm at home in Essex Springs come the sun's out it's like dr. Dolittle's love pile around here every corner you turn there is an animal at it so the original Waldorf salad dressing was mayonnaise based I'm going to make something with vibe with better flavors more dynamic flavors so a couple of tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil twice as much organic yogurt go a nice teaspoon of English mustard season it with salt and pepper it's quite nice with a little squeeze of lemon juice it's going to be a really nice little dressing the lovely color I can hear this stuff going off in here those grapes on phenomenal look at that tarragon I've got here chopped up the tarragon get it in your dressing mix up that flavor in and on top wonderful we'll take our grapes the vine take some of these nuts as well focusing on my nuts please and then just crush them with your hands there's the animals they're getting excited I'm getting excited it's all kicking off here in Essex tell me in the comments box below where you're from in the world and have a little listen where you are and tell me if there's animals at it I want to see where you're from that's a beautiful thing about YouTube because you guys are watching from all over the world what a lovely community we've built together so thanks for following subscribing don't forget to share it to all your friends because we love it and it's free and that's the whole point more nuts crush it up and then the golden bit this juice it's almost like a natural sort of great balsamic vinegar don't don't waste any of that I've got my nice Apple cut it even thickness I'm just going to slice this up the other way into matchsticks in we go toss it up gorgeous colors wonderful textures so I've saved back couple of these grapes just to put on top a beautiful simple reinterpretation of that great classic salad but with roasted grapes that healthy dressing I mean this isn't all for me obviously this is for four people but you know I'm just gonna hang out and eat my funky little water salad that is really good the roasted grapes gives incredible sweetness and it works so well with the nuts and the tang of the dressing and the crunch of the Apple and the celery that is a mighty seller please please give that a go very exciting if you want more salads then check out DJ BBQ he's done a wicked little Caesar salad and I've trust him to do a good job whoo DJ BBQ good game until next time take care guys bye and from all the animals bye you
