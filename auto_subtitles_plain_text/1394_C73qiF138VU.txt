 hi I'm Ryan D'Agostino I'm the editor of the new cookbook from Esquire magazine eat like a man this is pretty much the only cookbook a man will ever need today I'm going to be making one of the recipes from the book fantastic meatloaf from chef Michael Symon who in addition to being an Iron Chef also runs two of my favorite restaurants in America Lola Bistro and Lolita in Cleveland having this book is like having some of the greatest chefs in the world right here in your kitchen cooking with you so this should be easy good luck well it's a really easy recipe okay dice up a red onion I'm into a few cloves of garlic and chop up some cilantro that we're going to add in later each chef includes some sort of technique or trick with their recipe and as you learn them eventually you build up your skill set and you can cook whatever you want so the next thing we're going to do is saute the onions and garlic and a little bit of butter cook these about five to seven minutes until they're soft and kind of translucent okay so next we're going to let the onions in the garlic cool down now we're going to put everything else in a big bowl and mush it all together you got some nice hot Italian sausage some ground beef we're going to beat two eggs together and add those in and then just some Japanese breadcrumbs and chopped cilantro then we'll add the cooled off onions and garlic a little salt a little pepper so this is the fun part another thing we have in this book is essays with short pieces of writing from Esquire amazing writers that are just meant to sort of inspire you to get in the kitchen and cook when everything is all mixed together and you can't see the bread crumbs anymore you take the whole mixture and you pack it into a meat loaf pan or you can just make it into a shape that looks like a meatloaf and put it on a baking sheet into the oven it goes 375 for 40 minutes right even you couldn't screw it up it's fantastic Diana he's like a man
