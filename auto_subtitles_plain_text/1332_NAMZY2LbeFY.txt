 hi I'm Diane cometa and today I'm dishing with dye I'm making pasta fazool pasta and bean soup this is an easy one pot meal that's perfect for a weeknight so let's get started you need some canned cannellini beans some tomato sauce some ditalini which is a small tube pasta a dried bay leaf some fresh garlic and some chicken broth or chicken stock you're also going to need some celery carrot and onion and I have some fresh herbs here now I have some fresh rosemary and fresh thyme and I actually keep mine in the freezer after I purchase it and I wrap it in some foil and put it in a freezer safe bag so whenever I need it I can just unwrap it and take it out so that's what I did today and another thing I have here is some pancetta this is an Italian bacon and it's diced really small if you don't want to use this you don't have to you can either substitute and use some regular bacon that's that's a little bit more fatty though or you can just leave this out I've left it out plenty of times and it still tastes really good so don't worry about this part of it and I have some salt pepper and olive oil now what we're gonna do first is take the celery carrot and onion and we're gonna actually I'm gonna put mine in my mini food processor here I'm gonna cut it up really small so if you don't have one just cut it up really fine so I have to give it a rough chop first before I put it in there almost forgot you want to put the garlic in there as well so if you're doing it by hand just mince your garlic up really fine now I'm going to go over the stove and we're gonna get this whole thing started I have a pot heating over medium heat and I'm adding some olive oil in and now I'm gonna add in my pancetta and you just want this to cook for a few minutes until the pancetta gets nice and brown okay the pancetta it's nice and brown now and you see all the little brown bits on the bottom that's what you want that's lots of flavor and the pancetta gives it a really nice smoky taste so now what we're gonna do is add in the vegetables and the garlic so just put that in there and we're gonna put our herbs in there as well around their arm the stems like that because we're gonna take those out at the end so you don't want to chop them up or anything like that you just leave them in their hole and then when we're all done we just yank them right back out it steams up a little bit at first there's a carrot if again didn't get chopped up get that out of there okay so this is just gonna cook for a few minutes three minutes until it gets a little soft and it's nice and fragrant it's gonna add a little bit of salt in there and some fresh pepper you just season this to taste and give that a little quick stir around and this is something that I've made plenty of times on a weeknight and I come home from work and I just do it really quick and boom it's done so now we're ready for the next step and I'm gonna add in the chicken broth and then you're also gonna add in your sauce at this point and the beans now just give that a star and then we're gonna raise the heat up to like medium-high and you're gonna bring this up to a boil and believe it or not we're almost done okay it started to boil and now I'm gonna add in the pasta and you're just gonna let this cook for about 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender then we're ready to serve it up that was literally about 30 minutes altogether so what I like to do is I have some nice fresh crusty Italian bread here and I have some fresh Parmesan cheese so I take my Parmesan cheese and I just grate that on the top and now it's time for a little taste oh so hot but it's really good I promise burnt my tongue I think the one thing I want to tell you real quick is that when you're cooking it make sure that you scrape the bottom a little bit because sometimes the beans will sit on the bottom when you're boiling the pasta and you want to make sure that they don't stick down there so just get your spatula or your spoon and just scrape that up real good but really delicious rich and perfect for a weeknight but you can certainly have this any time you want it's a wonderful comfort food and you could use low-sodium chicken broth they have now white pasta that has extra fiber in it or you could use a whole wheat pasta so there's lots of different like healthy options for you here the recipe is on my website dish and with DICOM and don't forget to subscribe I'd love to have you I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable
