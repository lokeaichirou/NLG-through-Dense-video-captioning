 so quick back is a mass recipe I picked out nine potatoes these are Maris paper really good for mashing it's first of all I'm going to peel them and then I cut them up into roughly the same sized chunks so they sort of oily together pop them all into a saucepan you want them fully submerged in water I'm sticking on a nice high heat so I'm using these pork and trivet smoked bacon sausages I'm gonna grill them because I find that a lot easier so just got out some greens to serve with it I'm just using some runner beans iron green beans so once it starts boiling turn it down you want it's over oil so my sausages are halfway cooked I'm just gonna flip them over so I've got the green beans on just testing my potatoes before once they're nice and tender you want to go ahead and drain them so to my mashed potatoes I usually add - tablespoon of butter a good glug of milk tablespoon of Hammond's light and obviously salt and pepper to taste and then I just start mashing sausages are done so I'm going to pull them out so I'm just boiling my kettle and yes I am gonna use gravy granules I just don't have the time moment obviously homemade gravy is the best but this is just a quick and easy meal for tonight and yeah that is literally it is pouring over my gravy you've got any questions let me know
