 I feel like people like to order mussels attic restaurants but they don't usually make them in their home because they're scared of them and they are so easy it's actually think of them like shrimp or you know even clams they are so simple and beautiful so I came up with this recipe because I just love garlic and white wine that quintessential French flavoring this is the perfect sauce for mussels they steam and absorb all those flavors and dipping the bread in is like heaven it is so good I could drink this stuff like soup so once you have your mussels you want to take them out of the fridge and rinse them in water the beard of a mussel is sometimes attached and it basically looks like this scraggly piece of lint or something on the outer shell it's pretty easy to take off but you just have to give it some gusto throw the onion and the garlic in some butter and olive oil and get that going in your pot to release all that yummy fragrant fresh flavoring saute it for a few minutes and then add the wine in along with the mussels discard any mussels that are already open that means that they're not good to cook with it cover the pot and those are gonna steam for just about three to five minutes what I do is I like to buy a big country style loaf the bigger the bread the better for me because I love this sauce I like to cut my bread into big chunks brush it with olive oil on both sides and then grill it for about three minutes per side so it gets that nice char mark on there after the mussels are done I bring them to the table in my big leg hosay and serve them out of that you can easily spoon them on to a big platter or in individual bowls but make sure to give lots of broth to people because that's the best part serve it alongside with the bread for dipping and sprinkle it with fresh parsley and fresh lemon slices it is heaven in a dish
