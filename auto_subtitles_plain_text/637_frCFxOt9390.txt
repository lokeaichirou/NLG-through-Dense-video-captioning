 [Music] all right guys not really a barbecue recipe but it's a ripper so check this out we've got one kilo of diced lamb one coarsely chopped onion four tablespoons of white vinegar and four tablespoons of brown vinegar ten cloves of garlic and an inch of ginger which I've just chopped to you guys now it is common to have the same amount of garlic and ginger in a vindaloo but I like it better this way I've done a bit of experimenting with this here I've got a spice mix now there is a bit going on here so rather than mention all of the ingredients I'll put them down in the description bar for simplicity reasons so just check that out we've got some ghee here of course you can use butter or some olive oil if you want a tablespoon of brown sugar half a tablespoon of salt two teaspoons of paprika and two 400 gram cans of diced tomatoes now we're going to start here by blending up the spice mix now I'm using the spice blender but you can use a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder if you like for this and grind it until it's fine now into a blender I'm going to add all of these ingredients so the garlic and ginger the onions now this is a little bit of an unorthodox way to do it a lot of people will brown the onions off first and don't like that but this way you get all the flavor combined into the sauce and I think of vindaloo is pretty much all about the sauce guys for those vindaloo heads out there you know what I mean so we're just adding in everything other than the lamb [Music] and blend well now if you want to chunkier sauce simply add the tomatoes in later now heat it up a pot over some charcoal I've melted the ghee and just added in that lamb which I'm going to lightly Brown before pouring in that source [Music] and then I put the pot lid on leave it for a few minutes to come up to a simmer [Music] once simmering just give it a light stir replace the lid and move it off the direct heat now this will keep simmering throughout the cooking process without burning the bottom and after an hour or so give it a quick stir [Music] and I'm going to replace the lid on the kettle only this will cook the sauce down and help it reduce and we're going to do that for another half an hour until the sauce is nice and thick this is what we're looking for here guys and that is it you're done serve with some rice guys give this a go it is one of my favorites you've got to check this out thanks for watching and I'll catch you guys next time [Music] you
