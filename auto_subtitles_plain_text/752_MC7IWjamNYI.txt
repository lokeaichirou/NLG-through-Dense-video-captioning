 [Music] hey everybody is rosy and in this video I want to share my recipe for my cheddar garlic mashed potatoes so I'm starting off with my peeled and chopped russet potatoes I have them in a large pot and now I am going to pour in some cool water we want enough water to cover all of our potatoes so now I'm going to bring my water to a boil and we want to boil our potatoes until they are fork tender then we're going to drain our potatoes and set them aside my next step will be melting down 2 to 3 tablespoons of salted butter and I'm going to add in 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic so at this time my heat is on medium and now I'm going to add in all of my potatoes next we're going to mash our potatoes until we can get as many lumps out as possible if you like lumpy mashed potatoes child you are truly different but multiples don't like lumps in our mashed potatoes so we're going to mash them down completely our next step will be adding in half-and-half if you've been using milk your whole life and you don't want to use half-and-half or you don't have half-and-half on hand go ahead and just use regular milk I love the taste of half and half with my mashed potatoes so that's what I'm using and as you can see I'm adding a little bit more I just want to make sure my potatoes are nice and creamy so now I'm going to add in some salt in a little bit of ground black pepper followed by some shredded sharp cheddar so now let's just take a kitchen utensil and we want to make sure everything is nicely folded so we don't just have the cheese on top of the potatoes and once the cheese starts to melt it's going to look nice and delicious and creamy just like this and baby we are ready to serve so tonight I am serving my cheddar garlic mashed potatoes with my turkey meatloaf and I will place a link down below so that you can view that video if you haven't already I'll also be serving my nice creamy cheddar garlic mashed potatoes with some green beans and honey that was completely it this is a family favorite I hope you guys give it a try and I also want to thank you all for watching my video so be sure to check me out at all of these other social media sites because I love hearing from all of you I'm on Facebook Pinterest and Instagram I'm even on Twitter and if you want the complete recipe the measurements and more of my recipes be sure to check me out at I heart recipes com see you all soon you [Music]
