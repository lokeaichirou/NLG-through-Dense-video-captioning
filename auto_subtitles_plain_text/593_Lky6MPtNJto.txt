 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with creamy mushroom braised meat loaf that's right instead of cooking meatloaf and making a mushroom gravy for it i wanted to know what would happen if I did those together and what happened was a pretty delicious lunch so here's what I did I made a meatloaf and I was totally going to show you the recipe for this it's a three meat loaf pork veal and beef but I wasn't completely thrilled on how it came out alright the texture was really good but the taste just wasn't quite what I wanted so anyway I'm gonna keep working on that and show you my three meatloaf at a future date but anyway the rest of this will work with any of our pre-existing meatloaf recipes or whatever is currently your favorite meatloaf recipe ideally one that pairs well with a creamy mushroom sauce so once your meatloaf mixtures together I want you to form it into a loaf that's about six inches across maybe three inches high now you can do this on a sheet pan or in a big wide Bowl like I'm doing it because what you're going to want to be able to do is slide this push this off into our creamy mushroom braising liquid which is actually the topic of this video recipe so how did we make that we're going to take six ounces of shitake mushrooms and as you may know you can't use the stems they're just a little too tough and fibrous so just go ahead and pull those off alright you just want the caps and it's nice of their whole because we're going to slice these up but if a few break don't worry shitake happens alright so slice those up and at that point we're going to head over to the stove where I have a large skillet on medium-high heat with a lot of butter when I see that foamy part of the butter start to turn a little bit tan I will throw in those mushrooms with a big pinch of salt and we're going to cook those until well browned all right so stage one they're just going to kind of get I don't know slimy and they'll just kind of sizzle like that and then if you keep cooking they will dry out a little bit and start to brown nicely like that at that stage I'm going to add a pinch of fresh rosemary alright so give that a stir that just goes a couple seconds and then I'm going to add my flour to this which is going to make yes a roux so we're going to stir in the flour it's going to get all clumpy and kind of dry and no kind of ugly looking that's okay we just want to coat the mushrooms with the flour we're going to just cook that for about three minutes just like that it's not going to look good it's not supposed to don't worry we're just taking the raw edge off the flour at that point you're going to pour in your cold beef broth all right maybe half a cup at a time just pour it in whisk pour it in whisk and because the stock the broth is cold and the roux is hot there's no lumps so stir that in alright we're going to turn the heat up to high bring this up to a simmer and of course because it's a roux as soon as it comes to a simmer it will thicken up we're going to season that with salt and freshly ground black pepper so that's going to come up to a simmer it's going to thicken up and at that point we're going to turn off the heat and stir in our heavy cream okay and that's basically it so now we're exactly at the stage you saw at the beginning of the video when we slid our already formed meatloaf into the skillet so one tip make sure you make this sauce in something that can go into the oven because that's how we're going to cook this now the next time I make this I'm going to put it in the oven like this Brown the top and then baste it with this mushroom sauce here I was so drawn to that sauce it just kept telling me please spoon me over that meatloaf I couldn't resist alright sometimes the urge is just too strong and I gave in and I spoon that sauce over the meatloaf and I put it in the oven and it still was fine but I think I will Brown that first next time alright that went into a low oven 325 degrees for an hour and 30 minutes or until an internal temperature of 155 and at that point it was done and that's looking very rustic you could slice and serve just like that but because that me did cook in that sauce lots of stuff came out from that meat juice fat alright the proteins kind of coagulated underneath so you do have some stuff going on in that sauce so this is something you definitely need to skim the fat off the top I actually skim the fat off the top and boiled the sauce in the pan for about five minutes to thicken it up a little bit but anyway I'm sure you figure out the rest slice meatloaf pour over sauce eat with mashed potatoes I didn't even pretend to have a vegetable side dish with this so my theory here was the meatloaf will flavor the gravy as it roasts as it braises which it did and also cooking the meatloaf on top of the sauce would keep the oven nice and moist and as the meatloaf was flavoring the sauce hopefully the sauce we flavoring the meatloaf alright so how did it taste really good the sauce excellent the texture the moisture of the meatloaf excellent but like I said I wasn't thrilled with the actual meatloaf itself but this technique I think was worthwhile and I do think the meatloaf definitely definitely improved the flavor of the sauce versus just making it separate so anyway the next time you're playing to make meatloaf if you're a fan of mushroom sauces maybe give this technique a try and of course head over to food whooshes calm for all the ingredient amounts as well as more info as usual and as always enjoy
