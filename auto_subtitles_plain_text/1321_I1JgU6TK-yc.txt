 by show of hands who here loves Caesar salad me I love it i order it all the time when i go out to restaurants and do you know sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not so great today i'm making a version that's a little bit lower fat and it's a chicken caesar which is a perennial favorite i think first what you do is you marinate your chicken and you make the base for your dressing so it's sort of a two for one one and a half cups of buttermilk with two tablespoons of lemon juice the chicken can marinate for as little as 15 minutes but you can make this ahead of time if you want to up to a day two tablespoons of lemon juice one clove of garlic today I'm using a garlic press I like the small size that you get with the garlic press here classic Caesar salads are actually made by mashing garlic with anchovies and then whisking in egg yolk and olive oil I'm replacing my egg yolk with mayonnaise and I'm leaving out the anchovy but please feel free to add it in if you want to a quarter cup of grated Parmesan cheese this is cheese is going to go into the marinade but it's also going into the dressing salt and pepper and then reserve a half a cup of this mixture to make your dressing later the rest of it you want for over three skinless boneless chicken breasts about six to eight ounces each seal it up refrigerate it if you're gonna marinate this longer than 15 minutes but if you wanted to do it for as little as 15 you totally cook for the croutons today I'm using a multigrain bread it's a little unorthodox I guess but it's a little bit healthier you certainly could use regular bread if you wanted to like a chewy rustic bread would work as well brush two slices of multigrain bread with olive oil have your broiler preheating these croutons are going to be broiled a little bit of salt and then just broil them until they're golden brown and then you'll cut them up afterwards when you're ready to make your salad take your chicken out of the marinade letting the excess drip back into the bag and then place it on a rimmed baking sheet that's been lined with foil so let the excess liquid drip off but some of its going to end up on the pan and that will get a little extra caramelized / burnt in the oven which is why you want to put it on this rimmed baking sheet with the foil have your broiler preheating and then cook it until your chicken is cooked through to take about 13 to 15 minutes while you're waiting you can make your dressing this is 1/4 cup of light mayonnaise you can use regular mayonnaise if you want to to that add your reserved buttermilk marinade that's why there was the cheese in there Caesar salad always has cheese delicious we're not using all that much but you can be feel free to add more if you want to Caesar salad always has romaine today I'm combining my romaine lettuce with some radicchio though for a little bit of color 2 heads of romaine cut into pieces and a half a head radicchio that's also been shredded you can toss everything together in the bowl that you made your dressing romaine radicchio I told you it wasn't a conventional Caesar salad I will be kidding sort of a cross between Caesar salad and a ranch the buttermilk instead of the mayonnaise base set that aside for a sec cut off your chicken gotten just a little bit of golden brown and those extra brown spots or broiled cheese - adds extra deliciousness these are cooked just until they're cooked through so the chicken isn't dry chicken can go into the salad with your radicchio chicken goes in you want to toss everything together I find that also my salads with the dressings makes for a much better eating experience then drizzling over the top one last thing the croutons cup the bread into whatever size croutons you like say I don't know about an inch toss your croutons into your salad very hearty fantastic serve it up in a nice big bowl it's a hard here kind of healthier hide a lighter version of chicken Caesar salad that I'm sure everybody is gonna love hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this
