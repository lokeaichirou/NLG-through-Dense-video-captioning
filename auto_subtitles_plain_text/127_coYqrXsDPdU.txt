 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with macaroni and cheese the classic thomas jefferson style version so i'm gonna show you the basic steps to make macaroni cheese and then i'm going to show you in the middle of the video how to alter the recipe depending on how cheesy you want this to be alright so all these traditional recipes start with a roux we're going to melt some butter in a saucepan on medium heat and when it sings listen to this do that when the butter sings when you hear it start to foam and bubble you're going to add your flour and it's going to make a very light Roux a very light-colored and light texture grew you're going to cook that on medium for about three or four minutes just to cook out the starch and the flour I'm going to add some thyme some cayenne some white pepper into the roux now why didn't I just add that to the finished cream sauce because I vaguely remember in culinary school there's some spices and herb flavors that are oil soluble and they come out better in oil than just in liquid environment so and I could be you know totally dreaming alright so I'm going to cook that for another minute and then pour in a cup of milk whisk it in really quickly make sure the milk is cold then you won't have lumps hot Roux cold milk no lumps then I might add two more cups of milk and that is going to be your basic white sauce now we're going to bring that up to a simmer on medium heat and while it's coming up to simmer I'm going to grate in some fresh nutmeg get yourself a fresh nut of nutmeg and grate it yourself thousand times better but if you don't put in the cheap powdered stuff I'm going to put a couple drips which is different than drops of Worcestershire sauce and forget about this salt to taste I'm done with salt to taste put in a teaspoon all right do not question it you'll see when that comes to a simmer it thickens up we're going to let that simmer on medium low for about eight minutes in the meantime we're going to grate your cheese I have three cups of mixed cheeses I'm using a cheddar Gouda and Gris air mixture which is quite fantastic turn off the heat and add your cheese in a couple additions saving about 3/4 of a cup for the top alright now I had these cheeses left over but for you I think you should use all cheddar that's what Thomas Jefferson used for man cheddar but to any cheese is your favorite cheese's at work I think a sharp cheddar cheese really is the best but hey that's just me and with the heat off that's just going to melt in there and it's going to make this beautiful creamy cheesy sauce so while our cheese is melted in and the last thing here I'm going to add a teaspoon of Dijon mustard I don't like dry mustard alright so now let's talk pasta we're going to slow things down here because I got to talk to you people most of these recipes for this amount of cheese sauce are going to call for eight ounces of pasta I'm going to use a whole box which is one pound which makes a very still delicious version but not as cheesy not as creamy much lighter much lower fat if you want to split the difference you put in 12 ounces so adjusting the amount of pasta you can really alter this recipe to your personal taste once you decide make sure the pasta is well drained dump it in the casserole dish no need to butter it don't believe the hype it's not going to stick let my stick a little bit it's okay you scrape it out you're going to pour in your cheese sauce distribute it then you're going to sprinkle over the rest of the cheese then the secret to a perfect macaroni and cheese crust you only want a half a cup of bread crumbs and you want the Japanese panko bread crumbs you too can find them yes they're in the store yes don't argue they're in the Asian section of your grocery store then just a tablespoon of butter mix it up put it on top that's going to adhere to that layer of cheese on top and you're going to get the best crust ever you're going to put that in a 400 degree oven that's kind of hot I know but I want the top to caramelize and Brown I mean I'm not trying to cook the inside I don't know why you would cook this for like an hour at you know 350 or a lower temperature I'm just trying to brown the top everything else is cooked if 400 that took me about 20 minutes just watch it when it's brown take it out and you're done perfectly crisp crust all right I'm going to let this cool just a little and then I'm going to dish it out and it is truly amazing now see the holes in the pasta see the hole of there on the left the elbow for the one-pound package of pasta those are not going to be filled with cheese sauce the pasta is going to be very nice very tasty very cheesy but it's not going to be like running with cheese sauce if you use the 8 ounces of pasta version you will have a lot more cheese sauce okay so it's up to you Thomas Jefferson the inventor of macaroni cheese also the author of the Declaration of Independence he and our founding fathers fought for our right to put in as much or as little macaroni in our macaroni and cheese as we damn well please so never forget the principles on which this country was founded and that's it macaroni cheese how easy was that all right go to the site get the ingredients and as always enjoy
