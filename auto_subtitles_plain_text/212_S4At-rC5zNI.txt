 just give us a bit of the packets of mastery barber used to be bangers and mash my mother never made me bang as much she made me known bag a prat first gen bit cat awful dry but this is far superior from the UK in with some red onions and some star anis just to boost some of those meaty flavors and here you see I'm just using a skillet pan don't you if you can don't use a nonstick pan because you won't get that fond if you can see that collection of flavor in the base of the pan which I just continually deglaze let that water evaporate and then let that fum build up again and then add water again and repeat that process about three or four times then I just add some garlic and cook that off about 30 seconds and then I add some flour and cook that off for about two minutes then I add a load of water and then I kind of go a little bit crazy with the ingredients I add quite a lot I just really want to just to showcase some of the ingredients that you can put into such a gravy as so some chicken stock some Tabasco some HP sauce not not a lot of any of these ingredients just tiny amounts some Marmite that is a really great flavor booster some bay leaves some Worcester Chester Shire sauce some pepper and I wouldn't wouldn't say you'd have to add all of these ingredients but it really was a fantastic gravy some balsamic and some ketchup and these all thicken the gravy as well so you don't need to add as much flour and you'll still get quite a nice thick gravy and then I take out the bay leaves and I add in some rosemary of some sage and then I just turn off the heat I don't want to cook those herbs aggressively they're just browning off the sausages and now I am going to make my mash I've boiled some potatoes I may put some milk and some butter in the pan and some mustard some horseradish some pepper and then I'm Irish my potatoes I find that this gives them gives you a much smoother mash than using a potato masher and then I add some parmesan I just tried that out because I saw Nigel Slater doing that once and I thought I'd try it out and a bit more milk because it wasn't very it was a bit too thick and here it needed seasoning and I always look is there anything I can use over than just salt to season my food and in this case I thought celery salt would work quite well and it did and there you go there it is there it is lovely delicious really good bye bye
