 all righty chef buck here and today we're cooking up a decadent delectable awesome spaghetti carbonara if you've never tried carbonara you know definitely give this a go its luscious you want to love it get a little pecorino romano write that up you know we're gonna use about 1/2 a cup I'm actually gonna use a little bit more than that then I'm gonna use three egg yolks just the yolks three and then one entire egg you want to whip those eggs up together and go ahead and add your cheese into there now use about a half a cup of cheese but really I'm using about 3/4 a cup cuz I'm going cheese crazy today you know so this mixture it's gonna be really kind of thick and look how yellow that is you know but that's the way it's gonna look because we're using mostly yolks but that's really what's gonna make this dish so delicious and creamy use some pancetta if you got it but I'm gonna try some thick sliced bacon I got a local farm around here and this bacon is already peppery and you know peppers a big part of this dish and it's making us thick so I'm gonna go ahead and cut that up use this here if you use some pancetta whatever you use you want it to be nice and thick and cubed now fix your spaghetti upper corner near the package directions and just put a little bit of salt in there not a whole lot cuz you know what the cheese is gonna have salt in it and you know the bacon is gonna have salt in it so you don't need a lot of extra salt in this dish get your skillet heated up and we'll go ahead and start working on this bacon and getting that cooked up and if you want it to you can put a little bit of onion and garlic in here too but we're making kind of a classic you know semi classic carbonara so we're gonna leave that out today but what you do want to put in is pepper and all the pepper you can handle this Bacon's already got pepper in it but I'm still throwing some more pepper on here so you know carbonara is all about the pepper now we want to cook our bacon all up we want to cook it through but we don't want it to be crispy you know definitely don't want it to be crispy but you're gonna want to pull off some of that bacon grease there at the end when you're just about ready to finish cuz you're not gonna want all that grease there you don't have to be militant about getting out of the pan a little bit of that's gonna be great flavor but you don't strain that and then your pasta should be ready and then we'll just go ahead and dip our pasta out of this pane and throw it right in our skillet there now don't drain or rinse your posturing just throw it right in there swish it around get it mixed in with this meat get all these flavors all throughout this pasta you know and you want to do that before you put your sauce in there because you want to put your sauce on top of this pasta and meat don't throw your sauce into the skillet with the bacon because you don't want scrambled eggs man you want sauce you want a nice creamy egg sauce so go ahead and pour that on top you don't get it all in there now mine's really kind of sick cuz I got all this cheese in there but that's fine because what we're gonna do is we're gonna work it through you know we're gonna swish it in swirl it all around and it's gonna produce this wonderful creamy delicious egg sauce and if you've never had it you know you gotta try it this is such an awesome flavor it's gonna be so creamy but we're not putting any cream in it and if you wanted to you could put a little bit of fresh parsley in here you know for a little bit of color that's up to you but man look at this it's just fantastic and then that's it you're good to go you can go ahead and plate this up throw it out there for the public man and they're gonna look spaghetti carbonara it's awesome so go ahead and give it a try let me know what you think and Bon Appetit all righty thanks for checking out the video and if you make it I hope you like it you know stop and smell the roses and smile at strangers
