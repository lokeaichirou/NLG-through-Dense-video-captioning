 hi foodtube my name is tamas and i am passionate about spice and meskan food and today i'm going to be cooking you the best ever steak tacos with my favorite roast salsa and this one is a real corker so let's get cooking so the first thing I've got to do is make a marinade for my steak the state we're going to use today is skirt steak and this money will just tenderize it and really bring out all its flavor so I've got my garlic clove I'm going to add a pinch of salt and just mash it up that salt this garlic is ready for the marinade got my skirt steak just going to throw that garlic in we want the juice of half a lime just going to squeeze that lime in and that acidity will really start breaking down those sinews there we are bit of pepper pinch more salt and just a tiny bit of olive oil and he can sit marinating for half an hour an hour four hours really whatever you like now I'm going to wash my hands ready to make the best ever salsa so in Mexico making the best salsa is a fiercely contested competition everyone's got their own recipes everyone makes them fresh every day this is my favorite one I think it's delicious so first of all I've got some garlic cloves I've toasted in a dry frying pan and look how easily this skin is just flaking off and toasting the garlic really really softens the flavor makes it much more gentle and gives a quite a nice charred edge so throw the tomatoes and the garlic I've dry roasted in frying pan and this method of cooking is archetype fully Mexican and it adds a wonderful charred flavor into your salsa totally delicious now some people might think that looks burnt but I swear it gives the best best flavor to your salsa so go with it and test it out yourself so in they go I'm just going to gently work these tomatoes into a mush now of course you can use a food processor here but the texture just won't be the same so you can see that with a pestle and mortar you really get that texture if I put this for blitzer it will just be a completely smooth puree whereas here I've got a lovely rough textured and you can see some of that blackened skin she's going to taste delicious so now that that's into a rough kind of mush I'm going to add some onion and some chopped coriander and in rest'll that goes we've got some onion so the onion is not only going to give this salsa a lovely freshness the sharpness there's Sidda to the onion is actually essential for the salsa but also that lovely crunch will give you texture in the salsa so what's this also missing chili you can't have a salsa without chili so this is to put these in adobo Chipotle's are the smoked dried jalapeno you can't get a hold of any of the shops just use a jalapeno a fresh one a fresh green chili roast it just the way I did for tomatoes shove it in that will give you some lovely heat to it I'm going to add a great tablespoon and it's going to give this salsa a bit of smoky wonderful heat so I'm just going to stir this round gently that needs some fresh lime acidity you can always use vinegar the Mexicans love vinegar for cutting through rich flavors but are you going to use fresh lime here half a lime should do it and it goes and that is my sour made now all I need to do is cook my steak and we're ready to eat your tacos so my skirt steaks Miley my pan is really hot just going to shake the excess marinade off and in it goes to the pan while that's cooking another perfect a compliment to a steak taco are spring onions but we want them nice and charred I'm just going to roll them in that lovely olive oil marinade and pop them onto this pan perfect and we want these spring onions to be really nice and charred just like in the markets and they are so good in these states we're just going to season with a bit of lime and they'll be delicious and there's that steak we're going to leave him to rest on that board and that all I need to do is heat up my tortillas I've got some cool ones here but you can use flour wraps you can kind of use anything really I'm going to just put them on my flattop here sprinkle a little bit water on so now I need to cut that steak so the most important thing with skirt steak is you cut it across the grain not with the grain so I'm going to cut it across the grain often flipping gorgeous that ah it's delicious bits of meat right make some tacos okay got my tortillas cut some steak I've got that salsa full of that smoky Chipotle flavor those charred onion this is just gonna be a mouthful delicious salsa smoky fiery full of flavor I'm completely fresh bit of avocado squeeze the fresh lime and those delicious spring onions which need all that lime over to gonna be delicious time to talk in that steak for creamy avocado that smoked you put your salsa that is Mexican Street food at its finest its sensational if you like this don't forget to click on the thumbs up share with your friends and don't forget to subscribe
