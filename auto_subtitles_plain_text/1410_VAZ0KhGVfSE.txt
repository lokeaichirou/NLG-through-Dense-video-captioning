 hi I'm chef Tom I'm a professional chef I've trained all over the world I've learned all kinds of color secrets nan the teaching field [Music] we're going to make a very classic Italian American recipe chicken parmesan so start with we're going to have our chicken breasts here and you know put a little stern wrap on top and underneath it kind of helps when you pound it so it doesn't make a big mess we start pounding this start with a smaller side first and what you want to do is make this whole thing even so this is already thin don't pound this side pound this rest of it to be that size so pound it out see it's getting a little bit bigger you know when I use the flat side a little bit to even allow flip it over do this side too [Music] one a little thinner a little bit thicker well you guys side that but that's wrong the stuff on this so now we did a standard breading procedure so here we have seasoned flour we have eggs a little bit of water you want to school up a watering to make it a little bit looser and we have seasoned breadcrumbs these are panko breadcrumbs but you know if you wanted Italian flavor breadcrumbs we're going to use that's fine so here's a chicken breast we just pound it out and put a little salt pepper on this guy and flour egg wash and now we're from the breadcrumbs now some things really have to worry about when you're doing when you're breading something is you don't have these things in one layer one of the first catering jobs ever did was that your chicken parmesan like 50 people and what it done was I had brittle all and I stack on top of each other so when I got to the site the bread crumbs from the top and bottom all meld together it's one big chunk of chicken parmesan horrible so I had to go out in the side and hose it down with garden hose and repr it on site so don't do that one layer and I'll be fine so now next step is we're going to fry it so one find this some things you have to worry about do not put the oil above a third of the pan so what happens a lot of times you put too much oil in there the oil spanners up goes into the burners catch on fire that's a bad day you don't want that to happen so now we have our chicken breasts now when you put this in I want to put this down and away you do not want to have this come towards you so if the oil is going to fly let's go that way and that towards you so be careful about that okay now let's sit there for about a minute flip it over make sure it's nice and golden brown beautiful at this point what you want to do is you want to finish this an oven you can check this by putting a little slit right here with your paring knife to see if it's cooked either way or put some sauce and cheese on there and I'll be fine so now we're sauce chicken parmesan this is a sauce we made in New York your recipe nice amount of sauce on top of there cheese cheese it up don't be shy with cheese a little sticks the pan that's okay that's good now we're gonna put it in the oven about four degrees oven for about 5-10 minutes the cheese is golden brown while the chicken is cooking order to put the pasta in the water remember when you do pasta the water needs to be salty like the sea so makes you have enough salt in there we don't put the salt in there it's not going to taste right even you put it enough Rado sauce just just going to have a really funny taste to it so okay now the possum is done we want to get the sauce going so want to take a little bit of sauce in here put in the pan start getting nice and half so I want to take the pasta out of the water and drop into the sauce and give us a little shake we want to make sure the pass is all covered by the sauce it's one of the things I see a lot of restaurants do that it doesn't quite sit well with me so you want to make sure that sitting there nice and marinated for a couple minutes so let's once all set we want to do the passes you want to take the pasta out lift it up and just give it a little half a twist put the rest stuff on top of it take out our chicken parmesan [Music] put that right on top a little bit parsley on top of that and here's your chicken parmesan [Music] Oh [Music]
