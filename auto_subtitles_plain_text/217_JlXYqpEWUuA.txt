 sausages a good way to do them is with tomato and onion gravy in their own it's the frying on the outside of a brown tree because this opposing this is the brown this can actually wash off and this is what gives the gravy its flavor that around the sides and I don't sweet'n output click not a a better choice for the tires on from that little boy - Marcus you say Sebago I say Sebago whistles just switch these I got what you deserve as well as you can make the ones that are on the inside to the outside put the ones on the outside slice it to the heat okay say this chemistry minute all makes what I'm about to do you know do you think of the shape of the sausage right you've got a clean edge you can contact with the frypan all the time which means that there's not a lot of surface area for the heat to get in and cook the sausage so you're on a flip in it all the time or the other thing that people do is just sit there and burn the crap out of it so that it's cooked on the inside but then it's all burning why not some water bodies we're finishing off the cooking by we should have really come to the boil by essentially just poaching them in the hot water and then the the juice a little bit of juice and flavor that comes out in the war we've got left when we finish we'll use to make great well if that's just kind of the timers are just going to be pulling away there so this is all you know I'm sorry thank you that needs to reduce now take it off completely thank you so what are we doing we're eliminating some of the water that the dummy over poured that completely exonerated it doesn't need I need my glass full of water and so put that in there you need about you know however much graver you want a cup of a cup and a half something like that tomorrow's Bellinis idea because sausages can be a bit salty and the tomorrow as the acidity and the sweetness of the tomato by the saltiness of your gravy a little it go on this here it's nothing to say I'm scandal or it's just yes or none that was that's fine as it is for now thanks both some of us have been chunka foreign these would also service instead of with potato mash you can send the polenta it also be very nice now that's getting down to the soil level we want and as I said the tomatoes will help take away the saltiness was a the sausage if you just pop them under the grill and now sort of reroute to soften up the tomatoes and get them to release release their juices not release their Jesus sometime let the tomatoes were loose there Jesus must retain their juices at all if you find that the gravies are the big thing and you'd like to thicken it up just mix a little bit of flour with cold water and tip it in towards the end I'm sorta I'm ok with the gravy being a bit thin to be honest actually unto us is in the word virtuous means oily and repulsive can mean oily in the physique as in oleaginous or it can mean oily in us like a sort of person who's a bit slimy and a bit too ingratiating and these just might be a bit also I think that's a bit much tomorrow actually elite salt-n-pepa check that thing it's very old I've got this wrong it's very storage for about ten years while we've been overseas emasculating so you have to still at st. peppercorns in about we see how it looks in neurons I just want to quickly do the time be careful blue the green my name is John water now that is actually starting to yeah that's good I just - can you turn that off their posters been there done that my puns are getting more rancid out they really rancid yeah irani and great snow you're the one who brought all the Adventists into this or whatever the word was I didn't say all the happiness I said an to us what's that a bit of pre cracked pepper Rebecca it was sort of whipping into some extent there what a de merely crossed pair of legs okay on a permit and chubby person yeah yeah outside the key to cooking sausages no your sausage like you can I've cooked this before Lynn hey and sometimes if you like if you poach the sausages too long they sort of end up a bit wizened in a bit you know like you've you've cooked too much a bit dry so much the moistures come out and go on into the gravy that should have stayed in the sausage but you know natural casing is the key that manufactured casings if they might still say they're natural but they're made from collagen or something and they've got a sheen to them in a plastic you look good stay away from that and obviously the quality of the sausage is key if you use a cheap sausage that's got the this sort of soft really finally meets tamashii middle it's like toothpaste toothpaste sausage but I do feel you have to learn your sausage you find one that you like yeah I agree know your sausage
