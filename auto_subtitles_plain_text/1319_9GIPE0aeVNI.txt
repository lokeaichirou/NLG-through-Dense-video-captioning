 hi my name is erina pan pastiche of cape cod and today I'm gonna make a classic caesar salad one of my family's favorites all right so if you've never made a Caesar salad before we're gonna start with a raw egg nice fresh egg I'm gonna take my whisk and some nice olive oil I'm gonna beat that together that looks great then I'm going to take a nice fresh lemon and I'm gonna just take out some of the seeds you're still gonna get I know there's a trick you can use cheesecloth and not have the seeds bla bla bla but I don't I don't have any cheesecloth so I'm just gonna squeeze in the lemon I'll pick up the seeds afterwards so next I'm going to put in some mustard couple of blobs like that maybe a little bit more I'm going to add some with just your sauce some ground pepper and I'm going to also add a little bit of fresh sea salt take a nice cup it really nice maybe two cloves of fresh garlic and put that in there now I'm going to take the end toby's I have about three anchovies here I like the white anchovies they're really great but these aren't families are just a regular one so you can get at the grocery store and I just shred them with two forks you're gonna mix that all together looking really good already can I like to take some fresh Parmesan cheese and a grater and this will thicken it up even a little bit more almost done then you're gonna take your romaine of course wash I usually get rid of the top because I nobody really likes to eat it I never there's any bad leaves just take them off and you're just gonna coat all the lettuce with that great Caesar dressing take some grated Parmesan cheese again fresh that I did ahead of time and the last but not least we're going to add some homemade croutons and you're all done excellent can't wait to eat it
