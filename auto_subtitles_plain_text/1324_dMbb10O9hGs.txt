 one of the most frequently requested recipes on the one pot chef show is for mashed potatoes I've never quite understood why because it seemed like such a simple recipe I was surprised that so many people email me asking for this particular recipe until I did a bit of research and discovered that virtually no cookbooks or online sites have very specific recipes for mashed potato they often request it for other recipes but do not actually give a specific way of cooking it so I thought I'm going to remedy that situation by putting together a nice little video showing you how to make two different versions of mashed potato the firm version that is pretty much everyone's used to and a nice soft creamy version that's suitable for piping or just having the nice sloppy version that everyone loves so it's mashed potatoes other one-putt chef you so mashed-potato is now the first thing that people need to learn when it comes to magic potatoes is consistency is everything you've got to get the right consistency in order to make sure it all stays together nicely if you put too much of one thing or not enough of another it's going to turn into a mess so first of all I have peeled and chopped one kilo of potatoes now I'll just this is in water at the moment so I'm just going to take a one of these out as you can see it's a very small piece about maybe 1 to 2 centimeters square about an inch piece roughly you need to have small pieces smaller pieces will cook quicker and more consistently it's like any other kind of cooking the smaller the food the quicker and better it cooks so we put this in some water I'm just going to put the lid on and we're going to bring that to the boil and let it boil for about 15 to 20 minutes at which point we can take a piece out test to see if it's cooked properly the way you take it out give it a bit of a press with your finger and if it sort of pushes up you know it's ready to go so we'll start boiling this and I'll show you what to do next well it's been 15 to 20 minutes and we've just finished boiling the potatoes I've drained them off in the sink so first thing we're going to do is just mash them up with a potato masher we've got rid of all the big lumps out of that as you can see because we've cooked them the right way they're nice and smooth for the moment so we're going to throw in about a tablespoon of butter excess of that and we're just going to stir that through until it's all melted through seasoned with salt and pepper and just stir that through a moment now at this point you can add some garlic if you want to make garlic mashed potatoes you could add cheese who want to make a cheesy mash potatoes basically this is your firm basic mashed potatoes done so you can serve as is if however you want to make it that smooth creamy stuff especially if you're trying to make it a bit fancier you can use like a icing pipe or something like that to sort of make an arrangement on the plate then we can add something else you can use sour cream you can use thickened cream I'm going to use a little bit of milk we just add a small amount at a time about up to half a cup at most and you just slowly add it until you get the consistency that you're looking for as you can see I'm just adding a little dribble at a time and you can already see that's becoming a lot smoother and fluffier Little Miss business that's looking fabulous just like that and that's looking just about right there so I don't think we'll add any more there so that's about a quarter of a cup of milk all up there as I say consistency is the key you've just got to add a little bit at a time until you get what you're looking for and then we have perfect creamy mashed potatoes and perfect firm mashed potatoes first time every time well I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at youtube.com slash one-pot chef show and until next time see you later
