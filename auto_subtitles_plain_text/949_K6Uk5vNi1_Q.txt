 hi welcome to show me the car come I'm hit oh I'm Anita and today we're going to show you how to make a very popular dish to turn our chicken which is from the southern part of India part of Tamil Nadu a couple of steps involved first we're gonna dry roast a lot of our spices to really bring out the aroma and the flavor of these spices so we have a pan heating up here on medium heat medium to low heat and we're going to be dry roasting and anytime you're dry roasting avoid nonstick stick to something which is heavy bottomed and not nonstick so first goes in this is about an inch and a half piece of cinnamon we're just gonna break it down so it all cooks evenly with three whole green cardamoms 4 cloves about 7 to 8 red chilies depending on how spicy you like it and how spicy - these are absolutely so are some are not very spicy and some hearts are using the few of this and a few of that just so that you get the color the flavor and a little bit of spice but not you know ourselves and I just broke them down again it releases a lot of the seeds from inside and flavors everything if 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cumin seeds 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of fennel seed 2 teaspoon of coriander seed and 1 table spoon of poppy seeds or khuskhus you're going to mix it and we're going to keep stirring it as soon as it reaches a nice golden color we're gonna add half a cup of coconut this is fresh coconut with your little shredded now we're going to cook this or keep roasting it and it's still on low we're gonna keep roasting it till the coconut gets a little bit of a color and it basically kind of gets a little dehydrated so this looks done it so kind of dehydrate it and that's going to turn off the stove transfer it and allow it to cool down and meanwhile start working on the next step there our masala that we dry roasted has cooled down to the touch it's not hot anymore and we have a grinder here we're gonna take this masala and grind it into a smooth paste and we're gonna use a little bit of water and one of those doing that so we have over here a large skillet now you want a big enough but it has to be able to use to accommodate everything we are making a bigger amount this time so here we have three tablespoons of oil and let's check and make sure of its what okay then add one large onion finely chopped and I'm just gonna add a little bit of salt just to speed up the process and you're gonna cook it till the onions get a little translucent and while I'm grinding this masala I'm just gonna add a little bit of water at a time you don't want to add too much or it kind of prevents the grinding from happening I'm starting with about 1/4 cup the onions are done they look Brown and ready we're ready for 1 tablespoon of minced garlic 1 tablespoon of minced ginger and half a teaspoon of turmeric powder we also have a few sprigs of curry leaves and a little extra really tastes good in this recipe and you're just gonna cook it for a minute and are we ready for the feast now we let the dry roasted spices cool down completely and then use the spice grinder to grind it down and we have to use about half a cup of water to help us in the grinding process so it's finely ground into a paste we're going to add it in and one teaspoon of red chili powder and it's just gonna cook it for just another minute more now sharing that food is known for a lot of flavor and also a lot of fight oh you know there's a lot of places where you can cut back and you can still get the flavor so don't be scared of that aspect of the dish coconut there so that also utilizes the effect of the chilies and we're ready to add two large tomatoes chopped and basically just cook it till the oil separates and we're gonna cook it uncovered so our masala mixture I've cooked down quite a bit and the oil is kind of leaving the site we're ready to add our chicken we're using approximately two and a half pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs but it's completely up to you whether you want to have boned or non bone or any other parts of the chicken I'm Nick so mix it well and we're just gonna allow you to cook for about five minutes on medium heat itself so it's been five minutes and we've been stirring in between just to make sure nothing gets burned all our hard work doesn't go to having the color is amazing and the aroma and my god so now is a perfect time to add your salt add a little bit we also had at in the beginning are in the onions so just keep that in mind and we're gonna squeeze some fresh lime this is to taste and I'm just gonna mix it and we're gonna add about between two and three cups of water depending on the consistency that we want so we're gonna start with two and if we need more we'll add it I'm just gonna add a little bit into my spice grinder so I don't waste any of that yummy spice don't freak out it's going to pick it up the gravy's gonna get thicker and it also it'll evaporate a little bit and you want to have the option of having the rice or chapatti actually tastes very good with dosa and interesting it and once it's mixed we'll cover and we're gonna cook this for approximately 20 to 25 minutes but basically until the chicken is tender it's been 20 minutes our chicken looks fantastic we just kind of broke a piece over here it says it broke really easily so it means extender and it's ready to go and also we checked on the salt in the spice level and everything again it was perfect end up quite a bit you notice all the the watery stuff has gone out and nice smooth gravy be perfect on rice and right before serving as always we're gonna garnish with a few coriander or cilantro leaves and it will be ready to serve so enjoy your chettinad chicken and join us again another sort of show me the crack on adding a pinch of spice to your life
