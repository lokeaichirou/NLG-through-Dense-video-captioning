 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura to kitchen I want to share with you one of my favorite what I call fancy sandwiches it's something that make once in a while for my husband and I and it's a real treat but I love getting this any time you like a French cafe or a French bistro it's a croque monsieur it's really a French ham and cheese sandwich not to be confused with a Monte Cristo that's a different kind of sandwich is i that's a different kind of sandwich I often hear people confuse the two this is a croque monsieur and in a different recipe in a different video I will show you how to make a Monte Cristo but the ingredients you'll need aren't very many and are not any fancy ingredients you'll need some I've got some Swiss here but you could use Gruyere and I've got some ham this is just deli ham and some Swiss cheese you'll need some Parmesan Reggiano nutmeg butter flour milk salt and pepper Dijon mustard and some bread I'm using my homemade honey wheat bread because it is hearty enough to stand up to this dish gives it a touch of sweetness with the salty cheeses and the salty ham it's just a really incredible combination it really are it's amazing so but traditionally use a white bread or like a rustic French bread but that's what I'm using I use different kinds of bread all the time depending on what I have on hand what I decided to bake you know that week or whatnot so that's what I'm using now I've got my oven preheated we're preheating over about 400 degrees and now what I'm going to do I have a baking sheet that I've lined with some aluminum foil and what I'm going to do is I'm going to brush a little bit of melted butter on both sides of my bread because I'm going to toast this I want the bread to be toasted because I feel like it holds up to the sandwich much better I want to toast it when it's toasted so I'm just going to brush it on both sides with some butter because it gives it not only great flavor but it also helps get nice and golden brown do that on both sides look good I used up all my butter great okay I'm going to pop this into the oven for about ten minutes or until it's really beautiful lovely golden brown and toasted and I'm most likely going to flip it halfway through or just keep my eye on it and flip it if I need to just to make sure both sides or golden brown and toast sticks in this little saucepan I've got my butter melting I'm going to add to that my flour and now what we're making is a really quick fashion L so really quick easy cream sauce because traditionally Monte Cristo has bash them out with it now don't think to yourself I'm not going to go through all that trouble for a ham and cheese sandwich this literally takes minutes to do and it is a total treat something that I would make for the weekends or something like that and I just added my milk and you can see that the flour is still in clumps but once it everything heats up it gets to everything melts and it is perfect and it really is one of the most delicious fancy sandwiches when my husband and I absolutely love it I love this with a fris√©e salad with some Lord ohms and maybe even a poached egg if I'm feeling fancy if I'm not feeling like doing a poached egg maybe I'll do a quick madam which is a croque monsieur with an egg on top I'll show you that in a different episode but it's delicious whoops I'm just going to let this cook until everything thickens and I'm waiting for that flour to pretty much melt completely this shouldn't take very long at all it's looking good it's nice and thick I'm gonna add my grid parmigiana I just created some parmesan reggiano I'm actually gonna turn that off and then I'm gonna add some salt and pepper and a touch of nutmeg easy on the nutmeg because it can go from delicious do pumpkin pie spice it's because you know it is a pretty strong spice so you want to make sure that you go kind of light on it but it does I think add a world of a difference to your cream sauce okay stir that in it's going to be nice and thick because especially well now that you've added your cheese it's really thick I'm going to set this aside check on my bread get it out and assemble and we are really close to eating actually my breads nice and toasted so now we're ready pretty much to assemble I am going to take some Dijon mustard I love Dijon mustard I really really do and I especially love Dijon mustard when it comes to ham and cheese I just think it's a fantastic it just like a match me in heaven I have to say that Dijon mustard and like coarse ground mustard or my favorite so I'm going to put a good layer on one of the pieces of bread you can do both if you want does it matter I'm just going to do a 1 piece of bread I said I want it to be too too strong and then I'm going to take some Swiss I do one slice I'm gonna cut this in half like that and then you take your ham and do a couple slices of ham because these are really thin slices which by the way that's how I like it if you can chitchat with your deli person which you should be able to you can tell them hey listen cut my ham a little bit thinner because I don't like it to be too thin even though I'm using a couple of slices I really do feel like the flavor is better if it's thinner and just put a couple more slices on there that you two originally thought you were going to use hope that make sense and then I'm going to put the other slice of cheese on the top so it's two slices into slices and then I go ahead and put top now this is a knife and fork sandwich this is not a pickup with your hands in any kind of sandwich now our sauce has gotten really thick because it's been sitting here while the bread was toasting but that's what it does and once it goes into the oven which by the way at this point I have my broiler preheated I'm gonna put some of my sauce on here it is full of parmigiano which you guys know I love I'm just going to smear this like so and it looks weird but trust me it is heaven in your mouth as soon as this comes out of the oven it really is it gets hot and it's bubbly and it's just fabulous then you take one piece of cheese like so and I'm going to pop this under the broiler don't put this directly under the broiler I actually put this on my lower rack so it's kind of almost the furthest away from the broiler so that I can stay in there a little bit longer to get everything heat up and then once the cheese is bubbling and it's melted and it's golden brown we're ready to serve and that's it but it isn't I'm telling you this is like a word worthy that's how good the sandwiches it really is in a sandwich because you need a knife and fork to eat it I just took these out of the oven and look at that I mean that is just perfection I'm going to cut into this so that you can see smells phenomenal it is cheesy it is just glorious it's very hot this point but if anyone will risk eating a hot sandwich for you guys this checker let me get a bite of this oh I can't wait I mean look look at the ham over the cheese look at the bubbliness on top it is perfection give me a second thought because this is really hot a bigger bar than I thought mmm that is money hmm salty but not too salty it's cheesy and creamy on the top the breads nice and toasted so it really holds the shape really really well and that mustard it's just amazing that is definitely a sandwich sandwich fit for company good ol are in the kitchen I'll come look at this recipe I hope you enjoy spending time with me guys and I will see you next time bye
