 hi everyone this is the lighthouse lady today I'm going to make a grilled cheese sandwich I like to use frozen honey white bread today I'm going to use provolone cheese sometimes I use sharp cheese American cheese it's all a matter of choice and some smart balanced buttery spread I like to butter the bread rather than put the butter in the pan it seems to cover the bread better that way and the reason why I use frozen bread it takes a little longer for the bread to cook and that way the cheese melts also place one slice of bread in the pan which I'm going to use three of these thin slices of provolone I like to flip it over just as the butter starts to melt to the other side it also gives the cheese time to start to melt on each side how do you make your grilled cheese well there it is looks mighty tasty to me thanks for watching
