our grill grill is getting hot and ready right now so what I'm going to be doing I got I've got three chicken breasts now these these we call them sis kebabs as well so I've got my sis kebab of three long scores that we can use well I have three chicken breasts so I'm going to cut those up right now and two nice big chunks that I can put on the scores I guess I want to make them about about one HR all the way around somewhere around that i'm going to add that to my bowl and then i have the same thing with the port what kind of pork i'm using is the bonus country-style ribs tho those work very well alright so I've got about a pound of that yes that's actually a lot I mean for what I'm going to be doing with just three scores but i'm gonna i'm going to make more than that a beautiful thing about this is you can you can just keep keep making them to you know till you run out of schools or run out of meat run out of vegetables etc sister bombs are wonderful they're a wonderful thing for the summertime beautiful simple ready to eat i'm actually going to be making mine with serving on a on a bed of rice this because that's what i want to do but today i'm going to try this mccormick jerk seats jamaican jerk seasoning this is a rub seasoning mix rabbit i'm just going to try that too then i'm gonna throw myself a little bit of garlic powder on there actually has a pretty good smell I'm going to throw a little bit of lemon juice just dash of that acidity in there I'm going to throw a little bit of my body I complete seasoning just a little sprinkle up not much and gonna you know what that message to that I have some going to just mix all that together it's all those seasonings up and what's what you're going to want to do is let let this sit for at least an hour and then cook it but you can also leave it in overnight as well to maximize the flavor and now for the vegetables all right I'm going to be using some zucchini beautiful thing about these shish kebabs you can make them however you want them I'm just going to I'm not going to take all the skin off i'm just gonna make the design let's get off I'm gonna make those into about half-inch sized pieces now I've got some I've got a package of button button mushrooms I've already washed them already I'm gonna just going to take the the insides out it stems out and i'm going to put those in there I've got myself a half of a green pepper I'm going to cut those into some nice half-inch pieces as well I love grilled vegetables so this combination of the groove and grow vegetables is just wonderful I think that's fine the best way to eat vegetables grown I look growth anything it doesn't take much all right and then I have a tomato now tomato I bought one is a little bit firm because I obviously I don't want it falling off of my school it's not i mean it is it's not it's not over right and it's not under right it's just right but I want to make sure it stays on the score grilled tomatoes 114 all right the last thing I'm going to do is get myself a nice onion and this is a regalia onion let me give an extra dollar onion and I'm going to going to make that make some nice pieces that fit on too much school a while all right now to my vegetables what I'm going to do I'm going to take some olive oil and I'm going to drizzle some olive oil all over my vegetables I'm going to take a little bit more my lemon juice will just dash that over there win a total garlic powder on there and then a little bit of salt and black pepper and I'm just going to take a little bit of that jamaican jerk seasoning and just lightly a little bit on there as well quick mix hmm alright so now Stuart I'm school time mmm so I'm going to take some chicken pork take myself on these nice little mushrooms tomato King up this bunion one egg green pepper just go ahead and just start assembling the where way you want whoever you want some meat vegetables we're putting these on the grill and make sure you have your grill hot and then also make sure that it is nice and oiled we don't want these sticking and ripping as you're trying to flip them around so you've got that you've got them on the grill all right so I've been leaving it on here been out here about 15 minutes already I just keep rotating it want to make sure and I don't stay on one side for too long doesn't get burned up or anything like that but what are things I don't want you to make sure if you got big chunks of move I'm going to make sure they get cooked all the way to the center you want you may want to use a thermometer your pork should be at 170 and your chicken at 185 in order for it to be done cook you don't want to get anybody sick so make sure you check those temperatures and see you back inside and woke up a few more minutes
