 today we're making shepherd's pie now this is a healthy recipe I'm going to be using ground lamb and we're gonna dress it up with some nice healthy spices like turmeric and cinnamon and we're gonna cut back a little bit on our mashed potatoes and we're gonna replace some of that with some butternut squash so if that sounds good to you stay right here I'm rockin Robin and I'll show you how to do it right after this are you ready to go over our ingredients and get started okay let's do it here's our ground lamb we've got a little over a pound there and this dish here I've got a combination of onion carrot and celery with the superfine dice and I've got some frozen peas some fresh zucchini out of my garden by the way fresh basil out of my garden here I have a couple about three russet potatoes and I've got some butternut squash and here's our spices I got turmeric ground cinnamon and ground cumin and then we're gonna finish it off with some chicken broth I got some fresh minced garlic some butter and a little bit of salt and pepper and over here I've got a little bit of coconut milk and you can substitute half and a half if you like if you don't like coconut milk we are gonna start off our recipe by browning our Lambs so I've got my flame over here on medium-high I'm gonna put a little bit of oil in the pan I didn't mention that in the beginning and I was giving you the all the ingredients but just a little bit of oil get this started off slide that in there all right now we're cooking I'm gonna go ahead and toss in my onions carrots and celery I'm gonna add a little bit of salt for this right now just a little toss of salt in there and I'll show you what this looks like once everything's cooked up while the lamb mixture is cooking we're gonna pour our potatoes in our butternut squash into a steamer and I'm gonna go ahead and keep sort of keep them separated I'll put the potatoes in one side and the squash on the other side because we're gonna separate these out when they're done cooking and we'll just cook these until they are nice and fork tender my lamb mixture here has been cooking for about six to eight minutes I think you can see here there's a quite a bit of fat and I'm gonna drain that off so now we're ready to add the minced garlic I'll just spread that in there and spread that all around the best you can get it to the heat so it nulls out that flavor and we're gonna let this saute here for just about a minute and then we're gonna add the rest of our spices now I'm using a quarter of a teaspoon and you can do as much of this as you like so here's the cinnamon first here's our cumin do the same thing and turmeric turmeric is such a healthy spice guys I try and sneak it in whenever I can and this is a great recipe for this and then I'm gonna add a little bit of my chicken broth that's just gonna help liquefy those spices and make sure that they distribute pretty well and stir that around and I'm probably gonna give it a taste because I want to see if I want more spice now it's time to add my zucchini and the peas the zucchini and peas don't take very long to cook so I'm gonna cover this pot keep it on low and just keep everything nice and hot until ready to ascend our potatoes are done and I'm separating them into two bowls like I mentioned earlier and you also want to heat up your coconut milk and butter together which I'm gonna do in just a second here or if you're using half-and-half or cream you're gonna want to heat that up first in the microwave for just a few minutes get it nice and hot so that when you add it to your potato butternut squash it doesn't cool it off and everything stays nice and hot time to mash our potatoes all right we could start with either one doesn't matter we're going to take our mixture and we're gonna pour half of it into the potatoes and the other half into the butternut squash and this coconut milk is going to give it a nice rich flavor so we'll just mash this up and of course we have to add some salt add a little bit of salt to this go ahead and add a sprinkle to that you can do pepper if you like - this side all right now that we got the mashed potatoes done we're gonna move into the butternut squash and don't be afraid to add a little more milk to your potatoes it just depends I mean it's not an exact science so just get the consistency that you like and I'm also going to add a little bit of cinnamon to my butternut squash just cuz I think it goes really really well with it I'm just gonna sprinkle a little bit on there maybe an eighth of a teaspoon and I'm gonna do a little more turmeric once that's all blended up then we'll be able to put the whole casserole together all right we are ready to put this little thing together I'm gonna go ahead and chop up my basil I haven't done that yet I'm gonna do it just a little ship and odd or we just roll up the leaves together and just give it a nice little slice enough take my butternut squash and we're gonna layer it into the bottom of my 9 by 13 now I have my oven preheating to 450 no 400 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna first pour my butternut squash on the bottom of my dish we're just gonna make a nice thin layer sprinkle the basil into my meat mixture but I'm gonna go ahead and just layer this in I'm gonna pour it in but I'm afraid that it might disturb my butternut squash so I'm just gonna sprinkle it on we'll call it that I've been having an interesting day today first of all I have no running water in my kitchen believe it or not can't wash dishes all what a shame yeah I had to had to turn off the water to the house because a sprinkler valve broke and right in the middle of all this and I'm like that's okay I can deal with it I can get this done no problem but the water thing I tell you it really makes you appreciate water when you don't have it we take so much for granted okay so I'm spreading this on here and as you can see trying to get a nice thin layer with this so I barely got this thing covered with the mashed potatoes but we made it and you can see the three layers right here on the bottom we're gonna pop this in the oven 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes or until it's nice and hot I just took the casserole out of the oven and it is sizzling hot so I'm gonna go ahead and serve this up see if I can get it out so I have a question for you guys what do you call this dish shepherd's pie when it's made with ground beef instead of lamb okay I'll help here we go that bottom layer this smells so incredible so guys try this recipe it smells amazing all those flavors right here we go as I'm diving in let's take a little bit of that butternut squash at the bottom get a little bit of that topping there and the insides with the with the lamb mmm those flavors are amazing very good I hope you guys will try this recipe leave me a comment if you do tell me what you think I really like to hear from you alright everybody if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet be sure and click that button right up there and you'll be notified of new videos that come out with every week thank you so much everybody I really appreciate all your support and your kind comments all right that's it for today I'll see you next time take care
