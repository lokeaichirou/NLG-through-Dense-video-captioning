 welcome to the America Test Kitchen today in your 360 eleven and a half inch frypan we are cooking some tasty hash browns first pre-heat your fry pan over medium heat for a couple of minutes pour a quarter cup of either peanut oil or canola oil into the pan let the oil heat for a couple of minutes you'll see a nice shimmer to the oil when it's hot test the oil by dipping a strand of potato into the fry pan if it sizzles and bubbles like this the pan is ready now add three cups of shredded potatoes that have been thoroughly rinsed drained and patted dry with paper towels be sure the potatoes are dry because water and hot oil will cause spattering press the potatoes down to cover the bottom of the fry pan season lightly with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat 5 to 6 minutes depending on your stovetop now reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes until the potatoes are brown on the bottom turn the potatoes over using a heat proof Turner you don't need to flip all the potatoes at once just take it section by section until they've all been turned now pass the potatoes together to make a large pancake shape cook an additional 10 minutes place the potatoes on a platter aligned with paper towels taste reason if necessary and serve these are nice and crispy and will be perfect with our pancakes and scrambled eggs be sure to check out those videos as well and view our complete recipes online at 360 cook we're calm [Music]
