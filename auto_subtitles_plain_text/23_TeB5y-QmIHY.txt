 the big game is right around the corner and I've got a bunch of people coming over but what are they going to eat I could order pizza but I did that last weekend people like finger foods right how about chips and salsa I've got it mini corn dogs on a stick corn dog pops it's gonna be perfect I have a really good recipe so let's get started you're going to need 1 package of hot dogs make sure that it contains no nitrates because they're really bad for you 3/4 cup of yellow cornmeal 1 cup of all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt or half a teaspoon of kosher salt 3 tablespoons of white sugar 4 teaspoons of baking powder 1 egg 1 cup of buttermilk 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil another quart of vegetable oil for frying and then some extra all-purpose flour for dusting if you don't have buttermilk you can make your own how you do that is take one cup of milk and add a tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice stir it up and voila in a pot put in your corner oil and then put it on the stove and turn it on medium heat now in a large bowl combine your cornmeal flour salt sugar baking powder and whisk it all together then add your egg buttermilk and oil and whisk it up again your batter should look a little thicker than pancake batter I want my corndog pops to be bite-sized so I'm going to cut the hotdogs into quarters but you can leave them whole or cut them in half whatever you want now take your hotdogs and that's the lightly with some of the extra all-purpose flour this will help the batter stick to the hotdog pieces better then insert a lollipop stick or a skewer into each of the hotdog pieces take your hotdog skewer and then dip and rotate it into the batter make sure that it's completely coated then slowly remove it from the batter and let the excess batter drip back into the bowl now it's ready to fry frying the best method for corndogs because you're using a liquid batter and then it develops this crispy outer shell when you cook it to check to see if the oil is hot enough stick a chopstick in the pot and touch the bottom to see if it starts to bubble if it starts to bubble then it's ready now take your batter covered hotdog and immerse it into the hot oil while holding the stick be really careful not to burn yourself cook it for about 2 to 3 minutes or until all the sides are deep golden-brown rotate it to make sure it Browns evenly now take it out of the oil and let it drain on a plate lined with some paper towels the best way to eat this is with some classic ketchup and mustard put it on a platter and serve what a great game so fun our team won everyone ate the food and best of all it's quality time with our friends and family so the next time you have a big sports get-together try these corndogs everyone will go nuts you
