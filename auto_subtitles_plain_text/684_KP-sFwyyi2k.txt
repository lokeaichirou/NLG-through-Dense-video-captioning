 this is how I dry the tofu tofu has a lot of moisture and it won't Brown correctly if it's slow moist then place another plate on top and put a big bowl of water on top of that you can use a big frying pan if you want or if you have a walk you can use it the walk is very hot I'm holding my hand over it and I can feel the heat what you do is this simply put some oil into the bottom of the wall the oil is now very very hot so be very careful with the next step you can see that the tofu is flattering that's good just give it a minute and it's going to turn golden brown now that the tofu hash browns I'm going to take some of this site begin page about a teaspoon fall and I'm going to put it in the tofu so the objective here is to flatten out the bean paste and get it to melt into the oil as you can see a turning the oil a beautiful red day now we're going to add the softest black bean so they are these things are made by pressing them into Saul just add them directly into the tofu these are dried chili flakes and they're very spicy just give a little sprinkle does that look good this is regular sake that I would drink let's pour it in lets out a little vinegar very good now let's add a little soy sauce now we're going to put in two small dried which one style chilies you can put these in with the oil with you I I just forgot it will add the ginger paste now and let's top it off with the green onion tops hmm yeah you want a crazy with vegetables and chilies all in it mm-hmm it has a fermented smell and a salty smell you can add chili paste now if you like it or you can add fresh chili it's time to turn off the heat and transfer this to a plate let's see what it looks like on the plate okay it's all done this is my ma po tofu as you can see there are still lots of whole pieces of tofu but some have broken from the broken one you can see that the sauce has nicely coated the outside leaving a very white interior there are black beans green onions and chilies all in this tofu it looks so good even my dog wants some okay I hope you make this at home it's very easy authentic and delicious enjoy it
