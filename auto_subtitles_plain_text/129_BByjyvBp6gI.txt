 hey guys thanks for cooking with Tammy today I'm going to show you how to make a delicious southern baked macaroni and cheese yay I need to warn you guys this recipe is not only rich with delicious cheeses but it's rich in flavor as well which in my opinion is definitely the thing this video is also part of my holiday series so the amount of ingredients used is going to be a little bit more than the usual because most of us are going to have people coming over for the holidays so with that being said guys let's get started the ingredients that we want to need are 32 ounces of elbow macaroni or two 16-ounce boxes as well as 16 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese eight ounces of pepper jack cheese and 8 ounces of Velveeta cheese as well as 6 tablespoons of butter 1 teaspoon of seasonal salt to taste 1 teaspoon paprika for a nice smoky flavor 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper as well as one teaspoon of garlic powder and one teaspoon of onion powder 4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour two and a half cups of half-and-half for the topping we're also going to need an additional 8 ounce package of cheddar cheese as well as eight ounces of pepper jack cheese keep in mind guys that you're not limited to the type of cheeses that you decide to use alrighty guys moving right along to preparation at this point in time we're going to bring our water to a boil and we're going to add about a tablespoon to two tablespoons of olive oil and this would prevent the pasta from sticking together as well as a couple pinches of salt to flavor the water adding the elbow macaroni to the pot we're going to allow it to boil until it's al dente be sure to check the back of the box for the al dente cooking time because every brand of pasta has a different cooking time once the pasta is al dente we're going to add it to the strainer straining it off and definitely adding cold water to the pasta to stop the cooking process placing our pasta aside we're going to move on to making our cheese sauce in a deepened skillet we're going to add the butter once the butter is melted we're going to add the flour and what we're doing is we're making what's called a roux a roux is used as a thickening agent to make different sauces stirring continuously is going to ensure that there isn't any lumps add seasonings to the mixture while continuing to stir after the seasoning is combined at the half-and-half and continue to stir once everything is combined we're going to add the different cheeses to the mixture and we're going to allow the cheese to melt while continuing to stir at this point in time as you can see everything is beginning to thicken up which is great adding the pepper jack cheese to the mixture so our cheese sauce is going to have three flavors going on we're going to have the sharp taste from the cheddar cheese as well as a hint of spice from the pepper jack cheese and the creaminess not only from the Velveeta cheese but also from the half-and-half so all of the cheese is combined together along with the half-and-half it's going to create this nice delicious creamy texture cheese sauce like I said guys you don't have to limit yourself to the type of cheeses that I use there are so many cheese's out there from fontina cheese to asiago cheese to Gouda cheese some mozzarella cheese just to name a few guys so just play around with it until you find what works best for you all right guys so I've got my pans lined up ready to go and I'm going to start by adding the elbow macaroni to the pan first followed by the decadent creamy cheese sauce using my spatula I'm going to distribute the cheese onto the pasta evenly and guys this cheese is so smooth and creamy all my goodness it literally spreads like mayonnaise after the cheesy sauce is added we're going to top with a combination of shredded cheddar cheese and pepper jack cheese adding more pasta and repeating the process once again we're going to add the creamy cheese sauce on top using the spatula to spread the cheese onto the pasta evenly last but not least we're going to top with a combination of shredded cheddar cheese as well as pepper jack cheese placing the mac and cheese into my 350 degree Fahrenheit preheated oven I'm going to allow the mac and cheese to bake for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the cheese melts alright guys so as you can see our southern baked macaroni and cheese is finished baking this mac and cheese is so gorgeous it could represent itself as always guys thanks to cooking with Tammy definitely give this video a thumbs up subscribe to stay updated with all my latest videos and most of all guys enjoy you
