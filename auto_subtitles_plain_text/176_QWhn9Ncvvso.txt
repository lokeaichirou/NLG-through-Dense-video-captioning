 welcome everyone I'm through and today I'm making a BLT sandwich I've got about five slices of bacon here that I have baked and if you've never heard of bacon bacon go ahead and check out my youtube video on how to bake bacon I don't think you'll ever go back to the frying pan once you try it over here I have mayonnaise now I love mayonnaise on my DLTS if you don't like it keep it off but to me it makes all the difference in the world I put a little fresh cracked pepper on my BLT but my family loves of course the romaine lettuce so we use romaine lettuce it's a real Hardy lettuce but if you like iceberg or any other lettuce that'll do and then of course we've got a beautiful red tomato here and then back here I have some bread that I've toasted I have a whole wheat bread now you may use whichever bread that you like it is your preference but to get the BLT assemble take a little mayonnaise I go from side to side make sure to get all the corners okay just pick it up there show you how I'm doing and and there's nothing better than a delicious fresh BLT I think it is the best and now we're going to go ahead put a little mayonnaise here on the other side and now to get this assemble I'm going to go ahead and get this serving plate out of the way that our two slices of toast here and then I start off on one side and I just layer the bacon slices okay just like that you think they're a little too long you can cut them into no big deal if you don't like them sticking out over the edge and then of course you're going to put your romaine lettuce or whichever lettuce you like over here on this side then you're going to take your tomato and I'm going to give it a nice little slice oh my gosh this tomato looks absolutely delicious look how beautiful that turns out I'm going to just make a nice slice big thick slice of tomato here now if you like then be my guest in you soon with the tomato spec over here and we're going to add this slice right here on to the top of the brain I'm right now rated pepper on it a little bit there on the bacon as well and now we're going to fold it on top like this I'm going to take it at night you see a little ridges little teeth and we're going to cut right down this theory and look in there one spectacular BLT that will melt in your mouth here we go I'm going to try it out hey there that is one VLT you'll make over and over again hey y'all this is grounded thanks for watching I'll catch you next time
