 sausages with an engrave it would have to be an absolute family classic it's easy to do and especially get home late at night and just one get something on quick the secret to make a success is your timing so have you potatoes ready I the gravy we're going to use is just a common variety top shelf gravy but to make a taste really nice instead of using water use some beef stock and that just gives it another level of flavor I've got the butter melted for my mashed potato what it happens you need an onion so step 1 cup toilets trying is the plan is at the same size is the other come at the same time and I will just cut them into quarters now with the sausages get some really good quality ones these ones are Angus bleep and pepper with shiraz so there'll be good diet prick them but we'll talk about that in mind let's get out Tata's on first it's about right always remember a cold war start don't ever put your squads in hot water to back us up the starch and you'll end up the buggy mess adorable okay we've got them on while the chicken away have your five pan reading I start on high heat first just give that a moment is a little bit and then put the heat back its 2 i'm just going to blow and burn the outside sausage and it's something we called right through so i slowed us the better with snacks also you probably split the skins which is not a little better right squally put on our sausages and then we'll just keep turning them to the cook throat okay I'll turn the heat down to medium and what I set these quietly cooked I'll probably take about 10 or so minutes to learn to properly okay while our sausages are cooking and photos of cooking let's get our onion ready to peel the source one that this Mona no bread okay miss water cup your onions is that way so they'll be ready to pop into the pan and we're almost up okay sausages are done now what we're gonna do is cook our onions in the pan and use all these delicious juice into the flavors from the sausages so we need is to take the snare it set up and put them to one side you want to keep them warm Signy the cover them in foil we'll just pop them in the oven I'm sure we're ready for the moment not too much change and we'll just stir these around and brown them to a nice and soft and just every so often check your potatoes to make sure they're ready here if they're ready then we can match them for checking like hair onions are done beautiful caramelized it's pop our gravy in and just stare at em tulip pigeons just damn place now there we go now that's going to be just a little too thick so what I'll blue was kept a little bit of stock on hand and if it does go a little bit thick on here you can just pop some more in and just back it off a little bit that looks about wrong now we'll set this aside now a potato and we're ready to put the meal together okay Taylor's down first thing let's drain it and what we want to do is get sorry get all the moisture out that's pretty good but then single mesh now if you want to make your match really spectacularly good as I said you gotta have your butter grab an ad get rid of the wife just well we wants the yolk drop in grab butter in and you'll end up with a much more creamy luxurious result it's an old trick the people doing there on the farms in the country that most people forgotten now but you can drop an egg yolk in it makes all the difference remember that puts just fabulous practical probably take a bit more butter gets too much butter it's never enough and then we just need some salt and pepper to taste what Panther preferably okay now right ready to assemble
