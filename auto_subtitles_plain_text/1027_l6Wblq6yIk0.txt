 [Music] healthy General Tso's chicken hi this is Jayden from steamy kitchen comm it's one of the most popular dishes in Chinese American restaurants but strangely enough it's not found in China it was named after General Joe of the Ching dynasty in the 1800s but the dish wasn't invented until about a hundred years later by a Taiwanese chef who opened a restaurant in New York according to fuchsia Dunlop the favorite dish the favorite Chinese dish of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is general toast chicken and I'm going to quote this it is described as a quote stir-fried masterpiece sizzling hot and both flavor and temperature well there are two things I think about when my husband orders general Jones chicken at a restaurant I have never ordered it but when you ordered that I think of two things deep fried and heavy so my version which i think is a stir-fried masterpiece is going to be much healthier no deep-frying and it's going to be a beautiful beautiful sauce you can make it as spicy as you want let's make the sauce first in a bowl add soy sauce rice vinegar or white vinegar honey chili garlic sauce chicken broth and cornstarch kind of whisk that all together and we're going to set that aside next cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces and toss with cornstarch and a little grind of freshly ground black pepper mix well so every single piece of chicken is coated this cornstarch is gonna give your chicken a really nice crust without deep frying now for the aromatics I've got minced ginger garlic that I'm gonna grate on a rasp grater it makes it just easier to cut up and mince and green onions chop the broccoli into small florets but don't throw away the stalks this is what I do cut off the tough end discard that and use your knife to take off the outer section of the stock which is a lot tougher and very difficult to eat what you're left with is actually really really tender stock I cut these into small piece now we're ready to cook we're going to steam the broccoli with a bit of boiling water for two minutes the broccoli should still be slightly crunchy yet tender and cooked drain the broccoli rinse with cool water to stop the cooking and set aside return your pan or wok to the stove and dry really really well because you're going to add oil and next turn your heat to high and when it's hot go ahead and swirl in the cooking oil making sure that oil covers as much surface as possible add the chicken but you're gonna do this in stages you don't want to over crawl the chicken because you want the chicken to have enough room to Brown nicely so I'm doing this in two batches I'm adding the chicken in a single layer and here's the important stuff leave it alone you have a time to brown and then flip the chicken over see that nice golden crust you can't get that if you keep trying to stir and move the chicken about flip the chicken over let it cook another couple of minutes to brown the other side and then remove those chicken pieces they're only halfway cooked if that's perfect what you want to do is remove the chicken that is browned on both sides to a separate Bowl and as you remove the chicken continually add more raw chicken to the pan to cook patience do not overcrowd once you're done with all the chicken keep the wok on the stove and now it's turn down the heat so that we don't burn the aromatics which is the green onion garlic and ginger then pour in the sauce that we made earlier stir fry for about 30 seconds until your kitchen smells wonderful bring to a simmer and then add back in the half cooked chicken and the steamed broccoli toss really well until everything's coated through let it cook for another minute and that is it sprinkle with sesame seeds and you're ready to serve easy right for the full recipe or if you have any questions at all head over to steamy kitchen duck comm / 165 my cookbook steamy kitchens healthy Asian favorites is available at all book stores including amazon.com
