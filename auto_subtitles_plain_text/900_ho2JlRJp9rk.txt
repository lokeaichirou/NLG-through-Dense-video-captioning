 hey guys stop by ballistic BBQ today Cajun burger let's get going all right so the inspiration for creating a cajun burger actually came from a variety of sauces and seasonings that was sent to me by Keith Jenkins over there a frog bone Keith is a great guy and he's become a pretty much a good buddy to all of us barbecuers on the youtube so anyway we're gonna start off with the patty what I've done here is I've taken about a pound of beef short rib and I've grounded up with two lengths of andouille sausage so what I did was I sliced the Unduli up into little pieces and I alternated beef and Dewey beef and Dewey then I loosely toss it up just to make sure it got nice and incorporated here so let's make some patties what I'm going to do is take what I'm guesstimating to be about a third of a pound and I'm just going to form these into fairly loose patties some Dewey smells really really good a nice smoky smell going on all right there we go now I want layers of flavor to be in this now there's a lot of flavor going on inside this beef patty but what I want to do is season the outside let me wash my hands and we'll get to the seasoning all right so when I was looking at the pack of seasonings first thing it jumped out at me was the blackened seasoning put out my frog bone smells really really good and I think it's going to be a great complement to this beef and me and Dewey so I'm going to go ahead and give this nice good seasoning on top I'll flip it get to the other side I got the grill heating up outside so I will meet you out there all right guys so since I'm going to be blackening the seasoning on this beef I'm gonna be using my flattop today got the Cray quart cast-iron skillet insert in here throw a surprise that year a little bit later let's get this patty on right so you can see beefs getting cooked up along the side we're gonna go ahead and give this a flint that's what I wanted to see that nice kind of blackened seasoning there I'm gonna go ahead and throw on slice of sharp cheddar cheese okay now the oil what I have here are some very thinly sliced onion mixed in with some pickled jalapeno then I poured in a little bit of that jalapeno juice kind of cut all the onions and everything going to toss it in some seasoning this is just some white flour seasoned with frog bones all person all-purpose seasoning [Music] while that's going we're going to go ahead and get these buns toasted nice toast on the bun alright as you can see beautiful color on those onions and the jalapenos get these on some paper towels all right Patty's done let's put together a cajun burger guys all right the first thing we're to do is lay down some lettuce and I'm using butter lettuce I'm going to lay down a couple very thinly sliced pieces of tomato you know that beautiful seasoned patty just very hot right now all right now that rum a lot this is the roulade sauce that frog bone puts out and those onions and jalapenos now the bread is just toasted with butter I love that it really brings out some great flavor in the hamburger and there we go guys let's give it a try this is gonna be a messy one stand by Wow there's some heat here that's not too much that run allowed sauce is perfect for hamburger and I knew it would be when I tried it so I was really excited about this burger you can't go wrong with fried onions and jalapenos and again that blackened seasoning yeah there's some Cajun going on here guys anyway thanks for stopping by definitely go check out frog bones YouTube channel and website I'll post links down below cheers guys
