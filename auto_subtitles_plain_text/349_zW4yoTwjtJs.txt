 hi everyone today I'll show you how to make a marinade meat dish called Chi being Korean I used beef ribs for this video but you can use a pork ribs also it takes time to marinate the meat but otherwise it is very simple and easy to make soak 2 and half pounds of beef ribs in water for about 2 or 3 hours to get rid of the plot change the water every 1 hour when it gets blood like this 2 or 3 hours later rinse the ribs and drain the water you could one a zapper in half of an onion grind them together in a mixer pour the pear and onion mixture into the beef ribs mix well and set it aside for an hour this will have to get rid of the bad meat flavor and make it sweet and tender in a bowl combine all of the ingredients for the sauce mix well onto those sugar and honey desserts one hour later pour the sauce mixture on the beef ribs and mix well cover it with plastic wrap and marinated Friday in the refrigerator flip over all the ribs once or twice while it's marinating on a heated pan or grill grill some pieces of marinated beef ribs with some extra sauce cook them onto the reef slaw well done we enjoyed eating this copy very much so I hope you can enjoy this copy as much as we T thank you for watching see you soon again bye
