 dr. G here with natural foods diet org today I'm going to show you how to make a simple fermented food it's a sauerkraut one of the original traditional fermented foods now why do we want to eat fermented foods well briefly the lacto-fermentation process makes the vegetables more digestible it preserves them so let's say that power grid goes out well we don't need to refrigerate these foods or if you refrigerate them they love they last a lot longer so the lacto-fermentation creates an acidic environment that doesn't allow pathogens to grow so it improves the digestibility it preserves the food as well plus it reduces the sugar content of vegetables because the lactobacillus feed on the sugar so it makes the food less of a glycemic load for those with diabetes or prediabetes so today we're going to take a cabbage we want to take a fresh cabbage I got this from the farmers market organically grown I guess maybe not fresh but will peel off this dead outer layer rivo revealing the cabbage remember cabbage has many beneficial nutrients and we make them more bioavailable we want to cut out the stem so we slice out the stem like this we want to save this organic material to put in our compost we want to be efficient and we want to create a sustainable food processing environment so we just slice up the cabbage which is very simple you take the cabbage and we slice it into thin sections if you've ever eaten sour kraut sauerkraut tends to be in thin long strips generally although you can do it any way you like next we want to take our shredded cabbage and put it into a large bowl so we'll do that all right so we have the cabbage in our bowl so we take the bowl and next we want to add sea salt so we add some sea salt sprinkle it in for one cabbage about one tablespoon of sea salt and so here we have a nice bowl full of cabbage and what we're going to do is squeeze the cabbage with our hands and we're squeezing the cabbage to get the juices out of it and this is also a very good exercise I think it burns about 900 calories a minute actually not quite that many but I'm sure this burns lots of cabbage squeezing burns lots of calories squeezing this cabbage so we want to squeeze it for about 5 minutes next thing we want to do is transfer the cabbage into our jar and so we get some of the liquid here as well as our cabbage and we place it in the jar we press it down now we put in about a tablespoon of sea salt now in addition to what this what the salt does is salt inhibits the growth of the pathogenic bacteria and that's how ancestrally they preserve food with salt and so it does the same thing here now one of the things we can do to add lactobacillus to our mix here is remember we had a video on making way well we take the way that we made ourselves from raw goat's milk we take the way which we want to add exactly three tablespoons or maybe two tablespoons or maybe four tablespoons or we could do like I do and just kind of pour some and guess that it's three or four tablespoons like that and so we'd be sure be sure the top of the Kaveri is covered with liquid as long as the cabbage is submerged beneath the surface of the liquid then we don't have to worry about too much oxygen given in but in order to prevent oxygen from given in the other thing that we use is we use an airtight seal on our jar so what we'll do is we will fill the liquid up about a half an inch above the surface of the cabbage then we'll seal this in our airtight container then we will set this on the counter at room temperature and usually about three days leave it out for about three days and you can open it up and sample it and see if it's ready and then you would put it in the refrigerator now the thing about eating foods like sauerkraut and other fermented foods is they are more of a condiment they're like eating a superfood so we're not going to have a plate piled high of sauerkraut and that's our main meal and that's why a small amount like this can last for several months because we have a small dish of sauerkraut to eat our digestion to act as a probiotic so why don't you try this this is dirt simple as I just showed you it takes just a few minutes it breaks you from the umbilical cord of our modern food processing this is dr.
