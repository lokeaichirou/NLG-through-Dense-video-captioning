 hi i'm jeremy soule from Island Creek oyster bar today we're gonna talk about one of my favorite fish cod there's two kinds of cod that are generally available one is Pacific cod which has a similar appearance to Atlantic cod Pacific cod is caught mostly in Alaska now it's one of the largest commercial catches available in Alaska Atlantic cod is a fish that's identified with New England and ranges from Greenland down in North Carolina they look similar and that's how the Pacific cod got his name cod because of similary and appearance but they are not the same fish Atlantic cod is a little more prized has a beautiful silky texture a larger flake Pacific cod is a little firmer texture and a little different color if you're buying real cod you want to make sure that you're buying Cod from the Northeast and now we're going to make fish and chips with Atlantic cod first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take our Cod that we already have cut we're gonna soak that in buttermilk gonna add a little bit it's basket to the buttermilk I won't make it spicy but it adds a nice flavor mix that around and then just go ahead and set your Cod right in the buttermilk we're gonna let that soak for about an hour so our constant soaking for about an hour we're gonna get our flour ready by seasoning it up we're gonna add a little bit of cayenne paprika and dry mustard stir that in we're gonna dredge our Cod right in the flour and put it in the fryer 1 wait sure it's coated all over but then we're gonna shake off any excess right in the fryer our Cod been frying for a few minutes I think it's ready yeah it looks great nice and golden-brown you want to give it a few minutes to get nice and crispy we're gonna remove it to a paper towel put some the oil drain off it's on the paper trail we're gonna see some rule salt and pepper go right on top of our crispy fries we're gonna garnish with a little bit of lemon wedge and there we have it Atlantic cod fish and chips
