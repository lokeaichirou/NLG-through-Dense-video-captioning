 hey what's up guys today I'm going to show you how to make a very easy and delicious spaghetti and meatball recipe so first up you're going to grab a bowl and put some ground meat into it here I'm using ground pork you can use ground turkey chicken or beef it's really your preference next you're going to add your chopped up parsley then subtract up garlic here I'm using whole-wheat bread crumbs you can use again really whatever bread crumbs that you desire then next I'm going to add some shaved parmesan cheese some chili powder some oregano and some chili flakes once you're done adding all these ingredients just give it a really good solid mix making sure that all the ingredients that they're breadcrumbs are absorbed in with the meat and then you're going to start forming your meatballs alright so when you start forming your meatballs you're going to want to compress the meat in the beginning in between your hands allowing it to really become one solid mass and as you start rolling you want to sort of loosen your grip just so you have a really nice smooth meatball and this will prevent any large cracks from running through the center of that meat which in turn will prevent your meatballs from falling apart as you cook them once you're done forming all your meatballs these are about an ounce and a half a piece you're going to want to get a large saute pan on high heat with some olive oil in there and then seria meatballs for about five minutes or so until they turn really nice and golden brown all right so once your meatballs have a proper sear on them you're going to add some chopped up raw garlic to the pan give it a few shakes and then you're going to add your tomato puree followed by some salt pepper some dry oregano and some brown sugar and then you're going to finish it off with some tomato paste and a good helping of olive oil give this a few stirs and then you're going to let this reduce for a solid hour on low heat once your meatballs are done you're going to have a pot of boiling water going and generously season it with some salt drop your spaghetti pasta in there and you're going to cook this for about five to seven minutes until the pasta is nice and al dente then you're going to give it a good strain and then coat the pasta and a generous helping of olive oil so that the noodles don't stick together and then we're going to plate this up alright so when you plate the pasta just gently lay it on the plate using almost like a twisting motion and this will give the pasta almost like a spiral weaved look and help give it some body as well after that you're gonna generously spoon some of the sauce over the top of the pasta along with the meatballs and then you're going to generously top all of this with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese and then I like to use some freshly picked basil leaves just the smaller leaves off of the plant and it gives it just a beautiful pop of green to this beautiful dish and all there is to do is enjoy this with your friends and family and have a wonderful dinner here you go my dear this is a spaghetti enemy divine enemy the BA hmm mmm there's a good sign so far mm-hmm so first we need a little pasta that's a big bite was it yeah it takes a while right you got to come in when you're eating expanding you do this is true you have to commit you got to commit you take like a wimpy bite you sometimes people make meatballs like huge these are not too big so I just got mine a half and we have leftover so I think we should make meatballs allows oh yeah doesn't that sound good yeah it does oh my word so what'd you think I think it's perfect pretty good yeah and I love it's like slightly spicy yes I make my meatballs this is like you have a little bit of spice with the chili flake and some chili powder so I was thinking we should have that moment what's that move that Disney movie or we both like have one end of the spaghetti no the lady in the trash yeah oh we need to have a lady in the  movie than I like nudge the movie than I like nudge the meatball over to you on abiquiu yeah probably not gonna happen though well good job good two thumbs up four stars Rachel's LA Times article yeah yeah for sure awesome it's good really good hopefully you guys enjoyed it I know everybody has their like you know Mama's spaghetti recipe everybody has their own like tailor-made spaghetti recipe this is mine hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did please thumbs up and subscribe and as always I'll have the full recipe broken down written format on my website so if you guys you know prefer that you can go check it out Byron Talbott calm and I'll see you guys next time with another fantastic recipe bye everybody you
