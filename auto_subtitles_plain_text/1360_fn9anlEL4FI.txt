 welcome back once again to how to cook great food calm if you haven't already click that button and subscribe to our Channel only menu today we'll be making a lamb and potato curry or masala as you can see I've got my pan here and in there I've got some oil that's heating up nicely I'm using the sunflower oil go ahead and use any oil you like we're going to drop in some whole seeds or garam masala so here they go you want them to roast some pop and crackle there's a baby fear I've got in there some fennel seeds cumin seeds green cardamom black mustard seeds I thought I need to integrate with it they'll get a release of wonderful flavor into that oil now we're going to go in with our lamb we're going to fry this for about five or six minutes just with the whole garam masala give me know this lamb has got Bolognese you can use spinach if you want so let's just cook this let it play for about five or six minutes sell it over I'm on a kind of above medium heat we'll just seal it a little bit and then we're going to add of course lots of other lovely spices you can see that our meat is browning really nicely I mean it is nowhere near Krypton that's what we've got to do now is to get this meat nice and tender what I'll do here is I'm going to add some garlic ginger paste that's a 50/50 mix of garlic and ginger it's about three of these little teaspoons in there you're going to add some chopped onions I'm using a red onion but go ahead and use white then we're going to add some powders as always if you've watched the channel I call these the big four they're equal parts of chilli coriander cumin and turmeric if you'd like of course you can use your favorite curry powder we're going to add some salt at this stage let's get this over and again we're going to just cook this for about now three or four minutes turning it constantly again on a kind of above medium heat because some lovely flavors happening now now we're going to add some water that was cold water by the way you know we're just sort of covering it a little bit you know we're going to bring this water to the boil and then we're going to simmer this with a lid on for about 15 minutes this is the part that I hope generally works will tenderize our meat and make it nice and soft so let's take a look now some of that steam out of it this is cooking down beautifully and as you can see here that it needs to come straight off of that bone if certainly on its way now pretty essential part of doing this dish is to get your meat nice and tender as you getting that with an awful awful tough meat no matter what cut you use or maybe book really expensive lamb it would still end up being tough if you don't go through this process I'm not going to add some potatoes which I've peeled and shot these are fairly small you cut them however you like and the cooking process lets you take the longer time if you put them in much bigger so again let's give this a mix stir them in we still put a decent amount of moisture in there from that water if you haven't at this point maybe it's got really dry add a bit more water now it's going to go back on and we're going to cook this for about seven to eight minutes on a fairly low heat not a simmer above a simmer okay let's jump in now to take a look that's looking more like it potatoes and cooking very nicely I kind of like my potatoes Squaresoft and now at this stage is going to add some chopped tomatoes I'm just going to spread them on the top I pop the lid back on on a fairly low heat we're going to cook them just for about five minutes what they should do is break down with the steam dogs third room at the moment the steam will break them down we're going to mix it around once and come back we may add a little tad more water perhaps and then we're pretty much done oh we should be now at the final stage let's take a look yeah these are softening really nicely as you can see and they've given off a little bit of moisture as well just now turn this over at this stage I'm going to add some fresh chili it's totally optional as to how much you put in I've put in about four or five there you now need to check this for salt it's all good for me you can if you want finish that up with some fresh coriander or cilantro let's just cook that for about two more minutes and it's done it's wonderful I'm really happy with it I'll see you again soon take it you
