 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the ultimate mashed potatoes that's right this is dedicated to everyone who's posting a no fat or low-fat mashed potato recipe for the holidays please food gods forgive them for they know not what they do because not only our holiday table mashed potato is supposed to have butter in it they're supposed to have a ridiculous amount of butter in it so that's exactly what I'm gonna show you how to do but fair warning what you're about to witness can never be unseen but if you think you're up for it let's get started and one huge tip here make sure you get potatoes they're the same size all right all three of these potatoes were just over a pound each which means once I trim them I'm gonna have about three pounds of potatoes to work with which is gonna make about eight generous portions and then once those are peeled we're gonna quarter them and to do that we'll cut it in half and by the way if the potato tapers a little bit I always cut the tapered end a little longer see that I didn't go exactly in half all right that'll compensate a little bit for the difference in girth so we'll cut them in half we'll cut those halves in half and that's a pretty good method for getting even sized pieces by the way in our original mashed potato video we cut them in half lengthwise but we've updated and then once those potatoes are cut we're gonna rinse them very thoroughly in fact you may have noticed a little dirt on my fingers when I'm peeling and cutting those I only rinsed my potatoes once because you have to rinse the starch off when they're cut anyway why bother rinsing them before you peel them that's like double in your work and yes it was a long way to go to explain that little spot of dirt on my finger okay so once those are rinse thoroughly we're gonna drain them and dump them into our pot of cold water that we're gonna generously salt by the way like very generously so our ultimate match pairs are actually gonna start off season and we'll go ahead and bring that up to a boil on the highest heat possible and then we'll adjust our heat to maintain a nice steady simmer and we'll cook these until perfectly tender and since that's gonna take a little while we can go ahead and prep our butter and I hope you're sitting down because that's how much we're gonna use that is one pound of European butter also known as the expensive butter but it is gorgeous very low water content it almost has a clay-like texture but anyway we're gonna take a pound of butter we're gonna cut it up in chunks and it's very critical this butter comes up to room temperature it would be perfect if this butter got up to like sixty sixty-five degrees and I'm not sure if you've crunched the numbers yet but yes we're doing a three-to-one ratio 3 pounds of potatoes to 1 pound of butter and I realize that sounds completely insane but I'm the blogpost I'm gonna explain why that's not only not insane but it is an incredibly rational an absolutely reasonable thing to do so please check that out especially if you're a fan of airtight arguments all right so our butters prepped and we'll head back over to the stove to check our potatoes and we really want these to be tender all right so carefully check with a spoon and a knife that knife should go in with almost no effort I mean there's just nothing more evil than mashed potatoes with chunks of uncooked potato in it yes worse than Satan way worse so we're gonna make sure these are very tender at that point we're gonna drain them very thoroughly we don't want any water in here and yes if they've been cooked enough they're gonna collapse like that that does not mean they're overcooked that means they're perfectly cooked all right so we're gonna dump in our very well drained potatoes we're gonna turn our heat on to medium low we definitely want to keep some heat under this and we're gonna start mashing with a wire potato masher all right check it out accept no substitutes the old wire potato masher nothing works as good and during this first phase all we're doing is breaking them up all right there's no butter there's no milk just go around until you think they're mashed oh and by the way one of the great things about having this much butter in the recipe you don't really have to worry about over mixing okay so do not be concerned you're overworking this it's gonna be perfect all right so after that initial mashing we'll go ahead and dump in some pepper and some salt and we're gonna adjust the seasoning later but I know I'm gonna need some and we'll also throw in about a quarter of the butter chunks and we'll go ahead and mix that up with the masher until the butter just about disappears and by the way do not forget throughout this entire process your heat is on medium low we want to keep everything nice and hot don't forget that butters only room temperature and once that first addition of butter is mashed in we're gonna switch to a wire whisk we're gonna dump it another quarter of the butter we're gonna mix that in with the whisk when it almost disappears at the next quarter of butter and simply repeat until all the butter is gone so in a way this is almost like we're doing a butter sauce where we're mixing in the butter and it's kind of emulsifying in and you'll notice when you get down to that last addition of butter things are getting really light and creamy and awesome looking and then when that last addition of butter is whipped in we're gonna go ahead and finish this with just a splash of hot milk just like a quarter cup I microwaved mine and that's just gonna lighten up and loosen things up just to touch and we'll give that one last whipping and at this point you're really really gonna want to grab a fork nately to taste one of the most delicious things in the history of the universe but you have to taste and adjust the season at this points listen to me now and hear me later if this does not have enough salt it will not taste good alright so mine was almost perfect but it did need a little more salt and the obligatory shake of cayenne and once that's mixed in we can go ahead and turn off our heat and serve so go ahead and transfer those into your tater Bowl do not garnish with anything except possibly a few chives and that's only if you're taking pictures this needs absolutely nothing especially if you're serving it as part of a big holiday meal and yes when you bring that to the table people will be thinking hmm those mashed potatoes aren't white they're almost butter colored that's probably just the light I'm sure it doesn't look that way from insane amounts of butter oh but it does and seriously one taste and it will all make sense it is just beyond description and there's a reason all those Michelin star chefs make their potatoes this way because they're just so above and beyond well we usually enjoys mashed potatoes that they almost become another type of food some kind of butter potato hybrid but tato actually let me work on that so if you're into enjoying and sharing with your guest a proper bowl of mashed potatoes this holiday season I really hope you give these a try head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
