 [Music] chart beeps it's Nadia again this one is a special one to me because I am from Rome and it's something that we eat very often there which is the carbonara spaghetti now you can make spaghetti carbonara or you can make rigatoni alla Carbonara whichever way they taste awesome and it's a dish that is typical of my region which is the last year region and it's very very simple there is certain ingredients that you must must must have to make sure that is that it comes out as tasty as it should be for this recipe you need one schoiar which is a form of bacon or gas sandwich is the cheek of the pig but pancetta is an OK substitute for it you will get a very tasty carbonara with this the next ingredient that is a must is a curry no cheese you can look down below in the description and I've spelt it you can find the greener in these supermarkets here I have pecorino romano typical Roman pecorino there's different types of big arenas if you can find a Karina Romano is the best so we've got abaranda grams of pancetta 80 grams of pecorino 3 eggs black pepper and 200 grams of spaghetti now these quantities are for two people usually for the carbonara you put one egg for each person so one and water 1 egg 400 grams of spaghetti is for one person I put three eggs because one gets less than the pot so is one of each and one for the pot and the water is boiling we are going to start with the first step of the carbonara you take the pancetta you put it all inside the pan with nothing else it's got fats in it so you don't need to add oil something else and you just let it sizzle a little well the bunch of that sizzling I'm going to get cracking literally with the eggs so I'm taking a little bowl and putting the three eggs you add the 80 grams of pecorino you get very generous with the better so that's gonna be about half a teaspoon so now we're going to travel to a pinch of salt which I forgot earlier behave I am not perfect so now you don't have too much salt because the pancetta is salty okay so we're going to put half a teaspoon of salt you get a fork and you get cracking now guys this is a simple as you see there's nothing else involved no creamy no single cream addition no milk no nothing this is the original tasty carbonara the you've tasted in the Italian restaurants and one important thing do not put parmesan in the carbonara it is not the right type of cheese it will give you a completely different taste now you see the pancetta is giving out all the night sorry oil is giving out all the nice oil that you want because you're going to use this pancetta and put it in the egg mix and then keep the pan for later because we're going to put some spaghetti in it to get all the nice little sauce and juice I guess that came out of the vinsetta mixed with it so keep the band or washer right ready don't try this at all this is something I just learned [Music] that's right okay I almost got it anyway this is a ninja Roman exercises nah when the pancetta goes slightly crispy as you can see you are done so we're going to add this to the egg mix okay let's do it okay you see this oil from the pancetta we're going to take advantage of these so once use the pan or gun put don't put away your pan or wash it because once the spaghetti have cooked we're going to dip them in just to get all the last bits of oil now you want to make sure that you take the spaghetti out Capel of minutes before the end of the cooking time so if it's 10 minutes you dig them up at 8 minutes so that when you keep mixing them with the egg and the pancetta even though there's they're hot and they're still cooking they're not going to go all mushy just wanted to show you you've got a bunch of the bits in a you give it a nice stir again okay you want all those oils and taste to mix into the egg and the pecorino with the pepper and the salt everything together married can nice cap [Music] we wanna the Instagram color how exciting so now this is down guys we're going to put this pasta inside the pan that we used earlier so that all the stuff gets mixed you're good shaky shaky shaky I want the spaghetti to catch everything that was left from our and the work that we did earlier so now we're good plan our mix to it [Music] camera also take some of the spaghetti I want to get everything that I've used today I'm not gonna leave anything [Music] anybody okay spoon and fork let's get cracking so you want to mix this okay this is all done of the cooker you don't want to cook this but this pocket is hot so if you keep mixing it for good five minutes it will cook just enough as the carbonara needs to be cooked as doctors are not sure anyways I am always right because I am NOT English so when I make a mistake no one can tell me anything anyways guys I need you to look at this who carried this is developing into something spectacular look at this I'm mixing it okay this is like the work of God himself and you wanna mix it until it's cool but not fried that you don't want to fry the egg come on guys let's get going okay this is just perfect disease it smells like this is delicious this is pretty much done guys I love you I love you whoo we're going to put it in a plate so I'm rolling it and then I'm like going into the sent letter letting it fall yes realized guys that we haven't used any cream sauce but these simple ingredients have created a cream of the room for the final touch of coarse black pepper lovers you want to sprinkle it you want to give it a nice touch all right it's done please take a picture of this they got that on your screens this is just amazing [Music] so now is the final test as usual my own it does smell good and I just want to check on this consistency it's absolutely perfect it
