 hey there and welcome to another episode of cooking with Jah I'm John and this is my cooking show this week we're gonna be making something that is actually really simple to eat it's very delicious you can do it either in the oven in the grill and you can pretty much make this any way you want today we're gonna be making chicken teriyaki shish kebabs I've got four chicken breasts red pepper green pepper jalapeno cos Nikki likes it spicy as well as a red onion I'm also going to be using wooden skewers which are about a foot long you can do this one of two ways you can either mix all your ingredients together teriyaki sauce put them on the skewer thrown right on the grill but today I'm actually going to be letting a marinade for about an hour and the teriyaki sauce and that way I'll have flavor just kind of get saturated right into the meat right into the vegetables I'm also going to be soaking my excuse in cold water for Oh about half an hour so when I put the kebab on the grill the wood will burn right away it will be really moist it'd be really wet and it'll absorb a lot of heat dry out before it starts to just burn right away all right so the first thing that we're gonna do is take our red onion and just cut it into quarters I've already cleaned out the inside of the peppers you want to get all the seeds out the stem and all sorts of stuff in there and again we're just gonna cut this in half and set it aside same with the green pepper now we've really just kind of want Chuck so you can cut this in thirds and then again in two pieces so we have nice little pieces of red pepper that we can stick on our shish kebob and the same with the green pepper cut it in thirds and then cut your chunks into three pieces and all this is getting set aside in a pan that I will mix all my vegetables I've been with the chicken and the teriyaki sauce I actually switched to a bigger pan because I have a lot of vegetables and next we take our red onion and we don't need to do anything else except just pull it apart and pull that layer off gonna pull it apart and we'll just throw it in chunk by chunk and this will be what you actually throw on the skewer now we're gonna cut up the jalapeno yeah we're just gonna go ahead cut that into quarters and we'll just do a couple pieces put on the skewers just like that okay and next we're gonna slice our chicken into chunks and you can cut the larger part of the breasts a half I like to cut the tip off because it's kind of a smaller piece and once we cut the larger part of the breast in half we're just gonna cut the chicken into nice small chunks so it'll fit on our skewer with our vegetables you can go ahead and throw those in with the vegetables everything's gonna get cooked so it doesn't matter that is touching the raw chicken and when we're done with this we're gonna go ahead and we're just gonna add teriyaki sauce to the chicken and the vegetables and we're gonna mix it all up and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour it now comes the fun part where we get to add our teriyaki to the vegetables and the chicken sometimes it comes out pretty slow but I'm gonna go ahead and use a whole bottle this is a lot of chicken and a lot of vegetables and now we just take all this and we mix it up by hand we just kind of massage the teriyaki sauce into the vegetables head into the chicken make sure you get every single piece in there work it real good and just get a good coating on the vegetables and on the chicken I like this particular chair chicken teriyaki sauce I'm not exactly sure what brand it is but it's pretty sticky it's not very runny and it sticks to all the chicken and all the vegetables really well and you want to make sure that you really get in you know side the pieces of pepper like this you have a corner just you want to make sure you get all that teriyaki sauce in and around the whole pepper and I've spent about five minutes just really slowly but surely mixing up all the vegetables all the chicken all the teriyaki sauce I want to make sure that this stuff is just full of flavor and as you can tell iris is really really excited about this at all I'm gonna use as a shallow baking sheet it's about half an inch thick it's about a quarter-inch full of water and the sticks will absorb a little bit of water but not much you just need to make sure you have a pan that's long enough to hold the skewers so our skewers have been soaking for about 45 minutes the meat the vegetables and the teriyaki sauce have been also marinating for about 45 minutes we're gonna go ahead put them all on the skewers and then take them out to the barbecue grill and start feeling I'm just going to show you one or two of these and you do the same thing for everyone so you basically you start any way you want I like to go onion green pepper red pepper chicken and we'll try to find a nice little piece of jalapeno and I like to put the jalapeno next to the chicken so the chick will actually absorb a little bit of that spicy heat and then we just repeat the process we go onion green pepper red pepper chicken jalapeno and the jalapenos is a it's a little bit smaller of a piece of pepper so you basically you just want to turn a skewer slowly on the jalapeno take it all the way through and that'll poke a nice little hole through there onion green pepper red pepper chicken jalapeno then we'll go ahead and top it off with an onion one thing you also want to be careful about is that you don't poke yourself with the skewer these are very very sharp and if you run it into your hand you're probably gonna end up poking yourself so bad that you bleed I have a pan here I'm just going to take them and I'm actually just gonna set them across the pan like that all right so we got nine shish kebabs out of that we're gonna go ahead we're gonna throw them on the grill for oh I don't know 10 to 20 minutes until the chicken is nice and cooked and the vegetables are soft and delicious all right the grill is hot the kebabs are skewered and I've got a nice cold beer if you're 21 years of age or older in the United States there's nothing better then drinking a nice cold one will you do a little grilling so we're just gonna take our kebabs we're gonna put them on a red-hot grill side by side all the way across and a lot of times when I'm grilling I'll leave the dogs inside because I don't want them to accidentally get burned they really would not appreciate that we have our teriyaki chicken shish kebabs on the grill well do them on about five minutes aside we'll flip them five minutes flip them five minutes put in five minutes and they'll be on for about 20 minutes I'm gonna cover them for the first 10 minutes to keep all that heat inside and let me tell you what these are going to be absolutely delicious later they've been on for 15 minutes I think they're done we're gonna go ahead and take them off you can see we're getting a lot of just nice char there all the chicken looks nice and done I would take them off put them in my pan and then we're gonna enjoy and there is the final product and I like to pull all the ingredients off of the skewer you can leave it on if you want but let's go ahead and give it a try and see how it tastes mmm that chicken is delicious has such a great combination of flavors and let me tell you what you
