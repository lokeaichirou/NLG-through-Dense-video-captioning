 hi guys what we're going to be cooking today is a beautiful Italian classic minestrone soup [Music] okay minestrone soup absolutely beautiful Italian classic basically it's a large vegetable soup very easy to make very cheap there's a lot of variations of it and basically minestrone means big soup slice of the celery neck /uk up and leave the skin on a lot of flavoring that skin slashing mushrooms and when you slice him took your two fingers back there and put your middle finger forward took your nails in and use this posi guide so when you slice you can't chop your fingers off and it's safe well if you feel uncomfortable chopping or slicing anything like that just put it in half so it's all flat again it took you two fingers back middle finger up tucked in like that cuz when you've got your fingers like that and your nails tucked in and use that as a guide so when you chop in fast or slow there's no way you're gonna chop your fingers up so I do this it's all safe and if you cut in anything long like a carrot or a celery get made sometimes I don't do it but you get your thumb like that to hold it get your fingers again tucked back and your middle finger in front and then just chop just like that like a guide next I'm gonna be using one potato very traditionally minestrone soup I'm just going to dice it I'm using some beautiful sun-dried tomatoes so that's roughly chopped then let's just shred some cabbage test I'm going to be using some beautiful nice cauliflower florets I'm gonna be using some beautiful good-quality smoky ham you can use pancetta but um this is really good quality beautiful which gives it a nice smoky taste cuz he's smoky huh just white your garlic and just leave that whole okay I've got a heavy bass pan really heavy really good for making soup like this on a medium heat we're gonna add some olive oil and plenty of that in okay so what we're going to add is the onion carrots mushrooms celery [Music] next up the ham in next up the potatoes and cauliflower and some dried tomatoes in on the cabbage and also it's very important for this soup is seasoned as you go so I'd a good generous pinch of salt and also some pepper give everything a good stir and you really want to cook all this out for about 15 minutes to get some really good color on there caramelize it like a little bit because this is the heart and soul of the soup so really really stir it cookie down and add your liquid [Music] okay this been cooking for like five minutes and it smells awfully fantastic so put some dried herbs in there when you put some more Reggiano in there basil dried basil give it a stir mmm okay that's mean cook in ten minutes and like I said it's very important to get all these sweated out get all the flavors out and the next one we do add some really good quality Tomatoes now give that a stir also add some peas some sweet peas this gives it a really beautiful sweetness next at a good quality chicken stock either on mate or from the store I'm also adding some water and one of the secrets to this dish I'm gonna use some parmesan rind and that just lifts the dish that just makes it extra extra special so just pop that in and the secret to this dish is we're going to put it in the oven we're gonna cook it for two hours and what that will do that will intensify all the flavors and it's gonna be fantastic support later on I'm gonna put it in the oven [Music] okay this has been cooking for one hour so remove the lid and that it's more absolutely beautiful it's really well worth it and warm and some flavors in there it's an X just add one cup of water and then put it back in the oven let's have a look at this look at that guys you know it's well worth it you know to cook it for a long long time and the maximum flavor I've got out of those vegetables that broth everything is beautiful sort of taste Wow a parmesan rind you can really taste it I've taken it out so now what we're gonna do we're gonna add some parsley gonna add some peas to that some salt I know I need salt ground black pepper also at the park or rigatoni and that will continue cooking in the soup so give everything a good stir mmm beautiful [Music] harshly oh man some fresh garlic just on top and definitely some beautiful grated Parmesan cheese just on top ground black pepper and just a drizzle of olive oil around there and also what's really good with minestrone is some beautiful white fish seven table so there you go guys hope you enjoyed it absolutely one of my favorite soups of all time easy to do you can add anything you want in there but the secret is is just to cook it for a long long time thanks guys [Music]
