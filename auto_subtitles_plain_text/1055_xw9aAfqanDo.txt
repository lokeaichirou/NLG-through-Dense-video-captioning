 hey everyone it's rocky I'm here with my friends from fav diets calm and today we're making a holiday classic the Waldorf salad and I'm actually gonna make a chicken Waldorf salad because this is something I plan to have for dinner tonight so I wanted to add a little bit more to it but this is a good one to make for your holiday table for that big dinner or actually make for a brunch cuz it really hits all those notes it hits the sweet the savory it's crunchy and it's super easy the only thing we're gonna be using the oven for is to toast up some walnuts so let's get started so right now I'm just going to be prepping my vegetables and my fruit just have some grapes right here some red seedless grapes I'm just gonna cut in half and as I'm going I'm just tossing them into my salad bowl I'm chopping up some celery so now I'm just gonna dice up some apples now that I have my apple in the bowl I'm gonna go ahead and squeeze some lemon over it and it's just going to prevent this prevent it from browning I'm also chopping up some dried cranberries to toss like a salad and I'm just gonna add a nice sweetness and also a tangy sourness I have a skillet set it about medium heat I'm just gonna toss in some walnuts and get them toasted up basically when you start smelling them that's when they're done you want to keep a close eye on them because you don't want them to burn all right I'm gonna see if I can flip them like all those professional chefs do hope they hopefully they don't all end up on the floor all right that was close I'm gonna give myself a couple of points for that okay I think that that one take them off the heat all right here's our toasted walnuts just gonna give them a rough chop I'm not gonna toss them in the salad right right away cuz I want them to get soggy but I do it just want to get them chopped and out of the way all right now I'm to the dressing right now in that measuring cup I have some Greek yogurt and I'm gonna put in some light mix I'm gonna add some agave nectar another mix I'm also going to put in a little bit of cracked black pepper yeah give this a little mix around give it a taste this is good all right let's start assembling our salad you he goes and I'm gonna put a couple of dollops of this dressing on and mix this around well I get all the flavors incorporated you this is so good guys it's sweet its savory its crunchy its tangy I'm so glad we didn't go overboard on the dressing because you can definitely taste the individual ingredients that we have on here in here perfectly in the soda and then look at those collars you got the red from the grapes the red from the cranberries green it's perfect it's a perfect holiday salad so if you if this is something that's familiar to your holiday table go ahead and give this version a try I guarantee your family's not gonna even notice the difference and if you haven't tried it go ahead and try it out your family is going to be pleasantly surprised so that is basically it if anybody has any questions just go ahead and post them below the nutritional facts the pictures and the full recipe will be on my blog spot which I'll post the link to below until next time enjoy
