 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you my recipe for beef bourguignon or like a beef Burgundy stew now I'm not by any means saying this is the traditional like authentic version this is kind of my objective adaptation on it because I've never been to France so this is kind of my take on it the very first time I had this was in a amazing French bistro in San Francisco and it completely stayed with me for years since that and I started to kind of play around with things and make my own version of it and I think you'll really love this recipe it's easy to make it's got an incredible flavor and um it's just a crowd pleaser the ingredients are need for the base and there's additional ingredients which we'll go to in a little bit later I've got some Chuck that I've cut that I have cut into about large sized chunks I also have got some carrots and onions of the carrots I kind of kept it nice and big I also have some garlic that I've just peeled but I haven't chopped it I've got some thick sliced bacon that I've chopped you'll need some beef stock I've got my beef base back here first time you'll need some tomato paste some pepper touch of olive oil you need a little bit of cognac or brandy and you'll need some burgundy wine if you don't have Burgundy you can use Pinot Noir which is actually what I'm using today it's a bit more cost-effective I had on hand so I figured I would use that and I've used this before and it works really great Chianti really works great in this recipe as well and a quick tip if you don't want to dish up you know big bucks for a bottle of cognac or brandy get yourself on these little nips you know these are great at the liquor store you just buy what you need if you're anything like me I don't just typically drink cognac or brandy so buy little ones for cooking really helps I don't have any waste it's not sitting on my shelf for a long time when I only needed a little bit of it anyways I've got a big pot here preheating over about medium-high heat in there I'm gonna add in the bacon and I'm gonna let that render and get nice and crispy in the meantime while that's happening we move some stuff out of the way I'm going to take my beef to me I have some all-purpose flour here I'm going to coat my beef in flour I'm going to season this with salt and pepper now the flour does two things it coats the beef so it gives it a really lovely crust when you sear it but it also helps thicken the sauce as well so you know to brick one stone that kind of thing I'm just going to take a big spoon and toss this together to make sure all my beef is coated in the flour and the salt and pepper great let me just fish that out with like a slotted spoon or something because you want to keep that they can step back and fat back there so just take that out try your hardest not to eat all of it before you need to put it back in the pot because raise your hand if you're guilty of it I'm so notorious for doing that it's terrible now at this point if your bacon didn't give out a lot of fat like mine did mine's got a few tablespoons of fat in there then you would go ahead add a bit of a bit of olive oil but mine gave out quite a bit about a fat so I'm just going to do this with my hands I'm gonna put my beef in there that's been coated with my flour salt and pepper so good I'm telling you your house it's just gonna be filled with the most incredible aroma ever I'm gonna do this a matches because I don't want to overcrowd the pan let them cook for a few minutes and it's all over the place so that nice and golden brown and then we'll move on to the next step all right got all my meat color beautiful color let me just kind of drizzle a bit more olive oil now all those brown bits in there that's called mega flavor so don't you dare clean that pot I'm gonna add my veggies and my onion carrot and whole cloves of garlic season them with some salt and pepper and the moisture from the veggies is a help to kind of release those brown bits stuck at the bottom of the pan and they're also me add the liquid it will help as well gonna give this a good sir and let the veggies cook for about five or six minutes or until they develop some color and start to cook down a bit they look good I'm going to add in my cognac you'll need a quarter cup or so I would say a whole little nip this is 50 mils and just you can see as soon as you add the liquid look what happens and you scrape the bottom of the pan all those juices just release now I'm going to make something and talk about this because I know I'll get a lot of questions whether or not you can leave out the wine and the cognac just go ahead and make a different recipe because this recipe is you know the cognac or the brandy and the wine just add the sweetness that this recipe needs so if you are not an alcohol drinker then just make my pot roast or something else that's a braised beef because you know this dish is as delicious as it is because of them because of the wine so I just added some tomato paste I'm just stirring that in for about a minute now I'm going to add in a couple of cups of wine now traditionally you use an entire bottle of wine I'm using only a couple of cups and I'm going to do a couple cups to stop because now this dish is traditionally a very sweet kind of stew and I find that if you add all wine it's too sweet so I want to balance that by adding half wine half big stock and the end result is incredible it's the right balance when I had this for the first time it blew me away I heard about it a lot on TV people cooking it but I never kind of a I've never had it from a really good French bistro before so when I went to San Francisco a few years ago and I had it I mean it blew me away and I just been hooked ever since the only thing I did different is that I cut what I cut the wine in half so that it's not so so sweet because it is it is pretty on the sweet side then I'm going to add my stock but you guys know I just add my faith base oh let me grab a small spoon how dare be prepared but you know sometimes that happens what can I say and this Meister that in we're also going to add some time now traditionally this is cooked in the oven I'm just going to cook it on my stovetop with a lid on for a few hours or until the beef is nice and tender sliding the beef and my bacon right back in I'm going to bring this to a boil lower it down to medium-low cover to let it simmer for a couple of hours or until the beef is tender be warned that the spell in your home will be unbelievable trust me it's something really out of this world it smells incredible already wait till this gets going this has been cooking for about two and hours about two hours and 15 minutes and you can see I mean it is gorgeous it's thick the meat is really nice and tender look I can pretty much break it apart you can see with a wooden spoon now we are going to add our sauteed mushrooms and all their mushroom e-juices now make sure to taste this for seasoning I have tasted this for seasoning and I can tell you it is perfect for me because of that salty bacon we salted the meat we salted the veggies so there's salt on every layer so I'm gonna leave it as is and my onions my parsley I've got some parsley chopped up here about a quarter cup I really want that freshness Oh gorgeous I added my pearl onions they were thawed this just need to cook together for just a few minutes just to kind of warm up those pearl onions I mean look how gorgeously thick that is and that really does help it really does come from coating the beef in flour now I'm just going to clean up really quickly I've got some egg noodles that I'm boiling back there I'm going to toss them a little bit of butter you can serve this over anything whether it's mashed potatoes egg noodles with a potato gratin on the side anything you want just to make my life a little bit easier today I'm going with egg noodles or just a staple and it's really really easy to whip together in no time and it's just a perfect bed for those juices and that lovely meat my mouth is salivating I'm going to clean up get the egg noodles and put this together that is just incredible I've got my egg noodles here that I have buttered just got a little bit fer my husband and I for dinner show you what this looks like I mean look at this look at how thick and gorgeous that is I mean can we just take a minute to admire ah you can smell the smokiness from the bacon like immediately it's just amazing you also smell the cognac as well let me just go for the piece of beef right here you don't even have a Judas and so it falls apart it's got lovely smoky flavor you can taste the wine it's not overly sweet it's got a great balance I hope that you check out this recipe I hope that you make it and enjoy it as much as we do I hope you've enjoyed spending time with me the recipe will be Omar and Nick calm and always
