 hi this is penny and welcome back to the penny logic kitchen today I'll show you how to make a wonderful food shower crap it's a probiotic dish that when you eat it actually improves your gut flora which actually makes your body health you're in general on top of that if you have a hard time digesting cabbage when you eat the sour crap it's much more digestible and doesn't usually give stomach issues and this out has shipping than the stuff that I saw on the store because the stuff is on the store is pasteurized and therefore doesn't have the beneficial probiotics in it but when you eat this homemade sauerkraut it is very good and healthy for you it's really not a big deal to make it all and let me show you how all you need to make sauerkraut is these heads of cabbage if you notice these heads of cabbage are one of them is not whole and that really that's okay I actually have the cabbage sitting in my refrigerator for a little bit and I kind of forgot about them yeah um but I just cut off to that part you could still use the rest it's not very hard at all because the cabbage that comes in layers you just peel off the bad orange and you slip inside you cut the cabbage and along the slave leaving out the core it doesn't really matter how small you cut it because it will break up even smaller when you get it ready so I'm just cutting wide strips like that and then once I finish doing this for both heads of cabbage then we'll move on to the next part okay so I finished cutting up the cabbage I put it in large cast iron pot I have it doesn't have to be cast iron I just prefer to do it in cast iron because what's going to be next is going to lots of physical work and if you use just a regular plastic container it can start flying so I prefer something heavier but if you don't have a cast iron pot any big container will work I'm you see this course over here that's what I have left don't throw those it out put them in soup make a broth out of them you could even eat now what you need next is just some salt and a big wooden spoon like this this is what they call the crab pounder because what you have to do next is you actually have to bake at though after being the cabbage I don't use the crap rounder I just use a what and then it works just as well now this part is pretty messy I just have to go game the crap fish oh I sorry it makes a lot of noise too and you're going to put in some salt I'm not measuring exactly how much because I'll fix this amount of salt later right now just putting a little bit of course shell and then start pounding once you've pounded the crap a lot of the way then you start using your hands it's really a little hard work but it's also worth it because it lets that some energy and you know we have so much extra energy we have to burn some house so why not do it this way you know cuz you weren't tired enough from everything else you have to do but why not it's them the point of what we're doing now is they actually want to release the juices in the cabbage so you can either punch it like you know think of someone you're mad at and start punching the cabbage or just start squeezing it you know what think of something you really want to squeeze just I'm just joking ah but either way you want to get as much juice out of there as possible because if you want your sauerkraut to be good you want the cabbage juice to be the M the most of the liquid of the sauerkraut and not water um I've actually made sauerkraut both without housing it and with handing it and when you pound it it actually explodes less quickly whereas when you don't pound it it gets on those spoil faster see I finished pounding it and squeezing it and see how much liquid is here at the bottom that's a liquid that you want to have and at this point you actually want to be tasting it well none is more salt the way you know how if it needs more salt or not if you want it to be salty but not too salty that it makes you gross that because do you want to have salt in it to stop the bad bacteria from growing but if you have too much salt in it and the good bacteria can't grow either so you want to add enough salt so it tastes kind of like pickles but not way too salty that it's unpalatable so on there's exact measurements for how much salt you could add but I usually just do this to take now then I finished adding the salt and I tasted it to make sure it's the right saltiness you could add other spices if you want the traditional European ways to add caraway seeds and mustard or some people add Bailey's if you want to make it more asian-inspired you could add some ginger and garlic and scallions and hot peppers but I'm just choosing to leave this plane for next now we have to pack everything into a container I use a mason jar I'm aware that there's some controversy in the real food world about using mason jars for ferments but I don't really care um they say that using mason jars is not really good because it can let oxygen into the ferment and therefore you get in aerobic fermentation except instead of an anaerobic fermentation and all sorts of things like that but you know what people have been using sauerkraut for so many thousands of years then they never use a special pickle jar that prevent that check out all the oxygen so I'll just keep on doing the way people always did it and just pack it in my jar and no mine has not developed any mold and I'm not worried about that so just pack it into the jar yes it makes a mess to do that if you have a big funnel that'll help also clean up afterwards no point doing it now because it'll just make a bigger mess pack it in push it down if you hit a little sour cap those two heads of cabbage made and now once you finish packing up the cabbage you pour in the liquid see how much look what this is just from just in the cabbage there's no added liquid here now the bride is covering the cabbage up and now if your until you could add a little bit extra salt on the top to dissipate any bacteria from growing there and then you leave it on the shelf no not in the frigerator you leave it on the shelf in a somewhat warm place for about oh no a few days to a few some month even um leave it there to ferment and you'll notice it in a few days they'll start getting washed our and I want to write sourness you could either eat it or you can let it ferment a little longer if you don't eat it right then but you want to leave it that much for men to just put it in the refrigerator once it's in the refrigerator it'll last a good long well and now time to wash my hands
