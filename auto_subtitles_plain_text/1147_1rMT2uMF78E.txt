 hello and welcome back to another recipe video on the menu today our Singapore noodles I have no idea why this noodle dish is named after Singapore as our Singaporean friends have told us that it is nothing to do with Singapore but what I do know is that it tastes good and it's very easy to make we have only used shrimp but often people will add chicken or pork you could also experiment with other vegetables and the mouth curry powder if you don't want the dish to be too hot on-screen now the ingredients for full details check out our blog post I'll link to that in the description box just below this video ok so let's get started first place 150 grams of rice vermicelli noodles into a bowl of cool water and leave them to soak for about 15 minutes whilst the noodles are soaking beat one egg and then heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in a wok on a high heat and once the wok is hot add half a chopped onion and a quarter sliced red bell pepper to the wok and stir-fry them for about 90 seconds and then just set them aside now heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in the wok on a high heat and when the wok is hot just fry 125 grams of shrimp for a couple of minutes until the shrimp are pink and cooked and then set them aside with the onions and peppers that we fried earlier next heat one-and-a-half tablespoons of cooking oil in a wok this time on a medium heat and ensure that the old closed watt completely once the wok is hot pour in the egg that we beat earlier and to swirl it around the wok in a circular motion so that the egg covers the wok and then just cook the omelet until its light brown on both sides and then thinly slice it as shown here and set aside finally pour the remainder of the cooking oil into the wok heat on a high heat and then add two teaspoons of hot curry powder briefly stir fried the curry powder in the cooking oil then drained the 150 grams of rice vermicelli noodles that we were soaking and add them to the wok mix the noodles in with the curry powder and then add all of the other ingredients that we prepared earlier along with one and a half tablespoons of soy sauce half a tablespoon of sesame oil and one cup of bean sprouts mix everything together thoroughly whilst cooking for a final 1 to 2 minutes garnish with coriander then serve and enjoy so we hope you enjoyed our take on Singapore noodles if you give it a try do let us know in the comments what you think and if you're interested in seeing more Thai and Asian inspired recipes to subscribe to our Channel we're releasing new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday and we have lots of recipes still to come so thanks again for watching and hopefully we'll see you again on the next video
