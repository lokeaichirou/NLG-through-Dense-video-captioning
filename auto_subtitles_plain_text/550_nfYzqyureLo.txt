 muscles are usually something you associate with French or Belgian cuisine today Ben's gonna show us a great recipe with a Thai twist as with a classic Malmo neo we need a broth to cook our mussels in and this time it's gonna be tight style so we've got all these fantastic ingredients that class can use with Thai then we make it Spock with our coconut milk and then we'll steam all with mussels in there as well so we'll start with our ginger lemongrass and garlic now if you can just pee and roughly chop bat and same with the garlic and with the lemongrass or just took that outer husk off then what's left it she just chopped up nice and small cool down there like so meanwhile on this side I'm going to do the onion and chilli you can of course but all these ingredients into a blender and actually make a paste or in fact use its my place you can buy it for the supermarket for just a splash of oil in there to start out frying off I'm gonna get our onions in to start with the chili I quite like this dish with a bit heat so I'm gonna keep the seeds in as well it's higher your choice let me give you a little hand with those lemon guys like they'd be too much then thank you so our lemongrass nicely finely chopped nasty on that I love this better limbo so they can go into there with all of our ginger and garlic and we'll just keep it all moving and while we put the lid on there to help its steel concentrate on our muscles now these are not those ones Chapa SHhhh so some people get a bit concerned by which ones they can and can't eat unless it's very very simple if there are any that are broken it's not worth him he's probably alive but for the sake of a broken bit which might get shot of shell in there just get rid of it they're really cheap that's what we do so if you can just pick through those some for instance this one's really close satisfying the chance that's alive it's just shut up okay inflator on when we've cooked it it's still closed then we won't try and force it open depending on what time of year you get your muscles they will have lots of beard or less so it tends to be a factor of the seasons and just get stuck in there I'll let the Mojo not quite your beard so if you could just finish up 62 those because the rest of my pan is nearly ready ok we've fried those off at which point we can add in our coconut milk so holding the coconut milk and that's just going to bubble away in there and that's essentially what's going to cook and steam all of our muscles and becomes a great sauce to kind of dip them in at the end a little splash of fish sauce goes in there about a tablespoon and a splash of soy sauce and as you cook these all the juices from the mussels leap into that sauce you get a really kind of fishy Thai flavor excellent this comes from the shellfish so while we let that come up to boil then we can just prep some of our ingredients for later that's a little bit of fresh coriander and aline make everybody fishy bits yep but if you can just slice that in half squeeze it later on so now you can see all of that bubbling up there plenty of steam and which point all our muscles nice and clean can go into our pan right so give it one stir just to coat all those in flavors put the lid back on and allow it to cook and Steve about three to four minutes that's all the mussels need to open up and then we can serve so there we go that's all it takes a couple of minutes open up those muscles you can see how quickly they open up there's two portions in here looks like an awful lot but obviously you're losing the meat you're not eating the shell don't wear that too much the sauce at the moment important is getting all those muscles and then what's left in a pan if you can squeeze our lime in - yeah and our fresh coriander the uniform give it a good stir and that's essentially this final sort of bit of fresh seasoning and then we can put some of that ladle to stock which got all that beautiful musk fishy juice now over the top as well so there's plenty to dunk in - it smells ridiculously amazing ridiculously amazing that's what we like that's what we're aiming for and finish it with our final bit of lemongrass so there we go an awesome bowl full of mussels with an inspired Thai flavor sorted its kind of messy food but you just got to get stuff here those are incredible it's the balance of all the time favorite yeah it's got the lime juice so it stores the chili the lemongrass is fragrant it's salty it's sweet it's spicy everything
