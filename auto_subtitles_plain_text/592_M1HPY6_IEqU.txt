 hey everybody welcome to the Wolfe pit today we're going to make a quick and simple moist and delicious meatloaf so let's get started I'm going to start by making our filler for our meatloaf and a large mixing bowl I'm going to combine an egg l√∫cia Shire sauce cheap yellow mustard if you're feeling mr. and mrs. fancy-pants use Dijon mustard ketchup black pepper onions bell pepper and garlic and there'll be a link at the end of the video for the recipe and the amounts breadcrumbs then give this a good mix until everything is well combined and if you forgot to add salt now's the time to add it add two pounds of 80/20 ground beef and get everything well incorporated just do not overwork your meat otherwise you're going to have a very dense and sponge-like meatloaf just like your mother-in-laws once everything is well but loosely combined we're going to form this into a loaf now our meatloaf goes into a 325 degree oven for about an hour or until it reaches 160 degrees and now very simple glaze for a very simple meatloaf ketchup honey and whoosh ishara sauce give it a quick mix that's all there is to it put this on top of your meatloaf during the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking once your meatloaf is done let it rest on the counter ten to 15 minutes before slicing otherwise you're going to have dry and crumbly meatloaf and have to drown it and gravy and that's it that's all there is to it to make a very simple and delicious meatloaf thank you guys very much for watching I hope you give this a try and we'll see you next time you
