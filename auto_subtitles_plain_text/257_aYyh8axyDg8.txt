 I'm in my kitchen with some baby bok choy some food on noodle pasta some coconut aminos which is like a soy sauce substitute some soy sauce unpasteurized organic soil and some fish sauce I'm going to make some udon noodle soup okay so I have my stock pot here and what I'm going to do is pour this entire bottle of coconut amino acid which is like if you don't have soy sauce I'd like to use this or you can use this soy sauce it's a lot better a type of soy sauce so I'm going to make my stock and pour this in the pot you can add like a little bit of vegetable broth if you want and I'm going to fill it up with water as well so I'm I poured the amino acid coconut soy sauce in there and i kind of have the heat up on medium high and I'm going to pour so it was like a bottle and a half of the coconut amino acid so this by does 16 ounces so I'm going to fill this up with water and add water to this as well so I just feel this bottle up with water and I'm going to put like me a couple of tablespoons of fish sauce and the mix not too much and I'm going to let this I'm going to bring this to a boil maybe I probably add about maybe a couple of cups in the water so I'm going to bring this to a boil and then I'm going to reduce the heat okay so I pretty much feel the potable water I have the heat on medium high I'm gonna put a lid on it so I'm going to let this boil for about you know until it comes to a full boil so that should take about maybe 10 minutes or so and then I'm going to reduce the heat okay it is come to a full boil so I'm going to turn this down really low and i'm going to let this sauce simmer oh my goodness for about 30 minutes and then I'm going to add my noodles and my bok choy ok so my sauce has been boiling for about or simmering for about an hour so here are my noodles and we're changing camera hands here so I'm going to just dump these in here there's quite a few of us so I'm going to get to kind of just some fish goes in here and the family loves the udon noodles so i use i'm using two 8-ounce package and I'm not sure I think this might be like a 5 quart stock pot so I mean of course you don't have to put as much as I'm doing so the noodles need to cook for about 8 to 10 minutes so what I'm going to do is turn the heat back up to like about medium-high so that I can get another boil point and I'm going to cover this and then I'm going to add my bok choy writing for ready right before I serve it ok so my noodles are done you don't you know you're not trying to like cook them cook them so here's my bok choy then I'm is nothing special dumping it all in there some baby bok choy way so you don't have to like cook the bok choy just kind of letting the seasoning of the the broth get in there and sprinkle a little bit of some real salt over the top pink salt which is great all your salt should have color in it so smells great quick and easy meal and I'll let this simmer for about five minutes and it will be ready to serve
