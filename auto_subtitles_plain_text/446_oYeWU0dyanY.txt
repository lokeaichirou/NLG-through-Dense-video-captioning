 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make spaghetti alla Carbonara a lot of you have been asking for this recipe and it's super super simple it basically uses a few ingredients which you probably already have in your fridge so I'm really excited to show it to you let's go over the ingredients so we can get started you give me 1 small chopped onion about 4 to 5 slices of bacon chopped 2 eggs about 2 tablespoons of heavy cream some fresh Parmesan Reggiano and you're gonna need some spaghetti it's very very simple y'all certainly just a touch of olive oil and salt and pepper now you know you probably already have these ingredients in your fridge so why not make this dish tonight so good takes very little time to make about 15 minutes from start to finish and the easiest most delicious buy get there--like carbonara you'll find it right here the first thing I do is take a large pot fill it with water give it a nice generous sprinkling of salt and bring that up to a boil so you can have ready by the time you put in your spaghetti in so second thing you want to do is take an a not a nice skillet with high sides put about a teaspoon of olive oil in there a teaspoon not tablespoon you want to preheat it over medium heat so we can now go over there and so Terry our bacon first thing we do is put your spaghetti into your boiling water I'm just going to take my tongs and shoe this up and make sure that there are submerged in water give this a nice little toss now just going to add our bacon to our preheating olive oil and our nonstick skillet now traditionally you're supposed to use front check stuff pancetta is really very similar to bake and the only difference is it's not smoked but the reason why I use bacon because it's number one where I had in the fridge number two is just as delicious and number three everybody can find bacon it can be a little bit difficult to find pancetta so it's really no difference to it I'd like to use this nice lean center cut bacon that's my process but any bacon you're never man's will do so just cook this over medium I mean until it's nine what nice and crisp but not shoe to Chris because we're going to continue to cook it without onions our bacon is cooking up really nicely starting to get nice and crisp at this point you want to add in your finely chopped onions is one small onion and the reason why I'm not adding any salt is because the bacon is very salty and I don't want to overdo it but I do want to add a good amount of black pepper because cracked black pepper which I'm going to put here and and a little salt are going to make is a huge huge part important part of a really good traditional carbonara carbonara is very easy it's just bacon and eggs or pancetta and eggs really and everywhere you're going it only has your own way of making it I'm from southern Italy and from Naples this is the way we make it and we are proud of it so let's just just go together for a few minutes until the onions start to cook down and while that happens I am going to go back to the counter and show you how to make a sauce to go with it now in a small bowl we're going to put in two eggs two cracked eggs 2 tablespoons of heavy cream a ton of fresh 2 ground black pepper or as much as you like I should say remember it's very important into a traditional carb or not a recipe and a really generous amount of fun me John McDonald and this is it this is the sauce we're going to just put a tiny bit of salt in there not too much because remember our pasta water is well-seasoned our bacon is very salty our cheese is very salty so we don't want to overdo it that's a pretty good amount I just say perfect now we're not really going to cook this and you'll see you'll see how this comes together a pinch of salt and I'm just going to use my little whiz here and just mix this together now we have our sauce together I'm going to set this aside now all I did here was take my bacon and onions off the stove and this is important that you do this off the burner because you don't want to scramble the eggs I drain my pasta just going to add it to bacon and onions just like so now very quickly you're going to add in your egg and cream and finally john Reggiano sauce and just you're gonna have to work this really fast that's perfect because you really might want to scramble the eggs but you see how they're starting to cook that's exactly what you want I can't even describe how perfect this is every single time as long as you take the pan off the burner you'll have a perfect carbonara every single time just stir this together to mix smells like heaven in here it's amazing let me just plate this up oh boy that's perfection in my book right there that's the way a caponata should be it should not be drenched in sauce it should not be curdled and ugly and scrambled it should be silky smooth every strand of spaghetti should be coated in that sauce and I can't tell you how good the smells I mean you really should be here for this I'm just going to take this a bite of this I'm gonna embarrass myself I know it on the money that is so amazing now you know you have all these ingredients in your fridge so you know you need to get in your kitchen and make this recipe and if you want to get all these measurements and ingredients for
