 I'm going to make some pasta today sounds good to me I'm going to use some detail eating pasta and we're going to use quite a bit of olive oil and some tomatoes and some cannellini beans and some white pepper and garlic and I have pecorino romano here and a bay leaf and I have like two kinds of parsley just a little bit and a little bit of basil out this is all out of my garden I'll call it I don't have a lot let's get started I'm going to take them put some olive oil in my pan here maybe a little more but decent amount I'm going to add my garlic this is five cloves of garlic now I'm going to turn the heat on I'll turn it on about medium maybe a little below medium I'm gonna gently cook this garlic and in the meantime I want to take my two cans of white beans I'll put them in my strainer and rinse them as well the garlic is starting to turn brown and we really don't want it to go any further than that just Brown lightly I'm gonna add the can of tomatoes add a bay leaf and some salt about 1/2 a teaspoon of coarse salt and turn the heat up a little bit and get this going to come up to a bubble I'm going to cut up some of the tomatoes and I had a about 1/2 TSP of salt that you saw me do because these tomatoes really don't have any salt they actually have a little bit but it's says on the ax can 15 milligrams per serving we're American Tomatoes usually have 500 milligrams or more so they're virtually unsalted and I'm just gonna let this gently simmer for about 20 minutes it's been going for 20 minutes and I took some of the oil and skim some of the oil off the top and put it in here because I thought I put just a tad bit too much now I'm going to add the beans and stir those in and once it comes back up to a bubble well let it bubble for another 15 minutes just so everything can kind of combine and marry flavor I have my pot of water here to boil the pasta in and we'll start it well this gets going next you take your pasta that you cooked put it in there and your spices noting your spices your herbs which basil is best but I didn't have much so I put in some parsley as well and let's stir this up and turn your heat off and we're ready to plate and I also put the plate in here I also put about 1/4 of teaspoon of white pepper in this at the last moment I forgot to show it to you added the pepper whenever I added the herbs and if you like and then just a little bit of your extra special olive oil on top that's optional and of course your I'm using Romano you can use Parmesan give it a try I'm so hungry very nice pasta with beans something economical and delicious thanks so much for watching
