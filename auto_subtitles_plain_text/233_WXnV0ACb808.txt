 hey everyone in this video I'll be showing you how to make falafels this is a really wet vegetarian dish that chooses simple and pretty inexpensive ingredients so if you want to know how to make these keep watching in your food processor add the chickpeas these are dry chickpeas soaked overnight in water also add the fresh parsley fresh coriander leaves salt baking soda and black pepper also add the garlic onion and ground cumin blend everything together if necessary stock the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even blending this is your final consistency it should have has a grainy texture lightly all your hands and make little balls with the dough you can make these whatever size you want but just try to make them as even as possible so that they can cook evenly it's now time to deep-fry I'm using a toothpick to check the oil temperature you can see that there is a steady bubbling going on that means the oil is ready put a few falafels in the oil don't put too many because that will bring the oil temperature down let them cook for a few minutes until they get a deep brown color then remove them from the oil and drain them on paper towel here is a close-up of the outside crust and the inside I am quickly showing you how to make the tahini sauce to go with the falafel just make the tahini which is sesame seeds paste with lemon juice salt and water and that's it super easy and you can adjust the thickness of the sauce by adding more or less water thank you for watching guys if you like this video please give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already and I'll talk to you next week bye bye
