 we're getting some canola oil heat up the oil I'm putting about since we're making three cans of chickpeas I'm gonna put about three tablespoons maybe slightly more than three tablespoons of oil how much heat the Heat's on medium to high right now pans already kind of hot so we're gonna go with that giant onion one thing I remember reading once was about how different cultures cook garlic differently and so in Italy they like to make sure that the garlic is just touched by the heat they don't like to burn it whereas an Indian cooking a lot you'll see browned garlic maybe put the ginger and the green chili right so why don't we do that there's a nice deal by the way what is this that is full of the Amanda you sound like you're doing a little spark for them this is nice this is nice beer damn it yeah that's how they do it every step a point like can I not say this is my sphere without suddenly being seen as a commercial show so we've got so far the onion the chilies the ginger we're going to put in there two giant cloves of garlic that we chopped and could even put more depending on you know how much you love garlic I actually love garlic but I'm not gonna make this too crazy I think at this point we're basically ready for the spices you can take a quick look at the onion and you know you'll see that it is getting pinkish pinkish light like relish and I might say I would venture to say maybe so pull this money one could be so bold as to say that this is light brown so now we're ready for the master spice chana masala this is key and of course the way I'm gonna do it the way I'm gonna do it is I'm going to not measure anything but I recommend you don't do this at home the right way to do this really is you measure and I would say a tablespoon of this powder for each can of chickpeas it's probably good so that was one tablespoon I'm gonna go sprinkle another tablespoon right there oh and I'd say three tablespoons and I'm gonna put one more for good luck that's a bit I know I know it seems like a lot but there's a lot of chickpeas there's a lot of chickpeas that's me all right I think this is ready to go with tomatoes so at this point you can see this is all the brown spices sort of mixed in there the onions have reduced quite a bit and now we put in the tomatoes and honestly with tomatoes the more the better I really can't go wrong so quick recap onions you try to get them a little pink then you put in ginger and chili peppers then you put in a little bit of garlic and when everything is sort of getting pink you put it on the chana masala powder and when that's cooked a little bit you got to cook the masala a little bit of the spices and when that's done you put in the tomatoes and watch yourself basically you're essentially done at this point you're just gonna let the tomato and everything stew a little bit and at the end of that you're gonna put in the chickpeas and then you gonna just let it cook for as long as possible I think something I just want to mention here like this right here this is like the basis of a lot of Indian dishes if you want to use this as like a base you can make a lot of vegetables going forward from here that's right right all right so we got the first can of chickpeas in looking beautiful I'm really hungry yeah well the beauty is once you've added the beans it's gonna take very little so we're gonna put a little bit of water because it's a little it needs a little bit of water basically just by looking at it it looks a little mushy and it needs we need a little bit more watery gravy so putting about I would say half a cup right yeah salam√© and now the salt set up what are you talking about we don't do setups no that'll show it's just like natural by just looking how we normally are yeah yeah we talk constantly about what we're doing while they're cooking that's why I didn't I think part of the charm of what we're doing right here Pulis what seemed like you know sushi and Ishod are trying to make a cooking show yes I mean you gotta admit that's part of what's funny about this maybe that means that's what we should call it like something like sushi and they shot tried make a cooking show and he contributed to things to my life that I will never forget okay he was something do you kid yes the first thing was he would always say to be Frankie yes and then the other thing that he did was go playing cricket yeah and he gone out and then like in the next game I mean literally many games of cricket same evening yeah he came back and he caught on with his bat yeah I said I'm back with a vengeance I hope we got that one so just to prove that we're legit cooks all right we've got here all the way from India the champion of Indian cooking my mom who happens to be visiting me here in LA and so what better taster for the food than her so here she comes drum roll please go she's brought her own spoon and she's gonna sample and tell us if it's any good and I have more than two beers say to the camera please that was not convincing try it again take it again show some emotion so the chickpeas aren't actually saw some of them sometimes in some of these cans they end up being really hard and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a little bit of water okay just a little I would say like half a cup we're gonna mix it around I'm gonna mix it around like this and it'll cover it we're gonna cover it and turn it to somewhere between low and medium and leave it there for about I would say another 10 minutes we are going to garnish the chana masala for aesthetic purposes which consists of just picking up these chopped red onions do not explain some coriander we're gonna make this any worse than it is sprinkling it on top which really does look very nice I would say and I think we are all ready to eat 10 there you go beautiful perfection you can get good nan at Whole Foods and right now we've got some Trader Joe's naan which we're gonna pop into the oven it's the standard garlic naan it's not really naan per se but it works so we're toss it in there the ovens like 350 or whatever - dirty oven right now and just you know leave it in there for like I don't know 3 to 4 minutes check on it and then you'll be ready to go all right so here we go this is how you do it yes and so what you do is you just grab a bite you grab some chana masala and you stick it in your cake hole oh yeah how is that fantastic just probably shoot that again without using the word cake hole I think a coats great yeah yeah you can also do non ho
