 hi everyone I like California rolls because it's tasty and healthy every now and then I like to do DIY Kelly rolls because all I have to do is a little prep and everyone can assemble their own it's great for summer get together or whenever you feel lazy but one a light and healthy meal just be sure to serve it with hot rice and miso soup so let's get started start by dry roasting unseasoned nori sheets and a pan over medium-high heat it's toasted when it turns to either a light fluorescent green or reddish in color then cut into fours now prep the imitation crab line comes in long stays you can use the steaks passes but i like to flake it into strips because it gives a better mouth feel like biting into layers of a fossil then cut into the same length as the nori traditionally mayonnaise is mixed with the imitation crab to impart creaminess and to keep it together however I like mine plain but add a generous amount of avocado later instead now on to the vegetable I know it's common sense but be sure to wash them well prep the radish sprouts by cutting at the base of the stem then cut the cucumbers into long thin diagonals than Julian into sticks for the avocados it should be prepped minutes before serving to minimize oxidation as you see I like big slices of avocado on my rolls finally plate everything artfully cover with plastic wrap and keep it cold in a refrigerator until ready to be served at this time make sure to have soy sauce and wasabi dished out on the table soy sauce and wasabi is a must for California rolls to assemble add hot rice onto the nori at all the prepped ingredients and talk with Masako and spoon on some soy sauce and wasabi slurry thanks for watching happy day you
