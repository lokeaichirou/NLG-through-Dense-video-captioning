 hi welcome to show me the curry calm I'm hit oh I'm Volusia and today we're gonna be showing you how to make samosas I think it's a very very popular and very well-known appetizer and it's a very simple recipe but today we're going to be making for 2p to a bus so we're going to be making four samosas but the recipe that you see on our website and on the screen is meant for four people so approximately about 12 samosas so let's get started right so to start off with we're going to make the crust for the samosa and for that we're going to use one and a half cups of all-purpose flour or maida and to that we're going to add 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon of adjoint I'm going to mix this up and we're going to mix in two tablespoons of oil now this is a really important part when you're making samosa crust is that you have to make sure that the oil is completely incorporated into the flour and basically if you run it through your hands like this then you can feel the little lumps of oil you know make sure all the lumps are gone and then every bit of the flour has some portion of the oil in it and that gives you a nice pastry type crust so while Heather is doing that what we have done is just to give us a little head start we have soaked in one teaspoon of each of salt which is a delicious fennel seeds and one teaspoon of whole coriander seeds and over here we have one and a half pounds potatoes you boil them and peel them and we just kind of cube them so that's all prepped up and ready to go right and our flour is ready now it's completely coated with the oil and to this we're going to add in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and also quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons of water and we're going to need this into a nice soft dough and once that's needed we're going to just take a little bit of plastic wrap and just wrap it up in that so it doesn't dry up we're going to let our dough rest for about 20 minutes so why we have the dough resting you got this little time we're going to start on the mixture or the filling so we here like we mentioned we had already cut up the potatoes and cube them and what we're going to do is you're going to premix all the spices and everything to it and then cook it and over here we have a little pan and it's got 2 tablespoons of oil already heating in it so here's the we've drained out herbs the fennel seeds and the whole coriander seeds add it to this it smells so good and salt to taste 1/2 teaspoon of dry mango powder or unto 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala 1/2 teaspoon of sugar cilantro and it's about 10 strings 1 tablespoon of minced ginger and green chilli to taste and we're going to drizzle some lime juice to taste and we'll mix this up really well ok this is ready and you can actually taste it and make sure everything's ok good ok our 2 tablespoons of oil are hot you're going to add in half a teaspoon of cumin seeds allow them to sizzle looks good and 1/8 teaspoon of asafoetida so and 1/2 a cup of green peas your potatoes are already cooked so we're going to let the peas cook for about two minutes just to soften them up a little bit do we allowed them to cook for about a minute and look they look done you're going to add in the potato mixture now you know everything is cooked we're just going to cook it I'll keep it on the plane till everything is heated all the way through so it's been about 20 minutes and our dough has been resting all this time and are like we showed you the filling it's already done and we made sure it goes on to room temperature before you actually start putting it in right and we're going to need the still one more time just to even it out when you're making samosas or anything that you're going to fill it's always a good idea to divide out your filling - how many / you're making so one doesn't get more filling than the next and people aren't jealous all kinds of things like that so divide your dough out and - how many samosas you want to make one portion of course will make two samosas so divide that out divide your filling out and then you can proceed we also have already started heating up the oil and it's an medium heat and it's going to be needs to be very well heated all the way through before we add the simple cells into this oil so I put a little bit of oil on my rolling pin and just smooth it on there so it doesn't stick to our samosa dough and we're going to roll this out pretty thin because this is all-purpose flour and it tends to be a little more elastic than your normal wheat flour so the more you've stretch it out it kind of goes back into the shape so I make it very thin so once you have your dough rolled out into like an oval shape we're going to cut it down the center and we're going to take the side and we're going to take just a little bit of plain water and lightly brush the edge with this we're going to overlap the other edge on top and give it a good pinch seal it shut and once you do that you have a little cone that we can stuff in now and here we have divided the mixture as well the filling and we're going to put it in here like so and try not to over stuff because you want this part to actually seal we're going to take our water again a little bit of water and put it around our edges and then we're going to stretch this part and seal it and bend it here on the sides and you have your samosa ready to fry and while you're rolling the second one sometimes like I said the the meda or all-purpose flour is very elastic and the shape that you rolled out it reduces by quite a bit so you may have to roll it out again just a little bit so it's not so thick all right the oil looks hot and one little is carrying on I'm going to go ahead and fry beat careful put it in very gently do not splash it they look done we're going to pull them on to the side they got all the excess oil and we're gonna put it on a paper towel the samosas are done they look fantastic and of course the best way to have samosas is with chutneys do you have your diamond chutney and your mint chutney actually it with ketchup feels so good good so I didn't sell this absolutely I'm going to try this don't know about you but I'm ready for my small stuff all right mmm please excellent Oh delicious okay try it I gotta dig in better try it I'm gonna have mine with chutney so enjoy as Moses and join us again another sort of showing Akari calm my turn to get back to her adding a pinch of spice to your life you
