 hi foodtube carry on here I'm gonna show you my simple scrambled egg recipe so what we're going to do first which is most important is to put our frying pan on we're going to put our toast I'm using a griddle pan but just that's because I'm gonna be able to posh mode now I need six eggs in here I use happy eggs like happy chickens that's one two three four five six I've also got some evaporated milk I'm gonna use just a splash about 50 mils you don't have to use it you can use milk ordinary milk you can use cream you don't even have to put anything but if you don't like it now I'm gonna put a nice knob of butter into the frying pan to cook the eggs now to stop the butter from burning I'm also gonna put in a little tiny drop of olive oil as well in that goes this toast is ready so I'm just gonna crap that off and leave it there see that's the best thing about this recipe toast can wait the ex-con so we're gonna have a nice generous pinch of salt and again a generous pinch of pepper and then we're gonna beat them together simply with a fork this is such an easy recipe even the kids can do it I mean my children make scrambled eggs all the time nothing spectacular nothing fancy just beaten eggs and then we're gonna go straight in to the frying pan now as you'll see we want to use a wooden spoon as well because we don't want to scratch there the fine pan otherwise it won't be stiff nonstick anymore if you come in and have a look because we've preheated the pan the cooking process starts automatically straightaway so once you keep the eggs moving that's all you need to do is just keep them moving around the pan around and around don't leave it keep them moving because otherwise they'll just end up in a omelet and that's not what this recipes we don't want to cook them all the way because we're gonna leave them to rest so you'll see here that this looks quite running still but I'm gonna flatten it out over the pan and while I bottom my toast and then you'll see when we come back to there that will be perfectly cooked so just get some on the toast now I like butter as you can probably tell but if you don't you don't have to use it you can use a drizzle of olive oil or nothing but it's alright to splurge a little bit now let's go back to the eggs you can see now look the residual heat from that pan has put them completely so because they've set they're a bit lumpy so I'm just gonna chop them up a little bit and then this is for two people six six so we'll just take half I just put it on the plate like that and there you go my friends scrambled eggs the most simple yet effective recipe your lever maybe try it out let me know how you get on in the comments box below don't forget to subscribe but most importantly enjoy yourselves have you hook it
