 box-t first you want to pull your potatoes pinning three good-sized floury potatoes there and you want to have them you're going to cook half if you've not already got some leftover mashed potato and we're going to grate the ball your kettle it will come and crash bring them to the boil while they're cooking away great remaining half through potatoes give them a good rinse through remove any starch and they get a nice clean tea towel tip them out onto their fold the tea towel over and just get a little wiggle and a press just to dry them off just like that move any large bits as well measure out about a quarter of a pint of whole milk and then just put a little bit aside you're going to use that to mash your potatoes into the remainder you want to crack one free-range egg you know how I like the pepper straight in there good few twists and a little bit of salt it's good whisk around before and then to put that to one side a moment measure out about 50 grams of plain flour - or measuring the wafer to pout your grated potatoes into a bowl you want to add one good teaspoon of baking powder and then your flower quick Little Mix test your potatoes make sure they cooked put your bacon on to cook don't cook it fully but you have to allow for extra cooking time and then take it put it into the oven to keep it warm then measure the taytay's and add your cooked potatoes into your grated potatoes and flour it together with your milk and egg mixture this is good mix together to get it all mixed incorporated and the reason I put the bacon first is it sir it's always good to cook it in the pan that you've used to cook the bacon in so if there's a knob of butter into a frying pan and then when that comes to a soft bubble you want to put in your gallops of box.you mixture in there on a medium heat and cover and then when the top looks like it's starting to set that's when you can flip them over if you try before then you're likely to get quite a bit of a mess and I will break up on you they put them evenly on both sides I like mine quite well to set that down to preference and then start with some bacon and scrambled eggs usually have this on a Sunday morning the taste test very hot straight out of the pan but yes if you liked this video give it a thumbs up click on some other videos I've got a good scrambled egg recipe there nice Bailey's and chocolate cheesecake and a lovely leek and potato soup and if you've not subscribed already hit the subscribe button there and you'll see new videos as they come out thanks for watching bye bye
