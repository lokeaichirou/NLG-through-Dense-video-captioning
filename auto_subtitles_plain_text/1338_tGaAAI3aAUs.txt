 Hey Dude welcome to no recipe required I'm Dave and tonight I'm going to show you how to make a version of my mother's tacos I'll call them ground beef tacos now I'm making that like chick chicken tacos fish taco steak tacos all the time ground beef is not really something I go to all that much but I tell you when I do I absolutely love it brings me back to my childhood and it's a dish I absolutely love I think you will too okay we're gonna go ahead you don't have your vegetables chopped up this is a great time to do it you just want to move this around you know let it cook for two or three minutes then you know give it a good stir and make sure it's getting cooked all the way around okay so after my meat is browned off I like to remove it with a slotted spoon that's a an easy way there's a few different ways to take off the meat and separate it out from the fat and I don't need all that fat in in the taco meat so once I get this done I'm gonna drain off most of it then we're gonna come back and saw it start sauteing awesome guys I just drained off all my meat and most of the fact that was in the pan there I left a little bit because I need to saute mine that's the booths now I'm throwing in a full topped onion a pepper I have to be using a Paseo pepper which is not all that hot got a little bit of to it you can use whatever you want though how he knows our graves even red bell peppers green bell peppers are quite nice I'm just gonna let these cook down over like medium medium-high heat you want some salt and pepper and and go until the onions become translucent and nice and soft so once our pepper and onion is nicely cooked down like I said soft and translucent we're gonna add our spices now my kind of lead spice is cumin in this dish and I use a good amount remember we got all that ground beef to season and I think one of the keys here is to use the spices in the mostly dry pan here get them toast it a little bit which really helps bring out the flavor so there's a couple tablespoons of cumin couple maybe a tablespoon of chili powder half a tablespoon of oregano and just a few dashes because mine is really hot of cayenne pepper and I'm just gonna stir those in and let that let the a like I said the spices toast action I'm gonna add a little bit more maybe go 1/2 again more another half a tablespoon of kind of chili powder another 1/2 tablespoon of cumin let's add some salt again we gotta salt all that beef and some pepper and just let these go for about 5 minutes now less than 5 minutes three or four minutes okay so I just in I just gotta finish adding my tomato paste and as that's going in you just want to give it a quick stir and just like the spices I like to allow that tomato paste to cook down for three or four minutes over medium heat and that concentrates the flavor deepens and darkens the the flavors as well and it's gonna end up getting you a better result on the taco meat so I'll let that go stir every once a while make sure nothing's burning nothing sticking too badly and I will come back when it's time to add the beef back so after a few minutes I'm gonna turn my heat back up then I'm gonna add in that ground beef that we browned earlier and I'm just gonna mix and stir everything together and get it incorporated all right last couple ingredients secret weapon mom secret weapon a little bit of ketchup probably not the most traditional but adds a little bit of sweetness a little bit of vinegar and partners which is actually super nice and about a teaspoon a tablespoon of honey and I'm gonna add a couple nice heaping tablespoons of your favorite salsa we're gonna mix all this together and we're actually gonna add in about a cup maybe a cup and a half of water now most of that water is actually going to evaporate off as this cooks but I like to get it in there so that's kind of all the spices and everything we've got in there as a has a nice kind of fluid way to incorporate all the flavors that have been kind of brought together so far and once I get this fully mixed together I'm gonna turn the heat to low I'm gonna put the cover back on I'm just gonna let this kind of simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes so after 15 to 20 minutes you want to pull the lid off give it a quick stir you want to give it a quick taste for seasoning this one yeah I could use a little bit more salt use a little bit more pepper now you can um you can let it go as is or you can serve it as is it's totally totally good if you want a little drier just go ahead and cook it like another 10 minutes or so with the lid off and as you cook it more that water will evaporate I think this is just fine and dandy let's go ahead and serve it okay let's go ahead and plate our tacos ground beef this is uh basically just like my mom used to make probably like a lot of us used to have probably not super traditional but absolutely super delicious you know throw whatever toppings you want I like maybe a little sour cream on mine ears and then certainly a little cheese a little bit of lettuce and you are good to go I'll see you next time on no recipe required
