 hi guys st. Patrick's Day is fast approaching it's gonna be next week Tuesday but I wanted to put up this video well in advance because I want you guys to have time you will get the ingredients that you're going to need to make this fantastic dish we're making colcannon take a look at it isn't that gorgeous oh my goodness potatoes and cabbage and bacon where can you go wrong with this I promise you're gonna love it you're watching the bear pantry show because I'm only gonna feed about three or four people I only need four medium sized potatoes I've washed them and now it's just a matter of peeling them and then dicing them small because I want them to boil rather quickly so over to the stove I have a big pot of water and I just gotta throw my potatoes in and let them go and they're gonna cook till they're tender while those are cooking I'm just gonna add a few slices of bacon to this skillet and I'm only going to add about five or six pieces but you can add as many pieces as you need okay cut the fire on and then just a lot of bacon to cook now over to the counter again I'm moving rather quickly here cut a head of cabbage in half and then just go ahead and get the half chopped up no you want to chop them up kind of small but not too fine and I'm only going to use half a cabbage I'm running my knife through it to get all the big chunks and I've decided that it's too much because the head of cabbage was too big so I'm only going to use what's on the plate I've brought Joe in to help me with the bacon because it's moving too quickly now here comes the onions well 1 onion I'm gonna dice a path for this onion this is how I dice only guys you know I know it's not fancy but this is how I get it done and so Joe is cooking the bacon we don't want the bacon too crunchy but we don't want them underdone take them off and put them on a piece of paper like this and no we want the bacon grease because we're gonna dump the cabbage in the same bacon grease and it's not a whole lot of grease ok so don't panic put some onions in and just go ahead and let this saute for a little bit until they're slightly tender and then over to the cut the stove off and then pour it through a colander in the sink and now just kind of drain it off really really well we're gonna make mashed potatoes alright so they'll dump it back into the pot and then mash and I'm using my potato masher and you want to mash them according to what you like I kind of like my mashed potatoes kind of chunkier rather than smoother so I'm not gonna like overly mash these okay so I'm still going through it to get the bigger pieces and now I'm just gonna put some salt and some black pepper and if you want to put other spices to make it more you know vibrant for yourself just go ahead and do that about half a cup of milk I don't want this to get too soft and squishy okay so here we are we're kind of ready here now over to the counter oh let me taste first yeah it's nice so let me get my cabbage I'm just putting it in the colander to drain off some of the grease but it's not a whole lot of grease that's really left in it and now back over to the counter I'm just gonna tear apart the bacon and it they're gonna crunchy when I like it like that you know it's just depending on what how you like your bacon so here we are we're ready to make this medley first thing I'm gonna do is dump the bacon into the mashed potato dump the cabbage mixture in and then just use a wooden spoon to just kind of fold we don't want to stir we just want to fold and get everything all mixed in at this point you can add some melted butter but I don't want to do that yet I'm gonna do it after did you guys notice that I'm wearing my green for st. Patty's Day so dump everything into a big serving bowl and after it's all in here I'm gonna create somewhat of a crater in the middle to pour this wonderful beautiful butter now all I want to do is kind of fold the butter in so every part of this dish can get some of this beautiful butter okay so it's easy how simple is this this is gonna serve three to four people look at the bacon on top and voila just lovely so wasn't that fantastic now let me tell you guys enlist some help if you're trying to do everything at the same time okay because I was trying to cook the bacon and the potato and dice up the cabbage and the onions all at the same time and I had to holler for Joe to come help me with the bacon now you can do it by yourself if you just kind of cook the bacon separately first and set it aside and then you can pretty much handle everything else but if you're trying to do everything at once and list some help okay your family loves to come help in the kitchen they just don't like to clean up the mess I promise you this is so good I love this I made one time before and I absolutely adored it so I had to do it again so this is my little Irish meal from my kitchen to your kitchen you know my maiden name is McNab but it spell MC NAB and my grandfather was Scottish and so I always thought that was the correct spelling of the McNab until somebody told me that the Irish people spell McNab MC NAB and the skies spell that ma see if that's true let me know for my Irish viewers if that's true let me know but anyways I'm a McNab before I married Joe who is the Greenwich so if you guys like this video hit the thumbs up please share it with your friends and family for me and have a safe and happy st.
