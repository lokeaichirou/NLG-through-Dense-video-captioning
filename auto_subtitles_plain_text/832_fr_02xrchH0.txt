 hi I'm Carrie Zaretsky from French Revolution food calm and I'm going to show you how to make the perfect parisian croque monsieur so here's what you'll need to make for giant cook Monsieur four slices from one loaf of white sandwich bread that has been cut the wrong way so the long way one tablespoon of unsalted butter 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour 1 cup of whole milk one-and-a-half tablespoons of Dijon mustard 5 ounces of grated Gruyere cheese a pinch of ground nutmeg some salt and pepper to taste eight slices of black forest ham and as many corner shelves as you want so we're going to start on our giant hook miss Tia and coke Mesilla is just a fancy way of saying the best ham and cheese sandwich ever so we're going to start off with our bread I've just toasted it under the broiler one minute on each side so we leave this aside for a minute and turn our attention to the morn a soft I put the pot on medium low heat I'm added 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter now I'm going to whisk in 1 tablespoon of flour and this just thickens up the sauce we're going to cook it for about 30 to 60 seconds until it bubbles up and they just smell like baking cookies I'm just going to add 1 cup of milk no skim milk in this recipe leave this on medium heat step 3 to 5 minutes whisking every now and again until get my said bit you can tell it's thick enough because if I run my finger down the back of a spoon it stays separated add about a tablespoon and a half of Dijon mustard which goes so well with ham whisk it in then secret ingredient a pinch of ground nutmeg finally about one ounce of the Greer we're going to assemble our coke Mesilla got two slices per sandwich have our sauce we're just going to pour it all over the top of the sandwich sprinkle it with great agree air so we're going to run this under the broiler just for a few minutes until the cheese bubbles up beautiful she's hot welcome
