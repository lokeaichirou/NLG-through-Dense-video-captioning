like you can add a little bit of toasted sesame oil to the spinach as well as a pinch of salt mix well and set spinach to the side the next step is stir frying the vegetables in a walk poor about a tablespoon worth of cooking oil add a pinch of salt warm the eye to medium-high temperature once the walk has warmed you're going to individually cook each vegetable I'm going to start with the carrots cook vegetables on medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until Kendall's in the meantime coat a large pan finley with oil and set the hide to the lowest temperature next take your carrots after they've been stir fry for 2 minutes and place them in the pan that's staying warm on the back I cover the pan with a lid to keep the carrots warm next take a paper towel and clean out any extra carrots that were left behind and then you're going to start the process all over again cooking your next set of vegetables put a dash of salt and then separately place your next set of vegetables into the one oil you're going to repeat this process for the squash and the cabbage you can choose to cook the cabbage along with the onions after each of your vegetables has been sauteed and kept in their own individual pile continue to keep them warm on the back I next take a skillet and coat it with one to two tablespoons of oil make sure the bottom of the pan is evenly coated warm the pan up using medium heat once the pan is warm crack an egg into the skillet and fry an egg for every person that will be served at the smell each person gets one a after the eggs have been fried make an
