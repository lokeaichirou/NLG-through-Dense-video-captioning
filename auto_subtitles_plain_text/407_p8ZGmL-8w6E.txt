 [Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm gonna show you how make tabbouleh salad it is so delicious really refreshing really healthy perfect to just keep on hand for everyday lunches to just you know jazz up some boring old chicken it's really really really easy to make let me take your word ingredient so we can get started you're going to need some bulgur wheat water cherry tomatoes a lemon cucumber scallions fresh parsley a little bit of fresh mint salt pepper and extra virgin olive oil so let's just get right into the cooking because I'm really excited for this in this pan I'm going to put in my water now if you follow the instructions on how to make bulgur wheat on the package it tells you for every cup of bulgur wheat that you're cooking you should use double the amount of water which is two cups would be in this case because we're using one cup of bulgur wheat however I don't like to use two cups of water I use a cup and a half because two cups of water mix doesn't make it really fluffy and it gets too wet and muddy and doesn't really taste good and it doesn't have a good consistency so to 1 cup of bulgur wheat I'm using one and a half cups of water and all I'm going to do is wait for that to come up to a boil my water is up to a boil time to add in the bulgur wheat a good sprinkling of salt because you want to make sure that you're seasoning the bulgur wheat itself so give this a little stir turn this down to low put a lid on and let that simmer for about 15 minutes and in the meantime I'm going to get going to prepping the rest of my wall veggies the first thing I'm going to do is chop up the Rose not the rosemary the parsley and the mint now the first time I've had I had the salad was actually not too long ago it was about a month ago I was in California doing some work and they had lunch catered and one of the items was this tabbouleh salad which I had never had before as soon as I ate it I instantly became hooked on it it was so good and if you follow me on facebook what you definitely should by the way you'll know I have just been really obsessed with bulgur wheat lately and I have been making it constantly because I love it for lunch with like just like a can of tuna on top or even some good grilled chicken breast it's just so good and it's super super filling and I just really really enjoy it so what I'm going to do is just finely chop these fresh herbs and it's really critical that you use fresh herbs for this and I've never tried it with any other combinations besides the parsley and mint so I'm not sure how it would taste if you were to substitute any of the two now when I had this it did have a lot of mint in it which I thought was a little overpowering so I cut it down to only two tablespoons of mint and one large bunch of parsley so I'm just going to finish mincing this up that looks fantastic putting that right into my large bowl along with the cherry tomatoes that I have I don't like a lot of cherry tomatoes because I feel like they can become a little watery and I don't like that so I'm gonna take my scallions and just mince these or chop them just nice and small I want everything to be like little tiny pieces gallons go right in next is the cucumber none of these this cucumber that I'm using is called a seedless cucumber but as you can see there's seeds in there so I want to remove those because again they can make the salad really watery because they are full of water so get rid of the seeds I don't suggest doing it this way I suggest you take a spoon and just take them out this way much much safer sane and smells really good though they smell super super fresh rich so it's a good thing and then I'm just going to cut these into matchstick pieces like this like little sticks and then run my knife across them to make little pieces last piece now you know I normally have everything prepped and chopped and ready but I didn't want to do all of that today because otherwise you wouldn't really be able to hang out everything would be prepped and ready and I would just have to put everything into a bowl and that would be done what's the fun in that right stop in here I'm going to grate some lemon zest I'm going to have the I'm going to grade the entire zest of this lemon that's great and I'm going to also juice it cut in half I use a fork it really gets a lot of the juice out you wouldn't believe it look at that I've grabbed another half of a lemon whoops because you know me I just I can't get enough of lemon juice and orange juice and lemon zest and orange zest I just really really love citrus I got one and two seeds in there that I don't want here you go what hands we're going to give this a good drizzle of really good quality extra virgin olive oil I would say about two to three tablespoons salt and pepper the veggies and like I said I mean you know it's just my husband and I but I don't let it stop me from making a huge bowl of it because keep it in the fridge for a couple days and you've got a delicious lunch ready or a snack or you know along some grilled fish for dinner whatever you want toss all of this together and I'm just going to set this aside and wait until my bulgur wheat has cooked and then we are going to finish the entire thing up together my bulgur wheat cooked for about 15 minutes it's so delicious and perfectly cooked and not watery at all because we only used a cup and a half water rather than using the recommended two cups because it would make it really watery so you always want to use a fork to fluff it up just like you would with rice you just want to make sure you don't scratch your pan as you do this get it all out into your bowl and then using two forks I just mix all of this together and the hot bulgur wheat immediately wakes up the mint and parsley and the lemon it just smells fantastic give us a good good mix now looks great I'm going to just give this a taste now I'm going to be honest about something this is going to taste delicious however give it an hour in the fridge it's going to taste ten times better something happens where all those flavors kind of soak in to the bulgur and it just becomes something that it's like ten minutes just an hour in the freezer and in the freezer an hour in the fridge makes a huge difference it took what ten to fifteen minutes to put it together but it's fantastic oops that is outstanding it really really is the mint is just perfect not overpowering at all but really really delicious and I think it's a crucial ingredient when making the salad that's it but simple is quick it's easy it's healthy and you need to go to wwhen you calm to get the recipe make it for your family let become a lunch table in your house just look it has a lunch staple not stable in your house just like it's become in our house I hope you enjoy spending time with me and I'll see you next time bye-bye you
