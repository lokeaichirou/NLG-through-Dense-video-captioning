 alright youtubers today we're going to be making spicy tuna rolls you will need yuck annoy rolling seaweed some ketchup and mayo sushi rice hot chili sauce otherwise known as rooster sauce garlic powder some salt or if you can find the combination that's already mixed up that's great and sushi seasoning also known as sushi vinegar and shimmy grade tuna have some already made up so this is what you'll be shooting for as your finished product so let's show you how to get there this is I have one cup of sushi rice that have added my sushi seasoning to this is basically a sushi vinegar come this is this brand is made a little bit more for sushi because it has a little bit milder taste kind of a sweeter flavor to it not as strong and straight sushi vinegar just add it to taste onto your rice on this rice is cooled almost room temperature you don't want to make too hot rice he's hot rice in your sushi and some people use their fingers to put their rights on their rolling paper seaweed but I use the rice spoon it makes the nice even smooth bed for your tuna because you want some pretty sushi don't some lopsided sushi check it out all the way to the edge of the rolling sea weed like so and that's about I guess four inches or so I guess you can say such a mean greater tuna cut you a piece that's about half inch thick so take that piece and cut it in the middle so two pieces lay them on your rice so into end so there it goes over to the hitch this is your spicy tuna sauce it's just basically half mayo half catch up and then you add your spicy sriracha chili sauce in or people call it rooster soft spoken as a rooster all in front of it and get this about any store you can add your garlic powder and salt and just some black pepper this is actually garlic salt and mix already mixed up so you just add a few dashes in there and stir it up and chased it you know see how hot you want to make it just keep adding this hot sauce in to get as hot as you want and then you just basically put a little layer on your tuna kind of give it a little coating on all those sides like Sir if you want more you can add more or less so here's your sushi ready rolled take it and roll it over and you roll it up and you will need to have some water in a bowl twitch your fingers in just so you can add a little water to the edge you're throwing seaweed to make it stick it's just like an envelope once it gets way to get sticky and you just roll it right over there and that edge will stick itself down to the other side of the sushi roll and there it is okay and usually one role will make about eight pieces I don't cut my pieces really babe i can get ate out of one roll pretty easy you can see when you use the right spin you can get a nice even amount of rice onto your role and your tunes in the middle is it really nice and neat if you want to you can add a little bit more your spicy sauce on top to give it some color and make it just a little bit hotter they have a whole plate of spicy tuna rolls ready to go remember practice makes perfect if your sushi doesn't come out perfect the first time it's okay just keep practicing and you'll eventually get I no idea and good luck and happy sushi rolling
