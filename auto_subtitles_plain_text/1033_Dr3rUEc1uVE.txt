 I'm Katie ten I'm a food blogger a cookbook author and a working mom my cooking videos are all about fast fresh and fabulous Asian recipes that anyone can make it home hi I'm general Chen welcome to the sweet-and-sour chronicles today I am making General Tso's chicken legend has it this popular dish was named after the great statesman the Ching dynasty General Tom Thumb Hey sadly general Tsao is just a fairy tale but the reality is this delicious dish which is simple delicious tangy spicy a little bit sweet was invented in the 70s when Chinese chefs immigrated to the US it was first introduced in New York City's Chinatown I had this for the first time when my parents brought me to New York when I was 12 years old and we went to the legendary New York Chinatown I couldn't believe how many Chinese people were there it's I grew up in Minnesota where there are hardly any Asians at the time in fact we didn't have any clubs we belonged to the sense of Norway despite all of this I've learned how to make this dish and I'm going to share it with you today it's delicious it takes maybe a step or two more than a stir-fry but it's definitely worth it we're going to start with the sauce I'm just going to take some dark or black soy sauce dark soy sauce has actually been fermented with molasses making it richer and a bit sweeter if you can't find dark soy sauce regular soy sauce is fine a little bit of cornstarch a little bit of xiaochun wine if you don't have shaofeng why you can use dry sherry some rice vinegar a little bit of sugar for the sweetness some minced garlic a little bit of minced ginger and a bit of chicken broth so I'm just going to whisk this together and we'll set it aside for later now we're going to make the batter for the chicken this is a very light batter we're going to flash fry it in oil and then we're going to saute the chicken in the sauce so I'm just going to put some cornstarch in this bowl add a slightly beaten egg some white pepper some more shaofeng wine or dry sherry and now some regular soy sauce I'm just going to toss this to combine okay and now I'm going to add some chicken pieces we just diced up some chicken breast and a toss to coat it with our batter and this is a much lighter batter than some of the goofier batters you can find in Chinese takeout okay so we're just going to let this sit for a bit while we get our oil heated up now we're ready to deep fry our chicken pieces I have some corn oil here that I've heated up to about 350 degrees just going to deep-fry these so they get nice and crispy I'm just going to fry about ten pieces at a time because you don't want too many pieces of chicken in the pan or it'll reduce the temperature of the oil making it kind of soggy so I'm just going to go ahead and finish frying all these up now that our chicken pieces are flash-fried we're ready to stir-fry them in my stir fry pan with the amazing sauce I'm just going to turn on my pan add some canola oil I'm going to add some dried Chinese chilies which are sold in Asian markets if you can't find them you can also substitute with chile de arbol which you could find it a lot of grocery stores and let market and to this I'm going to add some chopped green scallions and we'll just saute this for about a minute mmm chilies and onions are so fragrant I just love it now we're going to add our fried reserved chicken pieces and we'll just stir fry this for about another minute now we're ready to add the stir-fry sauce YUM I can smell that sweet dark soy sauce the xiaochun wine yummy I'm just going to toss the coat luf oh the sauce just caramelizes wow that looks really good ooh sticky spicy sweet and tangy I'm getting ready to plate this up mmm boy does this smell good garnish with some more scallions and now I have to take a general sized bite mmm she'll go WOW after eating that I still definitely believe in fairy tales now for the full recipe go to my blog the sweet and sour chronicles com make sure to subscribe let me know what you think until then happy cooking please check out my latest cookbook everyday Thai cooking available on Amazon and fine booksellers everywhere
