 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen before the summer runs away from us I figured I have to share with you my recipe for my chicken kabobs I make these very often in the hot summer months and this is really the recipe that I get from my mother and it's very much identical to the way she makes it yeah except I've got one X additional ingredient not so I'll talk about in a minute you'll need some chicken breasts these are about 6 ounce chicken breasts that I've cut into about 2 inch pieces you want to make sure that they're all relatively the same size boneless and skinless I'm going to limit in an orange which is my addition and then I've got some rosemary some garlic salt pepper olive oil and just a teeny teeny teeny tiny bit of honey as I said banana I don't know who I'm gonna give me Hannah frog tiny bit of honey really couple teaspoons that's it but what the honey does is caramelize it's give almost like a sweet caramelize a Shinto the chicken and it balances this tart lemon with the the / sort of really really sharp garlic it's a you know marriage made in heaven I'd like to add a tiny bit of orange dis only because if I had a mayor lemon I wouldn't in fact if you're going to use on mayor lemon for this recipe don't use the orange but because I don't have a mayor lemon which is really a mixture between a tangerine and the lemon I'm gonna use a little bit of zest and a little bit of juice of the orange just to kind of make my own mixture I just feel like it so anyway let's get started we've got some garlic and I've got some rosemary I'm gonna first of all get rid of the skins and then I'm going to pile my rosemary leaf that rosemary is really strong so if you're not a fan I would say substitute something like a my parsley which is mild or you could use thyme which was really well with the lemon and garlic as well but rosemary garlic very traditional very Italian very what I'm used to so that's what I'm using I'm going to just take whoops so skin that's none come off there we go I'm going to take my resume you're just going to strip the leaves right off the stem I don't want the stem the stem is really tough however when I was a child and rosemary grows in Italy like you wouldn't believe like on side of road the rosemary stalks are super thick and they were super long that my grandma my and my mom when we would have them on hand they would use the stalk as the actual piece that you know as your actual skewer for your kabobs so that you've got that flavor as it's amazing unfortunately this little rinky dinky thing isn't gonna work for me but if you've got some really sort of sturdy and pieces of rosemary do that it's fantastic I'm gonna take these and I'm just going to give everything a really good chop all together that looks really really good I'm going to grill these indoor today well because it's not very good weather and therefore it would look really dark and cloudy if we were outside but if you are doing this outside it's fantastic now bring this closer to me a little bit of orange sex not a whole lot because remember we're trying to get a familiar taste from the mayor lemon so a little bit of orange a lot of lemon it really kind of you're making your own concoction the Italian mayor lemons are unbelievable and I just get so angry that my supermarket doesn't carry them I mean come on all right that's good enough and I want to put too much and then I'm just going to squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and orange juice probably half of an orange and half of a lemon that's good gonna get a little morphine all right let's salt and pepper this really well you like my know what I've done is I've taken my pepper mill grinder whatever it's called that I've just changed the setting so my black pepper a bit more coarse and I've been really digging it and then even though I could do that but apparently you learn something new every day just take a little bit of olive oil not too much just a couple tablespoons will do the trick for some reasons like coming out super slow and just a small amount of honey that is it what was that like a teaspoon and a half that will make a difference just trust me on this and then give everything a really good stir and then I'm going to cover this and pop it in the fridge for a half hour so maybe a little bit more and a honey also really helps thicken the juices like those the lemon juice and the orange juice and therefore really coats to chicken well which it's all the good thing stir it really well cover this with plastic wrap and in the fridge it goes and then it will be time to grow these up I check in with in the fridge for about 45 minutes you want to make sure you don't want to go too long otherwise the lemon juice is actually going to start cooking the chicken it'll break it down the acids gonna break it down you don't want that so 45 minutes it'll do the trick I took it out of the fridge about five minutes ago because I don't want to put something super you know super cold chicken on a hot grill pan it's gonna seize up and become really tough now what I have here is some red onion it's cut but same size as the chicken now red onion is something else my mother always always always has on her kebabs or kebabs or spiedini or brochettes however you call them she sometimes also like to add zucchini and peppers but since I'm making a roasted vegetable and spaghetti with dinner up to go along with this I'm not going to add them here but you can absolutely for my skewers I always like to use like the middle ones two reasons one I always have them on hand because I wash them from the back of my drawer too when you're cooking kebabs and you cook them on a metal skewer the heat is actually going to hit the metal and it's going to cook the chicken from the inside out so it's actually doing two things it's helping you coat the chicken faster and more evenly and it's also you know you clean it it's friendly it's good to go though there you go now you can do this in whatever particular where you want I always start with a couple pieces of onion and I'll go all the way I leave about two inches here then you take a couple pieces of chicken and as you can see they're all about the same size and depending on how many pieces of chicken you put on your skewer you're going to get more or less kebabs so for that and then some more onion and then just a couple more pieces of chicken and then finish it with finish it off with the onion that's how I do it anyway you have to do it that way but it's just what works really well for me and that's how I've always done it so if it ain't broke don't fix it I got all my chicken here skewered up I got about six out of my mixture which is about right usually get about six out of them if again if I was putting less chicken on you'd get probably eight then this is a skewer and then pack it as much of ticket on it anyways I've got my grill pan preheating I have it about medium heat I don't want to put it too high because it'll develop too much color before the chicken gets a chance to cook so meaning he usually works works perfect for me until just a little tiny bit of olive oil on it just so that nothing kind of sticks and develops color then I'm just going to take each one and get on there all right I'm going to let these cook for about two to three minutes on all four sizes I'm going to just turn them from each side and until they're all evenly colored and it's cooked all the way through I'll show you what they look like when they're done just make sure you keep an eye on the heat you want to be medium you don't want these to ha actually just turn mine down a little bit so it's in between medium and medium-low it's in under those colors but you just want to make sure that it all goes kept cooked really well so let's go and I'll show you what they look like when they're done my kabobs were on the grill for about three minutes on all four sides and so it's total will take about 12 minutes for the whole batch if you have to make sure you get your heat on the perfect setting mine is medium it's got gorgeous color did not burn mmm I'm trying that honey definitely does add a little something to the coating the lemon rosemary the garlic they're absolutely delicious make sure you let them cool a bit before you handle them because the metal skewers will be SuperDuper hot we're gonna do the same recipe we've seen pieces of pork using seafood obviously the time the cooking time will vary I have enjoyed spending time with guys head on over to our educational Commons at this recipe clam lamer works really well as well in this recipe I have enjoy spending time with me ask the next time bye bye
