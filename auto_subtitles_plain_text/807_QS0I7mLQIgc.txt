 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with tomato bisque that's right we're doing tomato soups richer and slightly more promiscuous cousin the tomato bisque and if you're worried you can't make this because you don't have access to fresh vine ripened tomatoes don't worry we're not going to use any that's right we're going to use canned tomatoes but don't worry all will be explained okay so the first step here is going to be fairly standard soup making procedure we're going to put our soup pot over medium heat with a little bit of olive oil in it and we're going to sweat some onions and celery and as usual we're going to add a big pinch of salt that's going to help bring out a little bit of that liquid so we're going to give that a stir and we're simply going to cook that for about I don't know six or seven minutes five or six minutes I never time it I just cook it over medium heat until the onions kind of soften and turn translucent and look something like that see and there's the magic of video that would take me like a paragraph to describe the look but we don't have to you can just look at and go ah that's what it means okay so at that point we're going to add our garlic and give that a stir and we're going to cook that for just like a minute the only real way to screw up this step would be to Brown the garlic which reminds me to tell you do not brown the garlic alright just saute it for like a minute and then we're going to introduce our liquid I'm going to use chicken broth that's my personal choice of course a vegetable stock will work beautifully here especially one made with mushrooms mushrooms and tomatoes always delicious and if times you're tough you could just use water that's fine well not really fine but it'll work so we're gonna pour that in we're going to give it a stir and then it's time for the star of the show the tomatoes and I'm going to use one large can of crushed san marzano tomatoes oh we've talked about those before and on the blog post I will explain in detail why I'm not using fresh tomatoes for this and spoiler alert it's the exact same reasons we usually don't use fresh tomatoes for tomato sauces and by the way if you can't find crush san marzano the can of whole san marzano will work you just got to crush them yourself and that would be fine because we're going to blend all this anyway so we're going to stir in our tomatoes we're going to raise the heat we want to bring this up to a simmer so I'm going to turn my flame up to high and while we're waiting for it to bubble let's go ahead and season this up a little bit I'm going to go with some freshly ground black pepper a little touch of cayenne and a little bit of paprika I'm using the plain but I have used the smoked paprika before in this and it is lovely at this I probably had a little more salt also but my chicken broth was perfectly seasoned so I'll taste and adjust for that later and besides the salt I'll warn you right now we're also going to add some sugar to this very critical ingredients but I'm going to wait on that too okay so all we're gonna do is simply wait for this to come up to a simmer at which point we're going to stir in the ingredient that really makes this a bisque and that would be the rice so we're gonna stir in about three tablespoons of regular white long grain rice actually used a variety of rice called jasmine but really anything will work and just like saying Jasmine jasmine its we're stirring the rice and that's what's going to thicken up this soup but it's going to be silky not starchy which is kind of funny because we're adding starch but it's not going to be that kind of starch and as you get if you add a whole bunch of flour based Roux or cornstarch and that's another thing I'll talk about more on the blog post and then the game plan here is I want you to adjust the heat down to low medium low which ever provides you with a nice steady simmer and while that's simmering if you want to skim any foam off or any of the fat that rises to the top feel free this is not my biscuits your bisque so I did do a little bit of recreational skimming and all we're going to do is let that simmer for about 35 to 45 minutes or until the rice and vegetables are absolutely as soft as they can be and the mixture should look something similar to this now at this point we're going to turn the heat all the way down to low and we're going to give it a taste and I'm tasting four salts but more importantly I'm tasting four sugar all right depending on how sweet your tomatoes are you're definitely going to need to add some sugar here you may actually need a couple teaspoons in here to get it tasting like you want all right so I tested mine I stirred in some sugar and some salt but I'm not done after this is all blended we're going to adjust this again at the end and then we're going to take our immersion blender and we're going to very carefully blend this absolutely smooth all right this is obviously edited but you're going to let that blend for at least a few minutes until it's as smooth as silk and because of the rice in there the appearance is going to change from red to that more familiar sort of cream of tomato orange color and at this point we're going to add the last major ingredient of the cream all right besides the rice that's the other mandatory ingredient in a bisque it's got a have cream so we'll stir that in not sure why I'm using a spoon a whisk would have been better but it's too late I'm not changing so we're going to stir that in at this point I've taken you as far as I can go alright the rest is up to you you need to adjust this until it's absolutely perfect meaning if it's too thick add some broth if it's too thin reduce it a little or let's switch to a ladle here we're going to need that and then just as important as texture is the taste you got to taste this again like me you may need to add a little more sugar maybe a little more salt who knows you might even put a little more Cayenne in that's been known to happen alright select with most recipes I do not want you just blindly following the ingredient amounts if you want this to work for your taste you have to adjust you are the Sanjay Gupta of your soup duh shoot that was one syllable away from being perfect but anyway what I'm trying to say is a justice with sugar salt and pepper until it's like the best soup you've ever tasted and at that point your tomato bisque is done we're going to ladle that to some hot bowls just put a few bowls in the back of the stove while you're cooking they'll be plenty warm enough by the time you're ready to serve of course you could use a warm oven or maybe just keep them under your sweater but regardless we're going to ladle that up I'm going to garnish with a little more fresh cream on top and some chopped basil just because it goes so perfectly and you may remember this garnish from such tomato based soups as every single one I've ever done and that right there ended up being a beautiful tasting and looking tomato bisque and because we use rice and not a whole bunch of roooar cornstarch I really like the texture of this I think it tends to be a little silkier and smoother and you can see here mine is fairly thick or if you want yours a little thinner put a little less rice or a little more broth like I said very easy to adjust and if you're wondering where the heck is the toasted cheese sandwich it's right here alright everybody knows making tomato soup no matter what kind you're making is simply an excuse to eat toasted cheese sandwiches we're not going to lie that's actual purpose of this in fact control room cue full-frontal and three two oh yeah ok that's enough if you don't mind I'm going to grab a little piece of basil for this last bite that my friends was a beautiful beautiful fall lunch so know you don't need a whole basket of sweet vine ripened tomatoes to make a delicious tomato bisque in fact I will argue this comes out better because you don't but regardless of what kind of tomatoes you end up using for this it's an easy fast and fairly foolproof way to make a delicious and very very comforting and satisfying style of tomato soup I really do hope you give this biscuit rye head over to food wishes calm for all the agreement amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy
