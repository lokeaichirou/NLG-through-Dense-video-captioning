 [Music] leave you got hi guys welcome to my youtube channel Alice yummy food I'm today making very Eastern European and Russian dish called Betty Nikki which are the dumplings I'm not filled with meat which I tell many these will be filled with sweet stuff like jam or cherries or cottage cheese which I'll show you today they actually originally come from Ukraine and read them a lot it might be out there eaten all over Russia and still bring them to you okay the ingredients for the dog really simple and it's the same method of making them as ten mini which I will put the link below we've got 400 grams of plain flour 1 tablespoon of castor sugar a pinch of salt I've got two eggs and a cup of water which will be using depending on how much the dough needs for the fillings of God cottage cheese Russian one and I've got sweet cherries [Music] so I've taken the dough when they talked and whined and now we still need to knead it for quite a while until it becomes really really easy to work with an elastic so just take it hold it take it in just do that put some flour on the surface and it shouldn't stick ok it's all done very easy to work with now very elastic all we have to do is now wrap it in some foil and put it in the fridge for half an hour ok so if my dog's been refrigerated for about half an hour and now all we have to do is roll it out into sort of a big big square and into quite thin pastry so just do it slowly it's quite easy to work with put some flour on okay so just stop rolled it all out I cut the edges off to make a square so I'm going to the same freaking pieces now with a knife or anything sharp you have which is gonna lightly just scroll down and make equal squares okay so I've got my feelings ready I've put some castor sugar into the cottage cheese because I like it sweet you don't have to do that you can make them salty as well so I've got my cherries here so all we have to do is just touch the square then I would say put about two two cherries in the middle and then we just pinch it from the top just like that just down one inside just pinch it from this side as well we need to make sure it stays together otherwise it's going to open while it's cooking I make these kind of triangles just like that and place them on a plate floured plate and do the rest okay these are all done I've got the cottage cheese and cherry filling I've actually also tried some with strawberry jam someone special and so we'll see how that turns out and so I've put my boiling water here I've added a bit of salt in a bit of sugar and because it's pasta so we need to make sure it doesn't stick together so when it starts to boil we're just gonna drop in our betting key in and cook them for about five to ten minutes once they done I'm gonna serve them with some sour cream and jam ok it's all done steaming hot looks absolutely amazing I put some cherries on the side and a cup of Smetana sour cream on top maybe another cherry just to make it look really pretty mmm can't wait to eat this ok I'm gonna dig it in come on open now so when you cut it open you should see the cherries just in there looks good a bit of sour cream these are amazing guys I know what I'm eating for dinner now I hope you try this recipe if you enjoyed it please subscribe to my channel and check out my recipe by [Music]
