 hi everyone this is Stacy with me here I have shack tactical today and want to make a perfect game shoes that people been telling me that if I want to make a perfect cookie I had to talk to you um yeah okay so I mean I'm pretty expert I've been doing since I was basically like 2 years old with my grandma so I learned from the best some people easily say I have the best kimchi in New York City okay so here I have a cabbage how do we make him what are the ingredients okay uh one head of napa cabbage and you know you want to trim the you know outside just like the head here just to clean it up a bit um you just do this I just have yeah all you have to do that and then okay so like that and okay and then I'm for this one I'm probably going to order it just because these cabbages are very big but what just like that and from here my grandma always used to trim the outside of just a little bit just to clean it up about a cup of water and rock salt here and you know a tablespoon you don't get regular kosher socks um I would not I would get the rock salt only because kosher salt has different salt content than the rocks okay it's a lot saltier okay so um if you could I would try to get the rock salt page like this wet it a little bit and then you have to make sure so in fact you every you know because that way it is I know that and then after four hours you'll flip it okay since all eight hours in total yes I would say eight to ten and you really need to taste it make sure it's like if the salt is embedded into the cabbage it on after ten hours I think I oughta moisture went out um so we're going to make the kimchi paste as you call it and um I am using a lot of ingredients but this is very very subtle you add this to your coochie nothing can wrap it up its stride fish right this one is dried cod and then find it in any previous people mark yeah any Asian any supermarket from here I'm gonna add a little bit of warm water just to moisten it up just a little bit it helps it oh I don't shoot now the right is she makes icon me here and this is kind of texture with the yes texture taste and everything yeah but scallion stare no that's probably like one bunch and then apple puree a pepper gray a beret all right you know what you can probably just put it all in a food processor and pull the only ones okay oh this is one echo or get one up one Apple I gotta use one Apple in this um I would say half an ounce a quarter cup here engine yeah and ginger I'll probably only use a tablespoon okay then you don't want it to be too pungent Jackman Scarlett also use probably alerted more than gin ginger like 2 tbsp this is onion puree ok and I'm going to use a quarter cup of this first one is our salted shrimp which is acts like a fish sauce ok a cup of that intro into your fish sauce ok stable amount you can just it think equal amounts Angele fish sauce this is Lance fish sauce okay this is um some plum extract you know or you can use like mirin or something a little bit of sugar that's important this is rice root that I made in advance okay yeah so this is like the heart this makes like tasty equal therefore we like really fine this is this is actually very so much just rice flour that you boil with us you know oil in a pan and little water and some like a plate yes so you just didn't borrow like ten minutes and then he comes yeah so this I'm going to add I'll spell assuming and I even convinced you a lot but this is my first time making one yeah yeah I mean I know it's complicated it is kind of it is quite it seems complicated Susie but now it's actually if you get used to it and yeah that's sugar hi fish I just got back in there oh my god and then Thomas yeah please yeah please cut on a pair of gloves I would love your help a friend you know like I love you with a lot of this red chili plain Lutheran red chili flakes because I like my kimchi spicy bugging you know if your tolerance is Lana's no way that's mine hopefully my seat up yeah yes color yes it's quite risky but you know if you add a good amount of it person it I'll add this Apache mix every get everything really well and then that much and you smell it right I'm like oh no it is actually kinda spicy but you can really smell ya he's ours now don't like um she's like peppery yeah so I just added this isn't very very red very red you kind of want to okay dude it's because that way it becomes a piece and then come here with the pepper smoke something uh fish sauce and liquid from the daikon and all the ingredients it becomes PC so you know you want to give it a circular motion yes circular motion kind of like Robbie Robbie running it and you have this already now it's ready you know you're ready to put this inside okay okay so I'm gonna have you do one okay and I'm gonna tell you one so the case you want together so typically when you do this and you just start around wrapping it start rubbing it and then under each one you want to add sound a little bit of a taste okay with the daikon you know and then you know you just have two little rare it it fun yeah I mean but imagine just yes you would really quantify stash and extradition over just that it's not PR it's just okay for any any type of identical I know you guys match it is falling season Oh mm-hmm hey you're doing a really good job are you sure you never did this before hahaha we all come from seen my ancestors okay but you would how my grandma did it would she would take that out early your coffees you're such a huge right what do you think it's really crunchy really nice really nice and when it happened it's still a spicy sour with a head of sweetness somehow uh-huh on the Apple and you know and then we did put the plum extract it's really good yeah II you know fill it all up we have two more to go school your whole work on that but you forget it I would say for two to three days at room temperature and then you put it in the fridge for five days okay and then that makes the perfect romantic cookie but you know some people like it's very sour and they leave it longer oh that's gonna get out sourness comes from yes exactly you're berating acid so it's almost like a game with it okay just to let you know that I will also put this recipe Esteves if you down in a box below and then if you like the video like our recipe please subscribe to the channel like
