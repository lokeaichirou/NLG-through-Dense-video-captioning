 all right we're going to make some onion rings here's an egg put that in there and we need one tablespoon of vegetable oil we need 1 teaspoon of salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper need some baking powder 1 teaspoon you want to beat this egg up already we need some beer we're going to use at least a cup of the beer probably about a cup and a quarter and next we're going to add cornmeal 1/4 cup of cornmeal you don't have to use that if you don't have it but it's better with it and 1 cup of flour and mix this up you think the batter is too thick which I think it is add a little more beer you want it to be kind of like pancake batter a little bit thicker slightly thicker just slightly but very close to pancake batter just mix this up and I like to I need to mix it up more then cover it with plastic wrap and I like to let it sit overnight before I use it just out in the open not refrigerated or anything kind of let it ferment so we're going to let this sit I don't have overnight to do this I'm going to do this today so it's going to sit for at least an hour and also just a side note I usually use this to make onion rings with this is just add water with this and this is what I usually use but homemade true homemade onion rings now you have my recipe here I have a big onion here's my hand here's my hand here's onion it's big I like to buy big onions whenever I make onion rings and I'm just going to slice this up and then I take the peel off I get that the outer ring off throw that away for all the peel way and then just separate it into rings and there you go okay my batter is ready it's fairly thick I'm going to add onions in there put those in there and drop them one at a time into the oil the hot oil we're going to have onion rings alright yeah the rings have pride about Oh three or four minutes you look good these are really excellent just put them on paper towels to drain them cool off you're like a minute or two there you go
