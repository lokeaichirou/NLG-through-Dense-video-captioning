 I'm dr. BBQ four fire cooker calm this is another recipe I'm going to do today it's it's grilled bratwurst with beer butter and onions and I've added a little garlic to this one too I do it a little different than most folks I don't like the idea of simmering my brats in beer me you're making kind of bratwurst soup that you're not going to eat I like to do it a little different the way I start out is with the butter in the pan on my grill and then I add the onions three big onions for a pan full of brats cuz they're gonna cook way down and today I'm adding a little bit of garlic to it you're not gonna hurt anything probably not mandatory but I like doing that so I'm gonna let these cook for a little while in the butter because they're gonna take a little bit longer than the bratwurst it's been about 15 minutes nice third these onions a couple times they're getting pretty softened up now looking good so I'm gonna add this Guinness to them you can use lighter beer if you want but the dark beer works out pretty well it gives a nice nice dramatic entrance they use what you got laying around you know I usually look in the back of the fridge and find a beer that I never got around to drinking and put that one in there but the Guinness is gives it a nice deep flavor it's a good way to go with the bratwurst so I'll stir that back up and I'll put the bratwurst on I'm putting these brats on I'm gonna cook them but I'm not that worried about getting them done inside because I'm gonna what I'm gonna do I'm gonna brown these bratwurst up now and then I'm gonna take them and drop them into the the bath there with the beer and onions everything a little bit I'll be hot by that so as they get colored up and looking good I'm not that worried about them being completely done on the inside cuz they're gonna finish cooking in there we'll be right back okay he's been cooking for a while it's probably been about 10-15 minutes as you can see I've got some of them already in here in the bath with the onions of the beer then you put them in as they're ready you know they don't all get done at the same time these last few will go in now they're looking pretty good and again you don't have to worry so much about him getting all done push them down in if they're not done quite on the inside yet that's okay because I'm gonna cook them a little bit more I'm gonna cover them with foil and close the lid and then I'm going to let them cook for about 20 minutes with the foil on and then I'm gonna take the foil off because I want those onions and beer to reduce down so I want to get done I've got the brats laying in there with sort of a creamy onion beer mixture we'll see him in a few minutes all right then I cooked him for about 20 minutes with the foil on and then I took the foil off and it's been about another 15 or 20 and you see how they're all it's kind of rendered down now and the onions are all creamed out those brats are soaking in that beer and onions and garlic beautiful we serve them up really pretty easy serving just a bun potato chips my white socks Comiskey Park plate and they honor a baseball you know bratwurst and baseball kind of goes together well grabbed a little bit of these onions out of the pan they're cooked down pretty hard but it makes for a nice plate if you like to put mustard on them go ahead it's not really my thing so I'm gonna eat mine just like this this is my beer my bratwurst cooked with beer butter and onions for rocket for fire cooker calm if you do recipes right here on the page you can see it and you can press that little button and print it off for yourself and go on and cook it for yourself I'm dr.
