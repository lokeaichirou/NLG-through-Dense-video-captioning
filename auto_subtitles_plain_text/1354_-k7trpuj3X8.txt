 hey dudes I'm Hilah welcome to Hilah cooking today I'm gonna show you how to make fried calamari like I learned how to do it from an old Greek lady and it's real easy and there's only a few ingredients but man after you make this like as an appetizer at a party people are gonna be like holy this is amazing and then it's gonna be gone like that so make sure that you actually get to taste them before you take it out to your guests tip from meaning you okay here's what we need so I've got some calamari tubes and some flour salt and pepper and some lemons but get out of here lemons we don't need you right now the first thing to do is put the flour and our salt and pepper in the bag and we'll toss that around later and then so I've got these calamari and these are just the tubes because my ding-dong grocery store didn't have the whole squid so I can't show you like how to separate the squid tubes from the tentacles but but if you had the whole ones and you just like pull out the beak pull out the guts and then cut the tentacles off leave the tentacles whole and then slice the body parts into the little ringlets that you see it like Olive Garden and other fancy places all right so we want to cut these to you about half an inch thick and you want to use a sharp knife yeah get all the way through maybe we got these little two little ring ones blue all right so just throw them in your flour mixture a few pieces at a time and then we'll shake them up and get it coated and I just got a clean plate here that I'll set my little red rings on and just kind of use your hands just to shake off the excess back into the bag cool let's dry these puppies all right so I've got my oil heated up here to 365 and I've just been kind of monitoring it and adjusting it with the turning the heat up and down to keep it stable and I'm going to drop these in I'm need some tongs so that I can kind of like hold them open like this so that I end up with little fried rings and not little fried blobs that are stuck together and don't do too many at once cuz you'll drop your temperature and then they won't get as crispy so yeah double-check my tent to make sure it hasn't dropped too much make sure I don't need to adjust we're still at like 360 so that's good and they shouldn't take more than two minutes that's the key to not ending up with tough chewy calamari like so often times happens it'll probably more like a minute and a half or something and they're popping and like sizzling a lot right now and you'll also notice as they start to cook and just happen magically right then a lot less sizzling and popping goes on so just kind of shoosh um around now you don't have to mess a phone but it kind of gives you more of a purpose when you're standing here slaving over a hot stove let's kind of flip them over they get evenly browned anyway but you know it's something to do alright so you can see like compared to when I first dropped them in and they're all like like little volcanoes squirting everywhere they've really really calmed down a lot you guys are really maturing and your behaviors gotten a lot better since you first went into the oil so I'm very proud of you ok I think those are done check that out it's like golden brown it's just like that and we're all crispy and it's like a little ringlets cute ok so I just got a little paper towel then I'm gonna drain them on first what sec ok so these really don't need anything but a little bit of lemon and I think that's really the best way to serve them just let them cool off for a second so I don't burn the heck out of my you know what my mouth mm-hmm that's awesome that's a great little little snack appetizer or whatever it's as fresh as a day at the beach but like when you first get to the beach not when you leave because by then you're all sticky and covered in sand so there's how to make fried calamari alright I hope you try it and we'll see you guys later
