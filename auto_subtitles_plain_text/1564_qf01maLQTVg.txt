 hey y'all I'm April McKinney and today I'm going to be making something I call weeknight tacos and I call these we might talk week night tacos because whenever I was growing up my mom used to make tacos a lot and it would usually be on the weeknights it was just something quick and easy and we all really liked it and it was usually the kind with the ground beef and then you have the seasoning packet and the taco shells the crispy taco shells and it was just so good and we usually had it with applesauce and it's so funny because I'm actually pregnant I'm almost two months pregnant and I was craving these tacos like a couple weeks ago early cravings I guess but I really I just had to have these tacos I thought I just wanna come up with my own recipe I'll just make my own and so I made these and I even got the crunchy shells and everything and I even served it with applesauce and it just really hit the spot so I thought I would share this with you guys and you can kind of enjoy the fruits of my pregnancy cravings so the first thing I want to do is I want to mix together the seasoning packet obviously I'm not going to use a packet I'm going to show you how to do this with seasonings you probably already have in your pantry one thing you want to start out with is one tablespoon of cornstarch and the rest I'm making right now it's going to feed about three people so you're probably going to want to double this you have like four adults in your family it's a little too much for two people but probably not enough for four so one tablespoon of cornstarch is going in and then you want to get in 1 teaspoon of chili powder right in there I'm going to get some paprika and do also 1 teaspoon of paprika we're also going to get in 1 teaspoon of cumin and this would be a great thing to do if you wanted to like triple this or even quadruple this and just make a big batch of the seasoning that way you've got it you go until you want to make these tacos okay and now I'm going to get in a half teaspoon of garlic powder a half teaspoon of onion powder and a half teaspoon of dried oregano all righty and then we got to have some salt in here sometimes about 3/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper now it's a lot of seasonings but if you look at the back of this package you're going to see a lot of these kind of seasonings on there and it just makes it taste really flavorful and I mean these are so good they're I think they might be even better than the packet kind but you don't have to worry about too much salt in these or you know sometimes on this package you're going to see some ingredients you don't know what they are this you know exactly what's going in it it's just regular spices that you like I said you probably already have in your pantry so just get that mixed up a little bit perfect I'll get these seasonings put away we're going to chop up an onion and I'm also going to make a little guacamole topping for our tacos okay so what I have here is some tomato and avocado that I've just chopped up and then to this I'm going to add some garlic I'm just adding about a teaspoon of garlic and this is going to be a nice little guacamole topping on top of my weeknight tacos my mom didn't usually make the guacamole part I kind of added that in because I just love guacamole but you we usually had you know shredded lettuce and chopped up tomatoes and things like that but this is so simple to whip up and avocados are a lot more common now than they were back in the early 90s all right you can see how that's starting to look like welcome only very very simple especially if you've got a good ripe avocado it just comes together really well now I'm just gonna have a little lemon juice to this normally I'll probably use lime juice but I don't have any lime today so the lemon juice will work well so just get that mixed up the lemon juice is going to add and I tange it's also going to keep the avocado from turning brown so just two things and then a little bit of salt and that is it that is our box from only topping very easy very yummy it's going to be delicious on top of those tacos so now let's go ahead and cook up our ground beef and I'll show you how simple this is okay so I'm now just browning the ground beef I'm using really lean ground beef so there's not a lot of fat in this at all we really don't need a lot of fat in this ground beef because we're going to add so much flavor to it so I'm sure you have all done this before just breaking up the ground beef as it Browns and I did go ahead and buy the crunchy shell I just seriously I had that prepared shells I want it to be just like it was when I was a kid so get the crunchy shell and you put these in the oven at 350 just according to the package that's just going to make it make the shells a little crispier all right once you've got it pretty well broken up I'm going to go ahead and add in my onion and just continue browning the beef until it's all all that pink is cooked out of it so now that the beef is pretty well cooked through I'm going to go ahead and add our seasonings and this also has the corn starch in it so it's about the same amount as a packet of taco seasoning has in it mmm already smelling good bringing back memories I think this might be a new just weekly dish that I make again bringing it back okay so what I'm going to do now is get that in there make sure everything's mixed up well all the ground beef is broken up so what I'm going to do is take a half cup of water just like if they big did with those packets put that in there and I'm just going to go ahead and cover this up and let it simmer for about five minutes with the top on then I'll take the top off and let this simmer for another five minutes and then it would be just really rich and look just like that a weeknight taco that we had as kids so I'll show you what it looks like we get done all right y'all it looks perfect it smells even better and I just can't wait to dig into this I'm going to show you I'm just going to simple one of these I've already got my tacos up the oven my taco shells put a little ground beef in here all right put some of this guacamole actually I do a little cheese first I have fresh grated some pepper jack cheese this is really going to be awesome and then some of my gummy guacamole in here YUM fresh guacamole so this is my new and improved version of the weeknight taco smell amazing it looks so good and I can't wait for you guys to try this one out let me know what you think at the bottom
