 welcome back to two treats this week we're making Wiener schnitzel and noodle Wienerschnitzel is best described as crispy thin meat so the first thing you're going to need to do is pound out your protein we placed our pork chops in between a piece of saran wrap we do this because it protects the outside of the meat from getting mashed and push it up when you're pounding it flat after you're done tenderizing and pounding out the meat you can take some salt and pepper and be sure to spread it evenly on both sides then it's time to set up your batter stations for for pork chops one egg will work perfect in our batter station so we crack that into a pan and quickly whisk it up then we're going to put a flower on one plate and our bread crumbs on the other which we just use from old bread that we toasted and dried ourselves then we take the pork chop basket in the flour dunk it in the egg and make sure you get the breadcrumb spread evenly on both sides when your battering your pork chops its gonna get a little messy so dive right in with those fingers Wiener schnitzel is made with four common proteins on the lean side you've got turkey and chicken and on the other side you have pork and veal if you're staying traditional then you better be using feel because Wiener schnitzel is one of the national dishes of Austria where by law if you're using that name it must be made with veal now there is some debate over when Wiener schnitzel was originally created ranging from between the 15th and the 17th century but we do know earliest recorded record of the use of the word wiener schnitzel was in 1845 in go the pork chops into our nice hot oil be sure to give the pan a shake so that you spread the oil evenly over the pork chops and avoid them from sticking to the bottom well three and a half minutes in and we give them a quick flip for another three and a half minutes as we make a fast salad and grab a wedge of lemon for tradition and then it's time to eat time for canoodle the first thing we need to do is peel our potatoes and be sure to cut out any dark spots you might find they're about the color of a small bruise toss the potatoes and some boiling water and boil them up until they are about fork tender then remove them from the water and allow them to cool before shredding once the potatoes are cooled it's time to prepare our dough grab a potato and a grater or a rice press if you have one and grate up those potatoes into nice thin strips once you do that you're gonna create a hole in the center where you're going to add your flour and the egg the hole is a nice way to keep the egg for running while you're preparing your dough take a spatula and start to mix the potato flour and egg you want to continue to use the spatula to mix it until it begins to bind and clump together once you do that add your salt and then grab it with your hands and start working it together just like a loaf of bread knead the dough back and forth until it continues to bind and turns into one solid ball communal our potato dumplings but can also be made with old bread they're often served as a side dish to meat but they can also be stuffed with clumps for a yummy dessert or served inside a soup they are known around the world for many different names for instance in Czech Republic they're called and hungry they're called in Italy they're called in Luxembourg they are called in the United States they're called overall I call them delicious once your dough has binded and balled up it's time to make the individual dumplings grab off a small chunk of the dough and roll it back and forth in between your hands as we just showed each one of our dumplings was about an inch to an inch and a half in diameter once you finished making your dumplings it's time to throw them back in some boiling water you'll start to float after about 5 to 10 minutes and that means they're just about done once the dumplings are all done grab a slotted spoon and be sure to drain the water from each one place them onto a plate and today we just seasoned ours with some crushed black pepper and a little bit of basil thank you for joining us as we continued our European food tour and stay tuned next week as we continue the international food tour heading east towards Asia if you're on YouTube always remember to subscribe right up above like and favorite this video down below if you're not on YouTube you can always find us on Facebook Google+ and Twitter leave us a comment send us the recipes let us know how we're doing and what you think thank you for watching and always remember to keep on cooking
