 hi I'm Josh summers with high country salmon and today we're going to follow the seventh okay so now we're going to sashimi this bullet and I'll turn it back over again and if we were doing sashimi in the shop here at high country salmon we sort of do it a quick way I'm sure it's slightly different then proper sushi chefs would do it but here in the shop and we go through so much that we have to do it quite fast so what we do is we cut the pin bones out so you want to just put your knife just behind the pin bones there run it along not all the way down just sort of work your way down and the idea is to try and get them out with there's a little flesh stuck to them as possible I should just go right down to the bottom see I've gone right down and it smooth opens it up you know if you just run your finger along you can feel where they end which is about there somewhere and just do the same on the other side it was closing you can get just along like that now this but it's quite tricky the pin bones go down on an angle that way towards the tail diagonally so if you just run your knife sort of diagonally down just sort of feel them where they end just like that game down to the tail end and just lift it up cut that bit off and here we have the Philip really to be cut and sister she me and from here what we're going to do is we're going to cut this the Philip into three pieces so we're going to have the loin which is this top bit here the belly which is the bottom bit and then just the middle piece which would run right down to about right down to the tail we're just going to cut sort of halfway between the top of the spurt and the bottom I'm just gonna run it right down in there and then from there we left with the belly which again we can cut we can cut this again if we wanted to and lines of the first shoulder grain as we say runs that way and then it changes and it goes that way so we just want to cut where you can see the angle changes just like that and just leave with four different pieces just pop those put those aside and just cut each one slightly differently yeah just the mobile piece here most people like it thin and Hoover in some Asian countries and they like it thick so we just want to cap cut it right bit Wolverines this sort of keeping your fingers out of the way is sort of moving them down as you do each cut all the way to the tail and generally we wouldn't use the tail end it gets quite then and also quite quite chewy so we would generally just use these butts we've got we just put those those in a nice nice pile over there like so the next I do the line or the top part of the Philip and this one's slightly different it's got a few ways ways that it can be done but generally it's cut with the green so you can see the lines on it they sort of yeah they're like sort of almost a v-shape and so just go to the air and what we want to do is just sort of cut down on an angle like so display those slide days up there make a bit more room and it's very important let's just concentrate when you're doing this make sure your fingers are well out of the way before you pull the knife back and again generally wouldn't use the in but just for presentation purposes and next we have the top half of the belly so this but you can see the grain runs on an angle that way which would be towards the top heat end of the Philip if it's still on the fish and we want to cut against the grain on this one so because the lines run this way we're going to cut on an angle down that way so just off sorry just like that and you go all the way to the end with this one just put that in a nice pile yeah are these up on the side so you can see watch which parts I fish we've got next we've got the bottom of the belly bit and again we want to run against the grain so tuna over because the grain is running that way and just go like that the spurts generally cut nice and thin and because the belly is a lot chillier than the rest of the fish so the thinner it is a bit of the taste and when cutting sashimi and the Japanese they they cut each individual part of the fish so that each different part is the same texture and feel in the mouth which is why they separate the three different parts of the filler because each one has different grains so it can be cut so that has the same same feel in the mouth and that's how we do sashimi Oh
