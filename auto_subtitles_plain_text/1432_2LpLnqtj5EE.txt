 hi I'm Dennis fear executive chef here at the red clover and men in Vermont and today I'm gonna show you how to prevent escargot the ingredients today for the escargot is we have some sliced chives some brunoise shallots some chart garlic of course escargot some white wine some white stock we're gonna use a little tomato product some heavy cream and a little bit of butter and obviously we'll be seasoning that with kosher salt which you can use sea salt as well both of them work perfect and now we're gonna take this right over to the stove so I can show you how we can say these eschar goes right up so right now we're going to add these Escott rows to the pan we're going to start off with a little bit of the garlic and the shallots then we're gonna add the escargot in we're gonna add a little bit of white wine reduce the white wine down with the snails in the in the pan then a little bit of tomato product finishing off with a little bit of cream some butter and some herbs and we're gonna season this right at the end when we're starting when you start saying pretty much anything you want to start off on a hot pan so here we have a hot pan a little olive oil in it we're gonna add our charlotte's and garlic now this garlic you want to get a little toasty does it mean burnt but you can see how it's just getting nice and brown that's when we're gonna add our escargot toss those a little tomato and a little bit of white wine to this now we're gonna cook this down toasting the garlic like we did in getting it that little bit of brown color gives it a little nutty flavor when you're doing a scampi and some of our other videos you might might have seen you don't want to touch the garlic you want it to be nice and white and that captures the essence of the garlic flavor when you toast it a little bit brings out a different nuttiness to the garlic again we're reducing the white wine which is the evaporation of liquid concentrations flavors also thickens your sauce all right I'm gonna add a touch of heavy cream a few Pat's of butter I'm gonna swirl that in at this point we're gonna season with some salt I'm gonna reduce the heavy cream and then to finish this dish we're gonna add some herbs I'm gonna end with a little bit of chopped parsley you can see the sausage sauce getting nice and thick now get a nice white sauce some beautiful red chunks of tomato specula with the green herbs and this is how you make escargot I'm Denis Vieira executive chef of the red clover and mendon Vermont you
