 did you possibly get one of these for Christmas did you get this for a college gift actually this woman I actually got in college waiver at this thing has lasted me four centimeters it is awesome if you love seafood soups this is a recipe for you nikhat pots are amazing okay they are the ultimate set it and forget it kitchen appliance today I'm going to show you how to make a wonderful clam chowder in a crock pot everyone knows that new Muslim clam chowder is the best clam chowder we do not talk about Manhattan clam chowder at my house okay we don't do that but no slaving away over a stove trying to get your room right or you know dousing it a whole bunch of creams weddings and vegetables this is going to be as easy as putting everything into your crock-pot to loosen the lid traditionally it's made with a lot of butter and a lot of smell Caleta heavy cream and you know we're going to put this on either version we're going to dial the derrick down for us people who may be lactose intolerant you may have a love of clam chowder but because you're lactose intolerant or you're just trying to stay away from Dairy it's not the best option for you you're gonna start out with your low-sodium chicken claws and then you're going to get a box or a can of condensed cream of chicken soup you can substitute cream of mushroom soup if you want but we're going to use some chicken soup just to sit with the theme and then you're going to get your clam juice and your chopped clams and that's going to be like your grocery items your fresh items are going to be your potatoes your celery your onion your fatally is your time and of course no New England clam chowder is a new complaint chatter without some bacon so hopefully your grocery store has it so you can purchase just a couple of strips of bacon my parachute store does which is completely awesome if you have to buy the pack I suggest just sitting it in the freezer but you really only need like one strip naked be sure to read the description box for a list of all the ingredients those you're going to start out by chopping up your vegetables getting them ready for your slow cooker then everything else is pretty much ready for you this is all the work that you have to do so you can up cut up your potatoes celery onion you're gonna pop that snarling it get it all nice and chopped up and then we pretty much just start splitting everything into your clickers but you can layer again if you want my only suggestion is that you leave the clamps to the top if you put it towards the bottom that's where all the heat sources in your crock pot okay it comes to the bottom around the sides so by putting your fins you're not having to come to my castle besides so to start layering in all of the vegetables and then you're gonna swap in your cue deck seat your clam juice and then plant and you're gonna finish it off with a little bit of that chicken stock just to put it up to level remember because this is a slow cooker up they're going to be some liquid that naturally happens well if so just anticipate that you don't use all of it but once again put it on the move key bag put it on low and then let it go I let mine go for my complete work shift okay so I was gone for about eight and a half hours and then I came home this is what I had it was so it smells so good in my house I can't even tell you but I realized that I wanted it just a little bit bigger now this is where you can do you can optionally make a little thickening agent by having some flour and milk of your choice so I have about two tablespoons knowledge and we don't have two tablespoons of almond milk and I'm just gonna stir that together and I'm gonna put that into my crock pot and then I'm going to stir it in there and while I'm in I'm gonna take out the bay leaf just a different zone with the baby flavor it doesn't have to stay now mazels it is on this is a great opportunity for me to get my work at it I like to work out after so I usually do 25 35 40 I take my shower I come back after a long work day okay but what they work out a shower I'm ready to be comforted aren't you going to become pretty not ready to be comforted so I'm gonna sit down and have my soup I actually serve mine with some of my homemade multi-seat bread you gotta check out that recipe right here super amazing super delicious bread but I took care of a couple pieces of multi-seat bread or any other bread or if you're a real ninja there you go for those points a package but I hope you like that really easy to do make if anything able to eat and it'll be ready for you when you come home all right guys stretchy you
