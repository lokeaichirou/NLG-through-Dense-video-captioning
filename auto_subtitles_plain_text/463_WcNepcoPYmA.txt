 hey guys what is up it is Michael from lean body lifestyle we're back today in the kitchen with another video and today what we're going to do is actually make one of the most requested videos ever and that is an oven baked chicken parmesan now this is really easy to make and then at the end of the video I'm going to do another t-shirt giveaway to give thanks to you guys for watching all these videos I really do appreciate it every time you guys watch these so let's go ahead and get started so if you're making chicken parmesan you're obviously going to need some chicken breasts now on this plate I have four chicken breasts and what we're going to do is cut each one in half so we have eight pieces and then after you've cut them in half you can set them on a baking sheet that I already have right here with some aluminum foil on top so now that we have the chicken cut up and out of the way we're going to make the breading so the first ingredient that we're going to use for the breading is a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese and we're going to pour that into a bowl and then we'll add 3/4 of a cup of whole wheat bread crumbs on top of the parmesan and then take a fork and mix the parmesan and the bread crumbs together and as always you can add any additional spices that you want to your breading mixture but today I'm going to keep it simple and just add in some basil leaves next what you're going to do is take two egg whites and crack those into another bowl and now what we're going to do is take one piece of the chicken and take the egg white mixture and just set the chicken and the egg white mixture and really make sure you coat the chicken in the egg white because that is what allows for the breading to stick to it so after you've dipped it in the egg white you're gonna take that right over to our bowl of parmesan and breadcrumbs and coat each piece of chicken one at a time and after you're done coating your first piece go ahead and repeat the process for the remaining seven pieces of chicken so after you're done coating the chicken and you have any left over in the bowl you can scrape that out and sprinkle that on top of all the chicken and then we'll fold our aluminum foil over the top and we'll put our chicken in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes so I'll see you guys when these are done now here we are 40 minutes later what we're going to do is peel back the aluminum foil and take some scissors and cut off the extra part and then what we're going to do is take 1 cup of spaghetti sauce or marinara sauce and dump that on top of the chicken then we'll take three quarters of a cup of low-fat mozzarella cheese and sprinkle that on top of the chicken and the sauce now what we're going to do is put these back into the oven uncovered still at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes or until the cheese melts so I'll see you guys in a couple minutes and now 5 minutes later the cheese has melted so I'll put one of these on a plate to give you guys a better view at home and here's a better look for you guys to see at home of this oven baked chicken parmesan I added a side of broccoli but if you wanted to add maybe some pasta to make this more like an Italian dinner feel free to do that but the bottom line is this chicken parmesan is gonna taste great so I hope you guys try this one out and enjoy it because it really does taste delicious and now on to the giveaway all you have to do is like the video and answer the question what is your favorite junk food or a cheat meal so if you have a favor one that you like to indulge in every once in a while let me know down below in the comments and I'll pick someone out send you a message and let you know that you want the shirt but as always if you guys enjoyed this video give it a like and you can stop by Facebook and Twitter links are down below in the description thank you all again for watching and I'll talk to you next time but
