 today I'm making a BLT sandwich potato just regular bacon lettuce and tomatoes get a twist when I'm making it so just for a little bit of olive oil in the pan and now I'm just kind of grilling these tomatoes in this pan I want to get the maximum flavor out of them usually you always use Tomatoes raw just as is but I just want to add that little added dimension of cooked a slightly charged tomatoes yeah so the tomatoes are looking lovely and now I'm going to cook the bacon you can do this in the oven but you know I'm gonna do this in the frying pan it's just easier this way I don't need to put on the oven right now okay so just spread the oil around and now it's time to fry up the bacon you could smell this right now so the ones that are nice and crisp I'm just gonna put it on this paper paper towel to drain but it's also flavor that is Weaver now all we have to do is just put together this sandwich you've got some Mayo here you don't need too much I'm just going to spread this on the bread and but I really like adding to it is just a dash of Worcester sauce no more otherwise it's just going to overpower all the other flavors of the bacon specially this way it just complements the flavor so now spread this bread and you know what makes all the difference when you're making a sandwich is the bread that you've got try to get the freshest possible bread and you know I'm making it as is if you like you can toast this bread you can grill it it's nice any rich way it's just such a classic sandwich how the first beer is of lettuce I always like to leave the stalk out tomahto is that's it you know this is just as simple as that there's not too much going on here but just these few ingredients are going to give us so much flavor and at this point just sprinkle on some salt and pepper now I'm going to put bacon this is a bit enough for me and that is your BLT sandwich you
