 welcome in my cooking channel check cook pork and today we will be making potato goulash growing up my mom used to make this pretty often because you don't use regular beef as you would for beef goulash but you just use a cabassa which is less expensive and that's what we enjoy in it it's one medium onion and here we have potatoes because it's potato goulash we have 4 medium potatoes and this is amazing these are from my own garden I go both heroes for the first time and look at them it's amazing these are golden potatoes but you can use any potatoes you have and if you don't have medium ones just get 3 big ones you will see then we need 1 tablespoon of olive oil now we need this Cabasa you can get either polish kielbasa or here I have a turkey kielbasa doesn't really matter and this is the fancies then we have 2 tablespoons of paprika I like to use Hungarian paprika it's really good then we have 5 cups of water and you can use either beef stock if you have or if you don't have just use water and then use this beef days 1 tablespoon then we have a little bit of black pepper the 1 tablespoon of salt and when I was growing up my mom didn't make it spicy but I just like a little bit of spicy so I add a tiny bit of cayenne pepper but you have to be careful and if you don't want spices just forget about it and just use use use get out it and then for our flower base we will need another water so this time is 1 cup water 1/2 cup of flour and to spice it up at the end it's 1 tablespoon of margarine marjoram is not very spicy but it will bring the nice flavor so let's start first thing we will do we will slice our onion I already filled it and you want to make it on small pieces so I don't think I ever showed you guys how I slice my onion to make it kind of small chunks so cut it like this don't go all the way to the end so it doesn't fall fall apart on you just make up thin lines and now this holds together because you didn't go all the way to the end and now you have a control over it how thick or thin slices you want so let's do a really thin ones so it goes really really well when your end of it super small slices I put the onion in the pot and now I like to prepare all the ingredients ahead of time so what we will do next we will peel our potatoes and cut them on small pieces potatoes are peeled and washed now we can cut it in small pieces about this big this way it will cook faster and we like smaller potato chunks next thing I like to prepare ahead of time is cut this this claw possum so what I do I like to cut it like this like lengthwise and now you just cut it for my mouth ingredients are cut and ready and now we can start cooking this is pretty fast meal you just pretty much wait till the potatoes are soft and then it's done let's add one tablespoon of oil and turn on the flame and let's fry this onions and you will have to steer it pretty often but keep it on high because if you do it on low then onions gets cooked but doesn't really get fried and crispy the onions have a nice color so the pot sees but this is stainless steel pot and that's what happens but it's much healthier since Teflon so let's turn off the flame and they'll be adding 2 tablespoons of paprika and you don't want to add it while it's on the flame because paprika can burn and then becomes bitter we are adding 2 tablespoons this is hard to measure because it's hard to come out sometimes you make a big mess but it's ok 2 tablespoons of paprika let's do it a little bit and turn on the flame but put it on lower what number 6 because we wanted a little bit to fry it but don't burn it to give a better flavour just a little bit that's good and now let's add five cups of water with the flame on high let's add more ingredients we have one tablespoon of salt a little bit of pepper and a little bit of cayenne pepper I want to put really little the potatoes doesn't splash you can add also the Cabasa so it's already the flavor gets into into the calash and now and then come and steer it and wait till it starts to boil it starts to boil so let's add one tablespoon of this beef base it's a organic beef base without msg so it's not bad for you and if you want to know which kind of music you can go under the video click on the link and I have products that I'm using and you can purchase it put it on lower about number six but have it still boiling a little bit now we'll wait till the potatoes are almost done and in a min meantime we will prepare our flour mixture for our flour mixture this will help to thicken up the sauce because it's not a soup so it has to be a little thicker so we have 1 cup of water and half cup of flour let's put it all together and with the whisk just mix it together so I don't have big clumps it doesn't take long and the potatoes are almost done so now that we'll be adding a flour mixture I recommend using using this strainer because you don't want to have a big chunk so this is the water and flour so let's add this but also have and then stir it right away see this is all that would end up in the goulash and wouldn't be pretty let's put this on higher a little bit and this will thicken it up but keep steering last thing we will be adding and is one tablespoon of margarine which is a great herb and in check that a lot of flavor keep stirring and cook it for a little bit so we have a time to have this sauce thicken up our potato goulash is done doesn't it look amazing it's so good and it was super fast too and super easy
