 to begin with this quick and easy recipe we're going to start off by boiling potatoes in a big pot I'm using a lot of potatoes because I am making a big batch of these so you can use as many as you want in a mixing bowl you can start off by putting two and a half cups of all-purpose flour along with the flour you can also add one tablespoon of cumin seed saw is literally the preference of the person but we've added two teaspoons of salt and this then we're also adding a quarter cup of oil as of right now you want to go ahead and start mixing and you want to mix all of the oils and everything to the point where if you were to motion in your hands you'd start to get chunks in them we need the dough to be hard and not soft so we're slowly adding water to what we want to do with it once out of the flour has been just combined together you want to go ahead and start kneading this on a counter just so you can break everything down completely and mix everything in your hands and this is how the consistency should look if you can get a wet cloth and just place it on top of that it'll be great because that's going to avoid it from getting hard at the top now for the filling you're going to need salt cumin seed and red chili pepper the other ingredients you'll need are freshly chopped cilantro freshly chopped mint and you're going to need some green chilli peppers all of these vegetables came from a frozen pack you can pick these up at your local grocery store and they're very inexpensive so I am going to be using green beans carrots and peas then you want to go ahead and start mashing all your potatoes up try to keep them to the point where you have chunks in them now in a frying pan you want to use quarter cup of oil and then you want to drop in all your cumin seed and let it fry up on top of that you're going to add in all of the vegetables and just stir them around for about five minutes once you're frozen vegetables are ready you can go ahead and add them into the mixing bowl with the potatoes add in your pepper your saw and the freshly chopped up herbs mix everything very well because you want all of the flavors to be distributed evenly throughout the samosas to start with the wrap of the samosa we're going to be rolling our dough into little golf sized balls and then we're going to flatten them out to the texture and the softness and the flatness and everything to the size of a tortilla keep rolling until the dough becomes really really flat if your rap isn't perfect you can go ahead and just cut off the edges to make it a circle and then cut it in half so you have a half of a circle and then you want to put water around the straight edge and fold them together into a little triangle make sure you place one flap over the other and then you want to press against the flap so when you deep-fry them they won't open up and all of the vegetables won't come out of it so press as hard as you can so they completely stick together then you're left with this cone start filling that in with the potato mix using water again we're going to be applying that on the rim of the samosa and then we're going to close them together have grabbing one end of the samosa and bringing it forward to the edges that were connected to the flaps that we're connected you want to keep that side on the front and then just close the back of it towards the front and then just press against the bottom and you've made a samosa now deep-frying is pretty typical you just turn on the stove and let the oil heat up and then just deep-fry it and there you go that's your samosa all right guys if you like this video please don't forget to thumbs it up also leave any comments down below and don't forget to subscribe to mom's kitchen 2011 we'll see you in our next video with another recipe
