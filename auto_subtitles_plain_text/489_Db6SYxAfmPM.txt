 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with how to blueberry pancakes that's right we always get a ton of food wishes for breakfast recipes and it's come to my attention that many of you are not doing blueberry pancakes properly so let me show you what I consider to be the ultimate method for blueberry pancakes and while we're doing this I'll explain why the other methods aren't as good so step one you're going to make a batch of your favorite pancake batter we have several on the blog that are fantastic so check those outs and you're going to ladle that into a preheated skillet I usually cook my pancakes on medium-high and as we're forming that you'll probably notice there are new blueberries in the batter what we're going to do is place them on top and by place I mean throw down wind up from like a foot away and throw them down I want deep impact I want them embedded into the batter just like that so right off the bat using this method you're going to get perfect blueberry distribution because you're controlling where they go and if you're thinking why didn't you just put them in the batter no that doesn't work as good first of all the gobbles berries mixed in evenly you're probably over mixing your batter plus as you're labeling the blueberries will settle and then some pancakes will have like 20 blueberries some will only have like 3 I brunch guests get upset words are exchanged hands are thrown long story short you're out of the will thanks going so this is a much safer method so you're gonna go ahead and throw down as many blueberries as you like and yes I'm just doing one for filming purposes but even if you have a large skillet with for pancakes going those are going to take 2 or 3 minutes before the ready to turn so you have plenty of time to throw down your blueberries when you get down to those last couple open spots you can push them in but the throwing is the most fun part of the project and by the time your blueberries are placed your pancakes should be ready to flip and you know the signs the edge of the pancake starts to look cooked and dry and those bubbles will come up to the surface so at that point we're going to flip it over and then besides perfect distribution as we talked about earlier the real magic to this method is the direct contact of the blueberries to the skillet so instead of them being insulated by the batter and just sitting in the middle of that pancake just barely getting warm in a couple minutes it takes to cook this side of the pancake those blueberries are getting hot they're getting sweet they're getting juicy which is just not going to happen as easily if they're stuck in the middle of the batter I mean a couple might be touching the bottom but using this method they're all getting sweet and juicy so I think it works much much better than mixing them into the batter and of course if you want to show off your hot and juicy berries you can leave it facing up like that put on your butter and syrup but I'm kind of your purist I'm going to flip mine over oops clean it up of course I'm going to spread on a little more butter that melted and some maple syrup and then as we cut in you're going to see not only the perfect blueberry distribution but more importantly you can see that blueberry juice mixing with the syrup I'll say one last time the berries are hot they're juicy and they're sweet so anyway just a quick and easy tutorial on how to properly blueberry a pancake do not mix them into the batter this works much better not only does every pancake have the same number of blueberries using this method each forkful has about the same number of blueberries and by the way you restaurants that are just dumping blueberries on top of pancakes and calling them blueberry pancakes those are not blueberry pancakes those are pancakes so that doesn't count blueberry pancakes have blueberries in them and when it comes to blueberry pancake integration you can't go wrong with this method so I really hope you give it a try head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
