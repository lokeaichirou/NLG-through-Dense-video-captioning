 hello today we're making meatloaf this is a recipe that I make quite often and just like any kind of meatloaf it can be really individualized to your own specific tastes put whatever you want in it but this is what I generally put in mine as a filler I put 1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats although you could use large flake oats as well to this I add 1 teaspoon of salt about a teaspoon of pepper about 1/2 cup of milk 2 beaten eggs and some garlic powder I guess that's about a teaspoon and I put some minced dried onion because max doesn't like the fresh onions too much in there so it doesn't seem to mind the dried onions and a few shakes of Worcester sauce and they're going to blend this together now really the only really good way to blend meatloaf is with your hands so that's we're going to do next ok there's two schools of thought as far as meatloaf go some of them say you should just hardly mix that at all mixing it just barely and leave the meat alone I like to mix the meat very very well mix ingredients in very well and work the meatloaf until you it gets very smooth it changes the consistency of the meat you'll get more of a compact loafie kind of texture to the meat after it's cooked if you work it quite a bit I like that you may not so you do what you want then take a large baking pan and you're going to form it into a loaf shape now what I do is on the top the top I kind of flatten out a little bit and I make it kind of into very shallow kind of shape if you can imagine so that there's like an indentation on the top now this is just so that when you pour the sauce over top that it holds it in now this is my sauce that I make I don't usually measure well you kind of pour it into the bowl but I measured it just to see how roughly what the quantities were that's about a cup of ketchup I add about two heaping tablespoons of brown sugar and about tablespoon and a half or so of prepared yellow mustard and about a tablespoon of Worcester sauce and stir this together and this is what's going to go over top of the meatloaf and you'll see that the sauce whilst the sauce will stay on the top of the meatloaf because you created a little spot for there it is just out of the oven you want to bake it for about an hour until a meat thermometer pushed into the center is at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit that way you know that it's safe T then you just let it rest for about 15 minutes and then you can slice it up you
