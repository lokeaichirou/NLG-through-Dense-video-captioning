 some cities require absolutely no introduction in London's one of them it's a busy city full of postcard sights royalty and over 8 million people who enjoy everything this world-class city has to offer including West End theatres the arts shopping gorgeous parks championship soccer and yes I have to say it great food now you may not think of fish &amp; chips as great food but they're easily one of England's most iconic dishes they're served in virtually every pub on every street but I'm going to take you to one of the very best fish and chip shops in the city it's easily accessible from any nearby underground station by the way the tube which is what they call it is the easiest way to get from anywhere to London's Victoria Station which is right down the street from where we're going for dinner and that would be C fresh London Big Ben Buckingham Palace Westminster Abbey the Tower of London and the Queen and what's for dinner tonight oh come on you kidding me it's fish and chips of course what else back at home fish &amp; chips has always been one of my favorites so just before I flew across the pond I did my homework I discovered that see fresh restaurant right across the street here in central London has some of the best fish and chips in all of England there's absolutely no way I was gonna miss out on this golden tender and crispy opportunity to taste one of this country's most famous dishes there's something fishy going up there I'm gonna check out this place it's real clean and simple just fish and chips pretty much what you're getting and a lot of good company the menu has different kinds of fish you can have fried or grilled and I asked which of the fish they'd recommend for my fishing ships and they said Cod over both cod is definitely the way to go they're big white flakes unlike haddock which are a little bit smaller and it's so sweet and tender and crispy on the outside which is exactly how fish and chips ship everybody here has been terrific I had a great time you can hear from all the noise in the background everybody else is having a great time - hey you're in luck you don't have to come all the way to London make great fish and chips at home I've got some great recipes for you first stop back the seafood department at Nino's a team I'm doing some fish and chips tonight what have you got you got some Cod oh don't look great those are pretty good side what size filets are those alright give me two of them alright don't be late 6 o'clock English Fish and Chips they're not only a classic dish they're practically synonymous with England itself to the English there is iconic as well Big Ben injustice sacred as Westminster Abbey which means they'd better be authentic and that means batter dip not breaded fried not baked fresh not frozen definitely big fillets not sticks or Nuggets and that's for the chips well they're not the kind of potato chip we normally associate with that word rather they're fresh russet potatoes and those would be Idaho potatoes which are generally cut into fat sticks there I call them french fries and then double fried but more about that later with that said how about we give it a toss let's head over to the kitchen where I've got everything we need ready to go both of my recipes are beyond simple so you might be tempted to add additional ingredients to make it better don't it really won't improve these recipes extra ingredients will just make them different so what fish do I use while the two most common fish used for fish and chips are Cod like this piece right here and haddock but I prefer Cod and apparently so do my English friends specifically fresh cod fillets about 4 to 5 inches long and about a half an inch to 1 inch thick the batter itself is very easy just place 1 cup of all-purpose flour in a medium sized mixing bowl with a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper 1 teaspoon of salt and then whisk in an equal quantity of beer which would be about a cup the final consistency should be that of a thin pancake batter pretty easy huh hey let's talk about it for a second first of all for all of you on a gluten-free diet you're in luck because rice flour and a gluten-free beer will actually work and by the way regular Budweiser or Bud Light are said not to be gluten free but there are others that are speaking of beer I prefer nail like this one it doesn't have to be English but what the heck it can't hurt huh a pilsner bill will also work well but I'd stay away from stouts I find them a little too bitter and it ruins the delicate flavor of the fish whichever beer you choose though I recommend you allow the finnish batter to rest about an hour before using it this will reduce some of the fizziness which gives you a better crust in the end next to egg or not to egg well you may find that some batter recipes call for an egg mine doesn't it's not necessary granted an egg can help the batter to stick to the fish a little bit better but the downside is that it can also make the crust more doughy and less crisp okay my batter is rested for about an hour let's go fry some fish you know you're going to find it's a whole lot easier than you think okay I know I'm lucky to have a deep fat fryer but you don't need one in your home just simply take a medium sized saucepan in about a quart of canola oil or vegetable oil and heat it to about 350 degrees and that will work just the same as my deep fat fryer will so to start your fish I've actually taken some more flour with salt and pepper and I placed it in a shallow bowl and what you're going to do is you're going to take your fish fillet that I've cut you're going to place it in the flour and you're going to bread it or flour it on both sides okay after you've done that you're going to simply just grab the corner shake off any excess flour and place it in your batter you want to make sure that it gets coated really well on both sides this batter like I said before is about the thickness of a thin pancake batter we're going to let it all drip off that's important because if you leave all that excess batter on and let it into the oil what's going to happen is all that batter is going to kind of blow off the side of the fillet and that's not good so we've shaken this a little bit just very carefully lower it into the fat I'm not letting it touch the bottom quite yet until it starts to firm up then I'm going to just kind of lay it down just like that so already you're going to see that after a moment or two they're going to start to float a little bit and that's because the batter starts to expand a little bit and create some air inside of it and that's good because it's going to make the final fillet nice and crispy that's it we're going to let this cook for about six to eight minutes we're going to turn over once in the process okay it's been about eight minutes or so I turn these over once on each side so they've been frying in each side about four or five minutes and they look great they look nice and crispy what you want to do now is to just lift them out carefully how golden-brown those are just tap it slightly on a little bit of absorbent paper towel and that would be one portion of fish right there alright we're going to make our chips now now chips aren't french fries they're more like fat your regular shape which is like they're chipped from a potato that's how they get their name we're going to do is we're going to start out with a russet potato which you would know is in Idaho and whether you use a potato peeler or use a knife and I'm sometimes more comfortable using a paring knife than I am a potato peeler you're going to trim off all of the skin you can leave little on if you like but definitely take the eyes out of the potato those are not something you want to have left in there alright so we get our potato trim just like this and typically you're going to want to cut them about Oh 3/8 of an inch thick I take the extra corner off here and I will then cut them just like this we're getting something like that now what I want you to do is you're going to take some water some cold water maybe the little salt in it and you're going to place your chips in the water and you're going to let them rinse for a while okay and then after that we're going to take them out and place them on to a couple layers of paper Tom we're going to Pat them dry I'm going to let them sit after that for a few minutes to make sure they're really really dry that's very very important and after that we're going to double fry them I'm going to show you that in a minute okay my chips are nice and dry been patting them down for a couple of minutes I'm going to lift them off carefully into my basket or you can put them into a skimmer and lower them into your fat if you have a quart sized pan with some oil in it and I have set this at two hundred and ninety degrees not much lower than you normally fry french fries but these are not going to be actually cooking to turn brown they're going to be cooking to just take the flesh and make sure it's nice and tender so we're going to drop it into the oil you see it's not making all this great noise and lots of bubbles and steam coming up because the temperature they all is much lower than it normally is we're going to let those cook for about three or four minutes until they're nice and tender on the inside and then we're going to pull them out and let them rest again after they've rested a few moments we're going to turn the temperature the fat up to 350 degrees just like we did the fish and we're going to fry them until they're golden brown and we've got chips okay it's been about four or five minutes and my chips have been frying at 209 degrees I want to show you this look at how light they are they're not dark at all and that's good that's because it were rinsed really well and they are tender and cooked on the inside but they haven't browned on the outside so what I'm going to do now and you could do this hours ahead of time if you wanted to even put them in the refrigerator if you like is we're going to let these sit you may have seen when you go to restaurants that before they're french fries are fried they look like this and that's why they're nice and fluffy on the inside tastes like potato and they're brown on the outside they're blanched first and that's what we've just done so I'm going to let these rest for a minute while I turn the temperature my fryer up to 350 degrees and then we're going to return these back and fry them up to the golden-brown and our fish and chips are done okay the chips been frying for about four or five minutes they're nice and golden brown so we're going to shake off the excess oil don't want any of that place them on some absorbent paper towels give them a little salt I use sea salt and then add them to our plate us like that a little bit of tartar sauce and there you have it traditional English fish and chips doesn't get any better than that because they're so easy they're traditional I hope you enjoyed this I sure enjoyed it because I love fish and chips this is Pete Lorin director of culinary
