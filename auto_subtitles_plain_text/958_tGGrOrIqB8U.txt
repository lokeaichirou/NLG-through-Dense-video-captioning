 hi I'm Natasha and today we're going to be poaching eggs to make eggs benedict we're going to do that using the castle on egg poacher this makes poaching eggs beautiful and very easy to do you'll notice that each Cup has perforated insides you can do one egg or you can do all six like we're going to do today I have each of my eggs in a ramekin and I'm just gonna gently slide each egg into its cup the reason you want to keep each egg separate is just in case you get any shells you're not going to hurt the egg and it allows you to discard any eggs if you break the yolk I have about an inch and a half of water underneath at a nice steady simmer with some vinegar and some salt once all the eggs are in you're going to cover it with this lid this looks perfect because it's glass and you can watch the eggs poach it's gonna take about three to four minutes our eggs are ready so let's remove them from the pan since we did six eggs we're gonna use this Center handle and just lift all of them out at once to make it much easier if you've done individual ones you can even lift them out by this handle on the side of each Cup now we're ready to put our eggs benedict together we're gonna start with a piece of sourdough toast and we're gonna spread on some of our green onion compound butter once this is on we're gonna use ham today but you could certainly use smoked salmon or if you'd like to do a vegetarian one you could do grilled vegetables or tomato and avocado now we're just going to delicately place our beautifully poached eggs from the cow flop egg poacher and then we're going to finish with some hollandaise sauce we're going to drizzle some on top and then a little bit around the edge and then let's garnish it with some green onions and a sprinkle of paprika our eggs benedict is done the castle on egg poacher is easy to use and I know you'll have great results at home
