 hi story Infante your Vegas morning blend resident chef and today I'm going to be making Chinese spring rolls today's ingredients are ground chicken wood ear mushrooms which are also known as black fungus I have fresh taro and carrots sugar fish sauce garlic green onions salt and pepper of course the spring roll wrappers and some cornstarch and water hi today I'm going to be making Chinese spring rolls and now it's different from Vietnamese spring rolls spring rolls in Chinese in the Chinese culture typically means egg rolls at least that's how I grew up knowing it is so today I'm actually making my auntie Mary's chicken spring rolls and these are amazing i love them okay now I've got the spring roll wrappers and you're going to get the 10 inch ones and you're actually gonna cut them into fours okay so it was a big sheet and I've cut them into four so there's smaller squares ok I'm going to set that aside now when you're actually going to be starting this there's something called wood ear mushrooms if you take a look that looks kind of like an ear right kind of trippy it's also known as black fungus now it comes dry just like this and what you're going to do is wash it in cold water and then afterward you're going to put hot boiling water on it and you're going to let it soak in a reconstitute and one little mushroom like this will become one giant one like this okay so just follow the directions on the back of the bag alright let's put that aside now if you've never seen taro this is a big taro root and sometimes they have taro chips which is really really good you cut this nice and thin but this actually has like a brown skin on the outside and I went ahead and cut it off and I just chopped it up okay and made it into little cubes but this is great you can find this in the Asian markets okay all you have to do is stick all of this inside of a preprocessor this will save you a lot of time on chopping because sometimes when you make egg and stuff like that it actually takes a long time to chop everything up so we're just going to put all this in I did about three quarters of a cup of taro and one large carrot which is almost the whole cup okay all right i'm going to add that in and you're going to add the wood ear mushrooms and i'm doing about three or four wood ear mushrooms i mean if it's a small piece add another one okay and i'm also going to be putting in the two cloves of garlic just smash that in now i'm going to go ahead and just appear right oh this smells so wonderful and if you see like maybe like one or two pieces of large carrot just take them out you can throw them out all right so I'm gonna set that aside take this off if i can get it off there we go all right put this over here now I've got my ground chicken already okay we're gonna go ahead and just add it right in and it's nice to see how fast that when you use a little of processor it's so much quicker just get rid of that now this just makes a lot easier now the ground chicken you can either brine it yourself you can have your butcher do it or a lot of the Chinese markets also have ground chicken okay all right put that in I have about 1 tablespoon in 1 teaspoon of fish sauce I also have one tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of sugar that kind of balances it out okay stir that around I'm also going to add a little bit of salt and pepper to that so this is going to be about a teaspoon of salt and probably like a quarter teaspoon of black pepper like using my hands for everything all right you're gonna get it all mixed up now i'm also going to add some green onions to it about four stocks i'm going to mince it up really small put that right in this looks beautiful just get it all mixed up and if you see any large chunks like that just pull it right out all right all right so you're going to get you're going to get your little wrapper and you're going to make sure that it's like a diamond okay like it's facing you like a diamond so the corner so you're going to do about probably less than a teaspoon of filling inside okay and you're going to kind of like it's going to stretch out so as you're pushing it you don't want to be like fat you want to be longer okay so it will elongate itself and if you feel like you need a little more thoughts fine put a little bit more now I made a corn starch like a little slurry nice and thin so it's actually become a paste okay so I'm just putting some on the edges and this is something that you're going to be using your fingers a lot so don't don't be afraid of it okay and the cornstarch is really just going to help it be like kind of like a glue okay and i love these to be tiny little cocktail cocktail um egg rolls and I'm also putting some right on the corners on the edging so when you fold it up it'll stick okay I know the little edges are sticking out all right auntie Mary I hope I made you proud now after you've made about maybe 60 or 70 of those I know it sounds like a lot but these are a labor of love I actually have a bunch already that I froze and I made ahead of time and we're just going to deep fry some okay get some of this out of the way all right so I got some frozen ones I'm just going to put them right in and again you're going to have your your oil at about 350 and remember that trick you're going to use the tip of your chopstick and going to stick in the oil and when it's all bubbly you know it's ready to go all right oh look at how fast that is already have some ready for you guys and I'm serving it with little sweet chili dipping sauce these are delicious and these are going to be the hit of every single party that you throw with these delicious Chinese spring rolls this is dorian Fong your Las Vegas morning blend
