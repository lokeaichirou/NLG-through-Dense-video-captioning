 what's up everybody welcome to make this your online cooking show in which I show y'all how to make some food now today we will be making something called called e beef aka Korean short rib BBQ you may have had this over at a Hawaiian barbecue like as you can say such as an Ellen Ellen Ono's or any other Hawaiian restaurant out there but today I will be doing my version of it so sit back relax and here come the ingredients alright so the very first ingredient we're gonna be needing in Kobe beef is obviously the beef part and here we have Korean style short ribs if you can't find it in your grocery store ask the ear butcher these cool enough to cut them as you can see there's three bones here and this is actually the short rib area so it's a good cut next we're going to need one small onion right here I'm using a sweet onion but you can also use use a yellow onion just one small one we're also going to need mirin aka a rice wine and we have about 1/2 cup here next we're gonna have to use a sesame seed oil sauce potent we're all using about two tablespoons right here next we have a cup of soy sauce we also have half a cup of water kind of smooth soy sauce we have next a cup of firmly packed light brown sugar or golden brown sugar here now it asks for garlic but my little twist is like using shallots I have one large shallot here just nicely diced up if you can't get shallots or if you don't wanna use shallots use about four cloves of garlic chopped up roughly like this and the last ingredient is something called an Asian pear kinda looks like an apple but it's really a pear only use one if you can't get this I don't know really what to say this ups to maybe not so much of a Granny Smith maybe a Granny Smith with a half a cup of I don't know I don't know I haven't really thought about that but maybe use a pear another different type of bare pear but we have one cut up so here are all the ingredients these right here sesame seed oil rice wine they came nearing brown sugar shallots small onion soy sauce and the short ribs itself oh one more thing you always need pepper I always have this around and this is what we're going to be using to make our Kobe beef so I'm gonna show you how to put this all together so here are the steps to make call dpph actually what we're really making right now is the marinade for it so I'm what we're gonna do now is take all our wet ingredients and throw them into this bowl and my wet ingredients I mean our soy sauce our half cup of water you can try to mention that earlier our sesame seed oil next we're gonna put our mirin or rice wine in here that should be it for all the wet ingredients now next I'm gonna add here is the brown sugar because I want to dissolve it in the liquid so we're gonna give this a quick stir all right now we're gonna start adding our other ingredients that are vegetables and everything so I'm gonna throw the onions in there and the shallots side now for the Asian pears you can just dump them as whole sometimes I'd like to crush them if you can if you want help kiss on that juice out but I'm just gonna throw them in like this now we're going to sit in here and we're gonna prepare the meat all right so the next part of the procedure for all this is preparing the meat you can't leave it as is and throw it in the marinade but I like to cut them up into three equal pieces and then have a marinade it's just personal preference you can leave like this I like to think of smaller so how we're gonna do that is we have three bones here what we're gonna do is cut in between them something like this so I want to do that to mine like I said leave them as whole personal preference so after I cut them up I'm just gonna throw them into this marinade we have right here we cut out the short ribs into three equal pieces or not equal but two pieces to me the marinade now use your best tools your hands and start mixing them in the marinade that's merge all the meat in there alright when everything is nicely covered we're gonna let this sit here and marinate for at least four hours obviously the longer the better but we're just gonna let this marinate four hours or more probably overnight you can all right guys our meats been marinating for a while there there's the meeting right there it's been marinating for four hours already now the way I'm gonna cook there's a lot of ways cooking it you can grill it I wanted to grill it but where I live it's hot so I said screw that I'm gonna do it in a pan I wanted to use my cast-iron skillet pan but I couldn't find it so next best thing and I want to cook about three of them you can get two II get the idea afterwards but I'm going to show you what it is and you know see our meat nice hot pan and they're going there you go so what's good about this is that this is gonna hook up fairly quickly dad all you guys gonna see behind it maybe flip it once that's it so let's get this tough to pinch so let's go underneath of it hangover please this up does not take that long to cook it's actually done so I don't know maybe about two to three minutes a side just watch it have a nice crust color on it there you go better view nice crust color like I said this stuff cooks fast so you can do it on a pan on the grill outside however you want and basically it guys so that's how you cook it let's go see the hint brought up there it is guys Kobe beef aka Korean short rib BBQ that's what looks like no front or front Oh close that's good give a little try what I like about it is that there's a with the onions you can taste a little bit of the onions a little bit of rice wine but there's like it's not overly sweet you figure without that fruit I guess I'm safe from the sweetness from the pear and the brown sugar will be overly sweet but not it's actually a nice blend a nice balance to it anyways I'm gonna say is try this out do you guys like what I'm doing like it share it subscribe all down here and if you don't I don't care so until next time remember eat
