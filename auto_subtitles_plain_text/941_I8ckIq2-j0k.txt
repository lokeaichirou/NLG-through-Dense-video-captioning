 hey dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah cooking we are making fish and chips super crispy the crispiest fish and chips you will ever eat just like they served in you Old England just like probably Sherlock Holmes a except definitely better because I'm making them and I'm making it with love damn it we're gonna start with chips part I've got some russet potatoes here that I cut up about this size I like them about as thick as my finger and about twice as wide but it's a little bit you know it's up to you some people like a bigger like steak fries but I think that's a little too much so they've been soaking in cold water for about 30 minutes and now I'm just going to dry them off on a clean towel the soak in the water helps make them really crispy because it draws out some of the excess starch on the surface okay so then just sort of kind of the same trick that you use like if you're making potato latkes and stuff like that just want to roll it up in a towel and give it a little squish just to get all the water off good deal okay we can kind of just set those aside for now and make our fish fry better for that I've got some flour and some baking powder salt and pepper I'm going to add a little bit of cayenne pepper totally optional and a little bit of dill and honestly you don't really taste this it just looks really pretty in the final product but you could totally skip it or if you wanted to add any other spices of your choosing that's fine maybe some curry powder it would even be a fun little variation then I've just got some plain old soda water you could use beer um but I'm using soda water and this is sort of like a tempura batter and it's just basically water and flour and then we're going to add in a couple of ice cubes some recipes you'll see add egg to the better but I think that that makes it a little bit chewy I like this because it's definitely very light and crisp and that's what I like and my fish and chips but I guess it's a personal preference that looks about right and I'm just going to add in a couple ice cubes that's going to help keep it cool and we can set this aside while our oil heats up waiting for our oil to heat up to 330 so I'll let you guys know when that happens okay so you just sit tight so our oil is hot at about 3:30 and our potatoes are dry so we can go ahead and do the first frying and this first time we're just trying to cook the potatoes we're not really trying to brown them so we're just going to put in the potatoes and let them cook for about two minutes or until like the all the sizzling subsides a little bit and don't overload it too much just because you don't want to drop the temperature so maybe handful Oh potatoes at a time not that you could use your hands to put things in boiling oil a couple minutes later you can see our oil for the potatoes is not quite as furiously boiling as it was when we first dropped them in and the potatoes are soft they're a little getting a little brown but this isn't the crisping step yet so we're just going to let them drain here and then turn the oil back up to let it get up to like 365 or so and then we'll do the fish in the second fry of the potatoes oils hot up to 365 I've got some fish that I cut just a little bit bigger than the potato pieces I'm using a barramundi which is an Australian fish that I am new to but somebody recommended it on Instagram so thanks bud I really like it but you can use anything dogfish is very traditional but Cod is also good when I was in New Zealand the fish shop would have like five or six different types every day that just whatever was in fresh and you can take your pick so just dip your little fish I'm gonna use my fingers do as I say not as I do don't use your fingers danger and again you don't overload it so just fry a couple pieces at a time and these will be ready when the fish kind of starts to float and the breading is nice and brown and again kind of waiting for that oil sizzle to subside okay so the sizzling has subsided and they're nice and brown strain them a little bit there then these are so so hot I'm going to let them cool for here just a minute while I do the second fry on these potatoes and it'll be fine like the fish will still be plenty hot by the time these potatoes are done just let them go for about a minute until they look really nice and brown and oil again is up to about 365 and the potatoes are done super brown and crisp so excited about those two guys way more excited than I should be for health purposes all right and then while everything's still hot we want to sprinkle it with a little more salt you can also use the same batter the fish better to do like fried mushrooms or zucchini slices even done eggplant chunks it's all delightful all right now usually these are served with malt vinegar but my skanky old grocery store doesn't carry it so I've got some tartar sauce that I made up with some homemade aioli I'll put the recipe and a link to that and then the aioli will be up next Thursday or this coming Thursday or whatever sometime in the future and I'm going to do a little bit of a lemon squeeze though so crispy oh my god can you hear that that crunch oh my god I'm so excited mmm oh my god so crunchy and so moist and just perfectly cooked wow this is better than any fish and chips that you will ever buy in a
