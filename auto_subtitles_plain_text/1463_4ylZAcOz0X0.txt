 hey everyone Chef Jason Hill here and tonight I am going to prepare an udon noodle dish and I've got about three packs it's almost a pound of prepared oonagh noodles so let's get started okay I'm going to go ahead and soak bouton noodles in warm water and falou before we prepare these alright I'm going to keep this recipe vegetarian so I'm going to use a pound of firm tofu you can use extra firm so we're gonna want to cut this into bite-sized pieces pizzas pieces right down the middle down the middle the top I'm just going to cube it up you can buy this already cubed up but how lazy is that okay here we go tofu good stuff good for you now we're going to take my pan preheated on medium-high I don't have a wok I don't know what happened to my wok I need to get a new one so it's a tablespoon and a half of canola followed by about a half a teaspoon of some sesame oil coat the pan the oil around then we're just going to drop in the tofu pieces when you get those brown on at least two sides and this takes a little while for the tofu to Brown when I just used a little screen so the oil doesn't pop all over my kitchen okay while the tofu is cooking away we are going to get the rest of our ingredients together I have six green onion here for garnish two tablespoons of soy sauce tablespoon of rice vinegar two teaspoons of sugar a heaping teaspoon of my garlic shallot puree or you could use about two tablespoons of just regular sliced garlic and then two tablespoons of fresh grated ginger all that smells good okay for the onion I cut them in about one-inch sections on the bias look after soaking for about 10 minutes the noodles are starting to break apart try to do this gently you don't want to shred them just wanted to pull apart just kind of come apart like that no okay like I said I'm going to turn them Brown them on at least two sides there we go look at that that's good this is probably about the longest part of the recipe just turning these little cubes over you don't have to do it individually you can just shake the pan if you want and let them all turn over but on picky so I'm going to do each one alright at this point after about 15 minutes two sides of our tofu or Brown now we're going to drop in our ginger and the garlic shallot puree and we're going to hold man the aroma this is unreal it's only three ingredients we're almost done so now I just slide my pot over here and it's okay to get some of that water in there let's stir our noodles around drop in our green onion put the lid on that's going to sit there for just a couple minutes and we're just going to combine the sugar soy sauce and the rice vinegar stir that up until the sugar completely dissolves now ready to pour this over our mousse give this a really really good stir okay so at this point you can serve it just like this and my wife actually likes boy toys a version of the vom and noodles even though these are Oh Don you can stir in right now some sliced American cheese top it with a poached egg but we're just going to add broth to this and you can do a veggie broth mushroom broth chicken broth even beef broth and today I'm doing chicken broth all right I have four cups of organic chicken broth I'm just going to pour that in there bring it to a boil okay see it's starting to simmer coming to a boil at this point I like to give it a little taste mmm ooh perfect just needs a pinch of salt from the heavens give me a little two pinches and stir that in and that's it super easy super delicious all right there you have it a simple dude on tofu soup let's give it a try get some noodles hmm hmm piece of tofu green onion oh man very good thanks for tuning in for more simple and delicious recipes click on these links and please don't forget to Like share and subscribe
