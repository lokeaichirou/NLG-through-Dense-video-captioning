 hey what's up guys welcome to my kitchen my name is Ryan and I'm a recent college grad and I thought that I would share with you how I make my deluxe version of ramen because if you're in college or even after college you know that their main diet is pretty much ramen so I thought that I would show you a really quick and easy cheap way to make ramen tastes really good so first I need to go and get my ingredients so let's go to the Asian market let's go alright I could just buy ramen and I'll be done let's find the ingredients for when Robin first thing I like to get is the creams or in special sauce but you can use any vegetables but I like to use B bok choy there is the green I don't need that video so maybe that's what's good beats bok choy ah the ramen selection yes I like to buy these because it comes with the broth wandering together and it tastes better to get these ones that like have frozen noodles or already made noodles on the dried one these are always so much better I'm gonna show you Robin and the time comes Robin see these dry ones just aren't as good as the ones are in the freezer here so I would avoid those next you want to get the meat I like to get like pork belly or smoked pork loin so that meat that I guess I'll get this wife it's that simple okay so let's get started on our meal person to do is just get the pot of water boiling started and the trick is you don't actually need to fill the whole pot up with water if you notice if you have the pump with the pot always boiling over when you cook ramen you don't actually need too much water to boil ramen so there you go I'm gonna put it set it to like medium just wait for that to boil while we wait for that to boil I'm going to start on slicing up the green to make this bag so difficult to open the first thing I like to do is wash the greens I'm just going to use two step two of these like this take them apart and then wash them individually that's how you watch it just turn off the water take each piece and run it into the water and wipe your fingers over okay next we take our knife and chop up the baby bok choy into tiny bite-size pieces check it out the first thing I like to do is chop off the ends like to make it diagonal and that's what I do time for the sped up version try it on the front panel so set that to medium also we need some olive oil yeah we're just gonna let the pan heat up and then just stick that on there so what comes in these robin packs it's like way too small one serving is weight useless I always just make two yes that comes with the noodles that are all really nice and it comes with the the soup base here so as you can see the noodles are all really nice and soft and super delicious BAM just cut up the roasted pork belly so I'm just gonna freeze each piece in the neck and it's already cooked so I usually just stick it in the hot broth in the den like keeps it up this will make one two three four five six seven eight problems this is not considered boiling I think this is ready though I can start making with a soup base so what I like to do is I don't like to use the same water that's easier to boil the soup base because the noodles have like flour and stuff on them so what I like to do is boil separate broth so I can get a nice clear broth I have this thing here where I can boil water but you can always as well in another pot I put the rest in the refrigerator here the wire looks like it's ready so noodles okay so this is important right now is to make sure that you keep mixing it or else you don't want the girls to stick to the bottom so the Broncos will be a little package here and you just open the packet and it adds a broth this is soy sauce broth then you add your hot water yeah that's about enough see if the noodles are done perfect so next thing we do is strain the noodles pour cold water over it so this stops the cooking process over here and it also gets rid of all the slime that's on the noodles if there's any extras like Slimer scum so your noodle very extra clean the water drain out and add the noodle to soup base yeah now we're gonna garnish it with everything that we made BAM and it's done awesome the last thing is I add this shichimi pepper for taste to make it extra spicy and there you go yeah awesome look at this ramen so delicious and it's so easy to make and definitely looks better than your average college run in there upgrade let me upgrade ya make sure to check out my main channel vlog after college I'll put a link description below and I've been enjoying my ramen thanks for watching first of all what you need you need an ironing board I would suggest getting like the full size one I used to try to do it on [Music]
