 my husband has a potluck tomorrow and I made this Italian pasta salad and it's really easy and it's one you can do the night before he just sprung it on me I've cooked off a pound and a half of the rotini and I've cut up some vegetables this is one of those English cucumbers half of an orange bell pepper yellow bell pepper I just had them in the fridge a little pint of the grape tomatoes over here I have some asparagus a couple little handfuls of the snow peas a couple handfuls of green beans that I blanched and put in ice water bath show you how I did that I'm blanching some vegetables and some boiling water just for like a minute or so then I place them in a ice water bath to cool down and to set the color look at how vibrant the colors are I've already done some green beans asparagus and some snow peas the snow peas I only put in for maybe like 10 seconds 15 seconds anyway I'm going to finish up this broccoli and get back to making this salad I have some artichoke hearts a little bit of pimentos that are left over from making pimento cheese I'm going to put another little jar in there to just a little bit of red onion not too much a can of black olives the small ones drained just a little bit of broccoli i blanched it and a couple small zucchinis that i blanched I have 8 ounces of salami 8 ounces of pepperoni sliced and 8 ounces of mozzarella cheese I'm going to get this in my bowl I got the salad pretty well mixed and you can use whatever vegetables you have that's the beauty of this I'm going to add 3 and 3/4 ounce of salad toppings I've seen them listed as salad Supremes it's just a got a whole bunch of nuts and bacon bits and all that kind of stuff in it let me add that whole container and then I'm going to add 16 ounces of an Italian dressing I'm going to add the whole bottle I'm going to add this and then get it mixed again the beauty of this salad is you can make it a day before like if you have a potluck we have a picnic you're going to or something like that barbecue and you can use whatever vegetables are in season whatever you have in the fridge it's really one that a lot of people like and it just gets better as it sits needs a little salt and pepper other than that's pretty good so that's my version of an Italian pasta salad
