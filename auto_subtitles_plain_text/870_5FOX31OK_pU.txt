 hi everyone my name is Lila and welcome to my kitchen today I'm making California rolls which are usually filled with a mixture of crab cucumber and avocado but instead of the cucumber and avocado I'll be using celery since my husband doesn't like the others and he just loves the crunch of the salary now to wrap the rolls I'm gonna be using these small sheets of seaweed also called nori you can usually find these in most Asian markets here I'm using the hand roll size I'll also be using sushi rice click the link above to learn how to make this type of rice and for the filling some sliced imitation crab meat and sliced celery I'm using about five sticks of each which I've just cut in half this makes about four to five rolls now you'll need a sushi mat to wrap these rolls and I've just covered mine in plastic wrap so that it's easier to clean between each roll now to start I'm gonna place a sheet of seaweed on the mat then I'm gonna dump my hands in a bowl of salt water this makes the sticky rice not stick to your hands I usually dunk them each time before picking up more rice then I'm gonna spread an even layer of rice on the sheet of seaweed now the key here is to keep your hands watered otherwise when you press the grains they may split and break which we don't want you want a nice thin layer now once you have your rice on carefully flip it over then place the crab and the celery a little bit towards your end and using the mat carefully roll it up making sure that it's tight and you press as you roll and there you have your sushi roll now I just want to place it on a plate and cut it into slices now to do this I'm just gonna dip my knife in a cup of salt water and each time I cut a slice I'm gonna dip my knife again so that the knife doesn't stick to the sticky rice I'm also gonna dip my fingers in the salt water so that they don't stick either once it's cut you can place it on the plate and serve enjoy now you can also make this inside out by not flipping over the seaweed once you put the rice down you just put your crab and celery in the center and then roll it up and there you have your inside out California roll enjoy for complete ingredients and instructions click the link below thank you for watching
