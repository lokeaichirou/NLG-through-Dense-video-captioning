 hey I'm Willie man I'm John and we're the hosts of grow cookies and if you were with us last season you should know that we've moved our garden from Seattle down to Portland we still have our chickens and we'll still be talking about how to grow food and cook in the kitchen so today we're going to talk about bok choy which looks like it would be hard to grow but it's actually really easy and if I recall it's not that hard to cook no it cooks up super fast and we're going to show you how to make it on soup push bok choy it only takes about 15 minutes I'm gonna plant some bok choy by seed you can also grow them by starts but seeds are less expensive and it grows really well and quickly from seed when you're working with small seeds not only do you want to have soil that's finally worked but you also want to make sure that you're not going to cover them up too much with soil and then I'm gonna take a pinch of the seed and just try and sew it in a row spacing the seeds as evenly as I can you know aiming for about an inch apart it's a good idea with really small seed and this works well with basil seed carrot seed and you see that small water it in with a stream from a watering can not from your hose hoses have too strong of a stream of water and they'll wash your seeds away now you can cover them up with garden soil but I like to use some potting soil because it's lightweight I know that it's weed free and it's a slightly different color from my garden soil so it makes it easy for me to remember where I've sown seed then I go through and tap the soil with my hand and that's just so there's good soil to seed contact which is important for germination and then you go back over with the water one more time just to make sure that it's all watered in so I have some pocket way that I grew from starts growing underneath what's called a hoop house and the hoop house is basically a really simple greenhouse so underneath here I have some broccoli growing some radishes and then these purple purple bok choy you just want to take a sharp knife and slide it just under the soil line and sever the plant from its roots so it's real simple people I've got the hoop house all covered back up so I'm gonna head inside and make dinner we make it on soup a lot during the week cuz it's really fast and easy so I've got four cups of broth here and you can use chicken broth or vegetable broth and I'm just going to bring it up to a boil and once they bring it up to a boil I'll add in the noodles and you can just get it on noodles at the grocery store they sell them frozen or they're in the refrigerator case two about two tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and I've heated it up over medium-high heat and I'm gonna put two chopped garlic cloves into the olive oil and just give them a little stir and let them saute until their fragrance and then I'm gonna add in the peppers so that's the greens they have still a little bit of water clinging to their leaves and that's nice it just helps them wilt a little bit of oil once the greens have wilted down to kind of your desired consistency you can just turn off the heat and set them aside until the rest of the soups ready I'm just gonna divide the greens between the two bowls put the noodles between the bowls too so I'm just gonna scoop out about half the noodles and some broth okay we're ready to eat well moment of truth okay what do you think no holds barred feedback yeah oh I see er than I thought it'd be those flippers are kind of hot spicy I know five here than I thought maybe just give me a minute okay we've got a Facebook page now and so in addition to the videos will be posting recipes and I'm gonna put a lot of gardening tips up to throughout the whole season and we are paying attention to your comments so we appreciate them and keep them coming
