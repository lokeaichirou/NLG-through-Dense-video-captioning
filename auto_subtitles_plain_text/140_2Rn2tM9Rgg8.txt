 [Music] now we're off to Thailand to visit with our good friend on achai he's the head chef at the Royal Thai Air Force officers club of man he's worked in some of the finest restaurants in Thailand Japan and Hong Kong so what do we need to first get started today today we're going to make a lot I'm not a young cub first of all let me give you a few of the ingredients I will M phone the way we start with fresh or dry rice noodles chicken eggs cool fresh shrimp or you can use dried shrimp without toasted peanuts that have been crushed they preserve turnips chopped up legato extra firm tofu have dice towel a cup chopped garlic and chopped red onions followed by bean sprout and garlic chives or green onions I got me peep on ground dried roasted chili peppers I'm a doctor and one important ingredient that you can't do with that love styles and we're going to make the sauce out of fish sauce coconut palm sugar like innoncent and tamarind sauce we're gonna make the sauce first that's right first we're gonna make the sauce I'm going to show you what ingredients go into the sauce and so let's begin for the sauce you don't need too much just kind of use medium heat like month on you need a special pan for this or is it just any any kind of pan you can use any kind of pan for this up in New Year's Aloha first we're going to add the camera saw how much tamarind sauce to you the tamarind sauce will we'll be using about 1 cup after that we're going to put in fish sauce about 1 cup of fish sauce and then we're going to add the coconut palm sugar about 2 tablespoons of that oh this looks like it's gonna make a nest food for 4 people actually if you use the amounts I'm using in this recipe you're going to be able to make enough for 10 serving a guy and that's big servings what we're going to do is to make a lot more sauce in the lead today and then we're going to just keep it but what we don't use in the refrigerator we can use it again the next time we make but top off for me oh how long do you leave that boiling for well okay I'm going to stir it until the sugar starts to melt and then I'll let it simmer baby I'm alive what about five minutes or so Aman Hana eat about and then we'll be ready to use about two Alma pin it should come out looking like this sauce right here okay so now we're going to move on to the frying stage find a pie the first thing you want to do is set your pan or your wok over the stove and turn the fire up to kind of a medium-high heat I'd say once the pan is hot go ahead and add some oil how much oil are you putting in about three tablespoons of oil trance the walnut hub for Munich up a ladder for next we'll add some chopped red onions and chopped garlic about one tablespoon of each will do go home then stop young Letran a cup a man 1/4 a cup next we'll add the diced tofu let's put it all in here we'll make about four servings now how much of this tofu do you you tofu I'd say about one piece and is that about yeah one piece about two cups now is this the typical kind of tofu that you find at the store is this a different kind actually I can use any kind of tofu just make sure it's the extra firm tofu on next we're gonna have the chopper turnips how many spoonfuls of chopped turnips are you gonna would say about four teaspoon up then you want to start stirring it to keep stirring just for a little bit you know until it starts to smell good before you have maybe bellow 30 seconds or so couldn't let you die I'd say about how now if you're in Thailand and you're gonna add dried shrimp recipes so let's go ahead and move on and some dried shrimp gonna put about three tablespoons of dried shrimp you don't see that shirt too often at the store can you use some other kind of sir oh sure if you don't have dried shrimp you can always use fresh shrimp or frozen shrimp from the supermarket I can have I can give it's frozen and make sure that thought at first how many what about it I like to use both if it's the fresh shrimp and you need to take the head off you just grab the shrimp like this and and just separate the head from the body tight like to cook shrimp with the head on up that's right ties really like to cook shrimp with the head still on okay now we're going to kind of stir it for a little bit just left the shrimp I can get it go cook let me turn the fire now a little here well if you're going to make four servings like I'm doing here you probably want to have four big shrimp but if you're going to use little v and maybe tender and on we're using fresh water trim here but if you don't want to have a freshwater shrimp you can use any kind of shrimp all the smallest size that's right that's right any kind of shrimp okay when this is done we're going to add some of this over here fresh noodles now the amount of noodles fresh noodles that I'm adding for this recipe is about a pound and the noodles are wet because you've soaked them before here in Thailand we use fresh noodles and that's why they're soft if you're using the dried packaged noodles you're going to have to soak them in water so that they get a little soft before you before you stir-fry them okay now I'm going to add a little bit of water here to soften up the noodles even little more okay now we're going to stir this up a little bit until the noodles get nice and soft you'll probably find that the ingredients that we use here in Thailand and the ones you'll find in the West aren't exactly the same but that's okay this is how we do it in Thailand are you cooking this for two three minutes about half a minute if you use the fresh noodles now if you use the the dry noodles you're going to have to cook them longer maybe two or three minutes just cook them until they're soft I'm going to add a little more oil here if you see the noodles not too dry that's right and then I'm gonna add some Amy for this recipe I'm gonna add about three eggs just like that yep add the eggs right in there it's important that you have a real hot wok when you stir fry put tied to get the real flavor to come out okay now after you've added the eggs in you'll want to add the sauce that we made earlier you know for this recipe I'm going to use about 6 tablespoons of sauce and enough for fall people attract four people now once we've added the sauce we can add this the beans routes along it up it's all good and then I'll add the chives so about a cup of golly shy that's right about a cup of way of chives and a cup of bean sprouts ya know if you want it spicy you're gonna want to add some of this dry roasted ground peppers in there I'm gonna make it not too spicy so I'm just going to add a little bit what about the people who don't like spicy oh yeah we don't like spicy you don't have to add it at all it'll be fine so it depends on the individual here right now if you're not sure if your guests like it's spicy or not spicy you can also put the ground peppers on the side of the dish and they can add it in themselves okay now it's done and this is gonna be enough for about four or five good service will dish it out wow that room is mine in Thailand Pattaya is usually served with fresh vegetables because Thais love fresh vegetables we'll start with hubli what's hopefully it's the flower of the banana plant then we'll add some bean sprouts we'll put them over here to the side next we'll add some Thai herbs with some green onions Hawkeye yeah I'd be ignoring it and if you like that lemony flavor you can squeeze some limes over in America we don't have all these vegetables so we'll just use green lettuce leaves instead you can use lettuce you can use any kind of vegetables use your imagination any coyopa mischievous that's right any kind of fresh vegetables you want to use
