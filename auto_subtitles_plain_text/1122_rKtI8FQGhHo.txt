 Allrecipes member Marian comments this is an easy vegan friendly falafel made using dried garbanzo beans and ingredients you already have in your cupboard no eggs or breadcrumbs either as filler just tasty falafel it's not much more work than using canned beans but the taste is phenomenal and authentic start by rinsing 1 pound of dried garbanzo beans thoroughly under cold running water discard any discolored or bad beans and carefully remove any debris once the beans are clean cover them with cold water and allow the beans to soak overnight keep an eye on them because you'll probably have to add water several times during the soaking process the next day begin by prepping the other ingredients start by quartering one onion then peel and quarter one potato mince four cloves of garlic squeeze two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice now rinse the soaked garbanzo beans with fresh water and drain them place the garbanzo beans into the bowl of a food processor add the onion and the potato you cover the bowl and process this mixture until it's finely chopped pour the bean mixture into a mixing bowl leaving about one cup of it in the processor bowl add the garlic to the processor bowl half a cup of cilantro leaves one teaspoon of ground coriander and one teaspoon of ground cumin add in two teaspoons of salt a half of a teaspoon of ground black pepper and a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper process this mixture to blend it thoroughly once the mixture is blended add the reserved garbanzo bean mixture back into the processor bowl add in the lemon juice along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour process the falafel until the mixture resembles a coarse meal transfer the falafel mix back to the mixing bowl cover and refrigerate it for at least two hours when you're ready to cook the falafel add 2 teaspoons of baking soda into the mixture and stir until the baking soda is well blended dampen your hands and form the falafel dough into balls making each ball about one-and-a-half inches in diameter place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet when all the dough is formed pour enough canola oil into a deep pot or skillet to be 1 to 2 inches deep heat the oil over medium-high heat to 365 degrees cook the falafels in batches four or five at a time turning them frequently so they turn uniformly golden-brown about 5 minutes for each batch when the falafels are done drain them on paper towel serve the falafels hot Allrecipes member Marian so jess --tz-- that you serve your falafel with typical falafel fare such as lettuce tomato cucumber and a squeeze of lemon
