 frog hard to canal that's duck not goose and I just bought four hundred and fifty six grams of good old frog ha 416 42 euros now that's a deal and that's when the reasons why I live in the South France because I can buy a whole frog for 16:42 now that's a great deal on my sakes good cognac 11 euros goddamn champagne 3 euros the unifor work I'm going to show you how to pan fry foie gras which is one of my favourite recipes that my cousin taught me 25 years ago you know some people may think that I'm just gonna be butchering this flood laughs but you can take it or leave it and tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take first I'm just going to get the oil off nice and hard for making my french fries so now the French fries are frying I wait till the French fries are basically corrupt cut this and I fry this because this literally takes only about 30 to 30 seconds to 1 minute this is raw by the way so nice piece of liver the back end there's not too many blemishes there's a little bit of these blood things but that's nothing at all all the veins are already out pull the fries out they're brown now I'll just like this I'll turn the heat down so that the oil doesn't heat up too much no a couple of pieces here this is really it really is like butter YUM it's so rich now this is already ample meal for two people but since it's my birthday we're going to cut a little more now I'm not going to taste it because it is raw after all it hasn't been cooked like this is really living in the lap of luxury so abusive the ultimate and decadence tan is throwing up it should be fun so I'm going to put just a little bit of oil there's tons of oil and fat in the front dog but just so that the meat the protein and the meat doesn't crisp up I'll just put a little bit of oil there and I'm just going to let it heat up very small about a while just put a little piece there just to test it out it's already pretty good I'm going to put just a little bit more oil tying a little bit you know thirty Seconds to Flora just before I put the front line there we're going to recut the fries in here just to give them that little extra heat they've been dripping they seized up they're crispy they're just giving that little extra brown do that for one two minutes let this pan heat up nicely okay so the fries are done I turn off the fryer and I pull these guys out and I let them drip for a couple of minutes because I see now in the pan here is too much oils too much see all that it's just got to be a skim coat because the photo has a lot of fat in there already but ten is well lubricated and so I'm just going to get rid the excess oil in your care I'm going to put a little bit of salt in the frying pan just like this okay I take my liver right foot over very delicate leaves a steak with french fries they're ready to go so here's what I saw  big-time comes the two pairs of big-time comes the two pairs of you little hotter they're really quick cookin okay so the quad ride is now ready now I don't the is I'm going to put a very small amount of Chania on the foie gras itself you watch this ok just a very small amount that's it I think it's going to be perfect ok let's go eat we got the pepper and the Fergana off to the fireplace to try my little birthday Cheers better pepper fries a bit on the flood clock we've got some pumpernickel bread which is good with the football yeah see perfect consistency is perfect that's nasty man how old are you Krista I'm 54 cool looking good feeling good yeah baby girl no for sure now it's my turn yeah this is really nice wood this bread you've got a secret stuff that this bread works the best here no so I was so thick fast and furious that we couldn't even eat the small portions that we did gave ourselves see my wife Linda she left half a foot long I'm finished everything but it's so rich and just massive that um full so I think I'm just going to relax now that was a lot of why are they holy Jesus Christ
