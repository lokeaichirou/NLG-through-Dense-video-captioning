 hi everyone I'm gonna read and welcome to my kitchen and today we're going to be making some brunch and we're gonna be making something a little unconventional we're gonna be doing croque madame and croque monsieur and if you don't know what that is that's just a fancy French Way of saying grilled ham and cheese and grilled ham and cheese with a fried egg on top so let's get started okay let's build our croque monsieur and the cook Monsieur is the one it's just supreme grilled ham and cheese I have some really nice French bread because French bread was the good bakery bread which I can never seem to resist was on special this week and my harris-teeter buy one get one free so when that happens and it's still hot out and it's summertime guess what marine buys her bread she doesn't always bake her bread why am I talking about myself in the third person I don't know and I'm using soft butter from my butter belt and if you don't have a butter belt I highly recommend that you get one it's Jean it is it's really genius you know you put a little water in the base you put the butter in the bell you keep it on your counter and and the butter stays soft all the time so now I'm I flipped over my bread because I want the butter on the outside and I'm gonna layer a couple of slices of Muenster cheese here and you can use Swiss you can use cheddar you can use whatever kind of cheese you want because this is your sandwich we have Munster this week because that's what was on special at the deli and then I'm gonna go ahead whoops I forgot I like to make sure that I have cheese on both sides of the meat but only one piece because three pieces is plenty and that will help this sandwich stick together when you're grilling it and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to spread on a little butter on this other side of the bread okay and I'm gonna make another just gonna lay our sandwiches down I preheated that griddle at about 300 degrees and I have also because we're going to make the croque madame um I have oiled up a couple of my english muffin rings and I'm gonna put them dill side down on the griddle I've boiled the insides so that they don't stick and I have my spatula and because this griddle has been preheated these are not gonna take very long to start melting and cooking and getting really nice and delicious so what we're gonna do is we're gonna allow these to cook and then when we come back we'll flip them and then I'll drop my eggs and then I'll show you what that looks like we're gonna go in I flipped this one already like I said if you have a preheated griddle it's not gonna take very long at all and then I always find that I have to readjust after I flip so we're just gonna put these over here and let them do their melty thing and then I'm going to move my rings give a little spray in there going may or may not help I find that it is a bit helpful it sees in these eggs with a little herb de Provence and I'm not going to break the yolk because Rick and I both like our eggs over-medium and now I'm gonna see if this is gonna let me almost it's hot let's see I can use this yeah if you have to you can just loosen around the edge of the egg of course you don't have to put your egg in an egg mold unless you really want to let's see if this works and my husband once again was right billion know if you only get one solid state yep there's no denying it and of course you cook your egg anyway you like it you don't have to make it over medium you can make it Sunnyside up if you like and I broke my egg see no worries just keep it all together not a big deal is still gonna taste great and if you mash it up like that for your guests nobody is ever going to know that it wasn't supposed to be that way simple we can give these another flip these are gorgeous look at that beautiful okay so now we're gonna get ready to fix you a plate of croque madame and croque monsieur because i know you're hungry okay here you go I fixed your plate what do you prefer croque monsieur or crook my dad with egg or without egg it's just a fancy fancy French way of saying grilled ham and cheese with or without an egg so you make that choice
