 so what we're making today is a crispy baked Parmesan chicken with roasted Brussels sprouts with some dried cranberries and freshly grated Parmesan cheese the whole recipe is about 300 calories including the side dish whereas a major chain restaurant has chicken parmesan for about 1100 calories because usually when you make chicken parmesan it's fried in oil and it's smothered with fatty cheese and it's served with a side of spaghetti whereas here we're gonna make a crispy coating and bake it with a light coating of flavorful cheese just enough to make it still taste decadent so one of the great things about this meal is the whole thing can be prepared to start to finish in 30 minutes or less so what we're gonna do is we're gonna get our Brussels sprouts roasting first and then we're gonna prep the chicken and then everything will come out at the same time hot and delicious so the first thing we're gonna do is I've some Brussels sprouts they're just have here but if you have small ones you don't even need to do that and I'm gonna toss them with about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil I like to do with my hands because then they can really get coated and then just a little bit of kosher salt sprinkled on there I'm gonna get these in the oven so what I have are some thinly pounded chicken breasts here you can use chicken cutlets and I have whole wheat flour but you can use whatever kind of flour you like but you really won't notice a difference if you use whole wheat and you get the extra benefits of the whole grain so we dip it in the flour first and coat it and then dip it in some egg get it nice and coated but then let that extra egg drip off what I really like is how crispy the coating gets almost like a fried chicken or a fried egg fried chicken parmesan and then we dip it in panko which is a nice light crispy kind of breadcrumbs you can even find whole-wheat panko sometimes so if you like those use those and we're gonna bake these first so now I'm gonna get these in the oven so they're gonna be baking with with the Brussels sprout so they're gonna bake for just about six minutes at high heat I'm gonna take them out and we'll finish the recipe so what we're gonna do now is put on actually I'm gonna put in a little bit of pesto this is optional but we love the flavor of pesto so I'm just gonna spread about a teaspoon full of pesto on each breast each chicken cutlet and then do about a tablespoon of sauce this is a fresh tomato sauce that I got at the farmers market but whatever tomato sauce your family likes and then we take some of these fresh herbs I have chopped up basil and sage here and again you can use dried herbs but I really love the flavor of these fresh garden herbs which actually came out of my garden and some of the cheese and this is part skim mozzarella and Parmesan combined together and you can see we have plenty of cheese here so it's still gonna taste rich and decadent I'm gonna put these back in the oven for six to eight minutes until it's all melted and the chicken looks nice and browned and then the Brussels sprouts will be ready at the same time ready to go and so what I'm gonna do simplest thing I'm just gonna take these naturally sweetened dried cranberries sprinkle them on there and then I'm gonna take a little bit of you can either buy grated Parmesan cheese or this is kind of fun also a fun thing for kids to do if they're around just grate a little bit like maybe a teaspoon then I'm just gonna toss it all together a little bit get the flavors in there those are ready to go and so delicious these Brussels sprouts turn my Brussels sprouts the testing family into Brussels sprouts lovers mmm it's actually better than the Italian restaurant that you're gonna take their family out to light crispy delicious and still decadent tasting
