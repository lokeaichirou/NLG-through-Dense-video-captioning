 howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen you are looking gorgeous yes you are today we are making a BLT a BLT fit for mr. t you crazy fool quiz sucker make it look less so make this good times it looks amazing right and this recipe request comes from me I really wanted to make a BLT about four years ago before I really started getting into cooking and stuff used to hate tomatoes and I used to hate less but the more I've used them in recipe videos the more I've grown to like BLTs and everyone likes bacon right and I was thinking dice cannot look put a special twist on it rather than being a BLT so I add some avocado but then it'd be like a BL a t like a blat now just stick to the BLT you wanna have a go at making this hit pause on the video now write all these ingredients down super simple you must you must you must try this please please Thanks we'll start off by making a sexy lemon pepper mustard mayo so in a bowl combine your mayonnaise with the Dijon mustard around about half the amount of your mayonnaise but you can tweak that to your liking scrape on some lemon zest scrape on I mean like zest on some lemon zest with like a zester you know I'm saying and grind on some pepper and give it a good mix through until fully combined then whack it in the fridge for the time being in terms of the lettuce and the tomato all I did was grab yourself a knife shredded up the less and just cut my tomatoes into nice thick chunky slices so easy right now we've got bacon I wanted to get it nice and crispy so I worked mine under the grill for a good eight to ten minutes turning it over but there's nothing to stop you cooking it in a pan or even oven baking it if you want whatever you want to do and once it's done just cut it into nice little strips oh yeah baby now the reason I really wanted to do this recipe video today was I was on a training of the day and paid five pounds for a BLT and the bread was terrible it was so thin like I could wash my face with it there was hardly any lettuce there was like one little sliver of bacon I don't even think it was a tomato actually in there it might have been a piece of orange I don't really know but the really thing that's going to make this recipe your own is getting some good quality bread this is from my baker it's a seeded Grammy loaf so so good and of course we always in Greece we made we can stack them high so taste up your bread slice toast toast it up and now we build it yet we build it by grabbing a slice of our toasted bread grabbing some of that mayonnaise and spreading it all over which will act as our glue piling on our lettuce nice and high so really good a ton on that plonk on some tomato slices your King strips a little drizzle more of mayonnaise and some more lettuce if you want to and then simply top it that is looking mr. t quizzes sucker sensational I'll just say guys if it's cooled down and you want it a little warmer wrap it in some baking parchment like this and shove it in the oven for around about five minutes and it'll be good baby oh yeah oh my goodness I don't know who invented it BLT but I'm in love with him right now it's so fresh and particularly that mayonnaise is working its way through it the BLT combo never felt it well if four years ago it did to me but I'm loving it right now and it goes great with a book and some of you have been messaging me saying Barry I ordered your book can you sign it for me yes get in touch by my website it's a lot easier for me to reply to you that way and I will sign it for you but guys if you try out this BLT send me a picture @myvirginkitchen let me know what sort of spin you put on your BLT down below and if you enjoyed this video don't forget your best dance up share subscribe and comment all that stuff and no buy my book if you are not ready love you guys see you next time
