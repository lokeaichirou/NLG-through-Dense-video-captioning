 Matar paneer samosa hi welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana I'm shy and let's make a simple snack today let's make mutter paneer samosa now we'll go through the ingredients of this recipe to make mutter and paneer samosa we would require some green peas cottage cheese or paneer coriander leaves salt ginger refined flour or mega green chillies cumin seeds red chilli powder chaat masala garam masala powder some ready-made samosa strips oil for deep frying to begin with we'll prepare of stuffing or a filling for the samosa for that I have taken a mixer jar in which we'll put the green peas these are boiled green peas let's add some chillies chopped chillies some ginger cumin seeds or jeera some fresh coriander leaves and some salt and now we'll grind this mixture to a coarse paste don't want a very fine paste I think that is perfectly fine let's take it out in a big bowl so I have a bowl over here so let's take out the prepared mixture in a bowl so this will add the cottage cheese or the paneer and some powdered spices like red chilli powder chaat masala and garam masala powder give it a mix so as you can see a stuffing is now ready we'll keep it aside and now we'll prepare a paste we'll prepare the paste of refined flour we'll add some water to it this is basically to seal the samosa parties that you are going to fry there are little bit water and make it into a thick paste mix it well if you feel that the water is less you can certainly add some more water but I think not require any more water this is a perfect thick paste that is how we want it keep this also side now I have some ready-made some our strips over here these are readily available in the market they're in the frozen form what you can do is you can get them put them in your freezer and use them as in when require while using take them out of the freezer put it in the refrigerator so that the temperature of the samosa strips will come down and they will be pliable something like this now I have kept these phimosis lips outside for quite a long time that is why I have put a muslin cloth of wet muslin cloth on the samosa steps so that they do not dry okay so your are the samosa strips let's start making the samosas we'll take a samosa strip put it on a chopping board or a surface and will apply the prepared refined flour paste on the sides and spread it nicely this is basically done to allow the strip to stick while we stop the samosa place a portion of the stuffing on one Fred of the samosa and just fold one side over the other see a nice triangle is forming make sure that your edges are sealed at all the times you can see the samosas are nice and ready let's prepare some more samosas in the similar way so we have prepared some samosas and I've also heated some oil in a kadai let's fry them fry them till they are nice and golden brown in colour make sure that the temperature of the oil is not too high neither it is too low if the temperature of the oil is too low the samosa parties will absorb much oil and they will turn soggy and if the temperature is too high the samosa strips will all born from the outside so just to maintain the temperature of the oil okay you can see the samosas after a nice and golden round let's take them out on an absorbent paper so as to get rid of any excess oil from the samosas samosas are ready let's arrange them on a serving platter mutter paneer Musa is ready serve it hot with green chutney or tomato ketchup Oh
