 bangers and mash with Parmesan polenta it sounds good doesn't it this dish is perfect for sunday morning brunch it's quite easy to make we're going to start by cooking the sausages so over low heat now I chose some veal sausages but you can choose any kind that you like I'm going to let the sausages cook for a few minutes in the meantime I can get the polenta ready now in a saucepot I'm going to bring to a boil some low-sodium chicken stock with some sun-dried tomatoes that I've sliced this will add flavor the chicken stock has come to a boil now I can add some cornmeal I chose some fine cornmeal so the polenta cooks faster I'm going to sprinkle it on top this way I won't get any lumps and with a whisk just going to stir quickly again to avoid any lumps just before I continue stirring I'm going to turn the sausages around ah nice golden brown color on one side I'm going to let the sausages cook for a few more minutes and now we're back to the polenta just keep on stirring I'm going to continue stirring the polenta until it's nice thick and creamy the polenta is ready I'm going to turn the heat off and switch tool it'll be easier so I like to finish it off with the wooden spatula now we're going to season with pepper now we can't forget the cheese for this recipe I've chosen Canadian parmesan but you can replace it by Canadian aged cheddar so I'm going to grade it right on top of the polenta I need about 2 ounces the polenta is ready now to serve this dish I like to mix some fresh herbs so I have some chives some parsley and some fresh basil now for the basil I'm just going to slice it thinly this herb mixture will give a nice refreshing flavor to the bangers and mash and so all the herbs can stick together just to touch of olive oil salt and pepper we're going to mix all the herbs together now be ready to assemble the dish I'm going to start by the polenta not too much has a rich flavor with the parmesan one sausage per person and the herb garnish now maybe just a touch of parmesan on top what a perfect dish for brunch Bon Appetit
