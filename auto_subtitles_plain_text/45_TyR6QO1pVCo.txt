 hey that's David no recipe required and tonight I've got a fried rice dish for now I guess turn a right the day before I picked off some pork chops I got a little bit of leftover pork so we're gonna make pork fried rice it's really easy to do and a great way to use leftovers both like meat like the pork I've got or if you've got leftover rice from ordering Chinese food and even all the vegetables in your and your French we'll use them obviously what I've got but feel free to substitute it's really about the technique on this one let's go ahead and get started okay let's go ahead and get started on our pork fried rice now I like to start you should start with the UH with the vegetables that are gonna take the longest and you also want to make sure that you get everything kind of prepared before you start because everything goes pretty quick I got my pan on high heat I have my carrots first cuz they are kind of the most you know thickest medias vegetable that'll take the longest time I'm gonna add my onion and a couple cloves of garlic just kind of course the chops a little bit of vegetable oil in the pan some salt some pepper we're in a season as we go he's gonna take probably three minutes or so just to UM start softening I don't like to cook anything super soft but I've got my pork chopped up we're ready to go leftover pork for me a couple pork chops I've got an egg that I added about two tablespoons of water to mixed up thoroughly I've got my rice precooked cooked it this morning using leftover rice the absolute first and then some frozen peas standing by so I'm going to come back in about two minutes we'll add the ingredients put everything together okay so before the onion or garlic Brown give it a little toss I'm going to add my egg and then I'm gonna roll the pan I like to use a nonstick pan for this recipe roll the pan so it kind of spreads out let the egg go for a couple couple seconds really it doesn't take all that long and then kind of get in there scramble it around and then we'll kind of separate fall apart and we had our the ingredients I'm gonna add my peas I got like a quarter cup of frozen peas gonna add our pork you really want to get the heat going as much as possible just toss all this together we gotta season again as we go a little bit of salt a little bit of fresh ground black pepper then we'll hit it with just a little bit of soy sauce I find the biggest kind of mistake I used to make was adding too much soy sauce to flavor everything and I don't really I find it can be overpowering pretty quick and we're gonna add about two cups maybe three two and a half cups cooked rice if you ever need to add a touch more oil you can do that and then I'm just gonna cook this on high heat the oil we add that all the other ingredients I'm just gonna kind of break up the rice so it doesn't really stick together anymore I know let this go on high heat for probably five minutes four minutes it really does depend on your heat so we're gonna come back taste it for seasoning add any adjustments and we'll be done okay I've been going a few minutes my rice is actually just starting to stick to the bottom which is uh for me it's not we're gonna pull it out you want to give it a little taste make sure your team in is good mine could use just a little bit more salt and pepper give it one more toss and we're good together let's serve this up okay let's go ahead and serve up this beautiful colorful and delicious fried rice you can obviously make this a whole meal in itself or serve it as a side dish it's got plenty of ingredients in there and this is obviously one of those dishes you can really kind of throw anything at all in there you want anything you got in the fridge any leftovers and you're gonna absolutely love it I'll see you next time on no recipe required you
