 [Music] g'day guys thank you for all of your awesome requests I'll be making a number of them in coming episodes but today it's one for AJ Space Jam 11 for some mini burgers now I'm going to start by making the rolls for these you will need 1 tbsp of melted butter 2 tablespoons of beaten egg 120 mils of lukewarm water 240 grams of white flour now use a good strong bread flour for this 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a tbsp of sugar and a teaspoon of dried yeast now to start off just put the yeast and the sugar into that water give it a quick stir together and set it aside in a warm place for half an hour this will get the yeast going and what we're looking for here is that foam on top so it's time to make the rest of our dough so add the salt into the flour followed by the egg the melted butter [Music] the yeast sugar and water mix then combined well and knead it until the dough smooth this will take about ten or so minutes [Music] then cover it in a lightly flour container and leave it in a warm place to rise for about an hour now this is enough dough to make 20 or 25 of these so I'm just using half of it here today of course you can use this mixture to make normal-sized bread rolls too so roll out that dough until it's about 3/4 of a centimeter thick and what I'm doing here is using a melon baller to cut out these mini disks from it they're about an inch or so in diameter then brush with a bit of egg wash and sprinkle over some sesame seeds [Music] now I've got the barbecue setup for indirect cooking 180 degrees Celsius cook with the lid down of course use your oven if you like and these will take 8 to 10 minutes to cook and these are delicious to eat on their own as well so now for the rest of the burger 200 grams of beef mince here I've got some bacon which are cut into squares some cheese slices which are also cut into squares some mini roma tomatoes which are sliced some rocket and some barbecue sauce of course use whichever condiments you like now I'm just giving this beef a light seasoning with some salt and pepper mix it together well and then between two sheets of baking paper gently roll it out until it's about 1/2 centimeter thick and once that's done put it into the freezer for about 20 minutes and this will help it all hold together now to cut out the burgers I'm just using a glass here you can use a small cookie cutter if you like and you want to cut them to a size that's about a centimeter or two larger in diameter then your rolls because these will shrink as you cook them then simply cook the bacon and the burgers on a medium hot barbecue plate [Music] and when they're about half done just place those slices of cheese onto the burgers followed by the squares of bacon and cook it until it melts and now to assemble the burgers so cut one of those mini rolls in half put the burger cheese and bacon on top followed by a bit of that barbecue sauce a cherry tomato a bit of rocket the top button and stick a toothpick through it now repeat this process for all of your mini burgers now serve them to your guests or eat them yourself these are absolutely awesome guys be sure to give them a go drop me a comment below and tell me what is your favorite entertaining finger food check out my other videos and subscribe for regular updates thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time [Music]
