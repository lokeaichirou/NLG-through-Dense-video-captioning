 so you liked my son's show huh some of you want him to replace me I read those comments that was crazy you guys are insane that's it he doesn't get on the show anymore until Halloween at least anyway I love him dearly he did a great job boy was that fettuccine alfredo amazing in fact drummer tutu for already submitted a picture look at this look how beautiful that looks great job I just want to thank Jack jr. for a wonderful job today and we all know that I'm doing kimchi I'm either thinking of doing falafel which is uh kind of a Middle Eastern food or I'm going to do far which is a Vietnamese dish I don't know when that's gonna be my next international show so I'm leaving it up to you guys down below is it falafel or is it far which one of my making you put it down below and we'll see who wins and that'll be my next international show I promise you first thing we're gonna do is prepare the cabbage second thing we're gonna do is make we're gonna prepare our vegetables dice them all up third thing we're gonna do is make the paste I'm doing an easy version some of you may be familiar with leaving the cabbage hole and opening the leaves mine is more of a lazy man's version okay we're gonna cut up the lettuce into bite-sized pieces our first thing we're gonna do is rinse all the cabbage so you're gonna need a big big container a big bowl big pot anything to rinse the cabbage we're gonna rinse it all at water and then drain it all to fill the whole thing with water next thing you want to do is get your salt I keep my kosher salt in this container and we're gonna salt the entire top of it okay like you're seasoning the top this is the process where I guess it's like curing your your cabbage or something I don't know but basically we're going to salt it we're gonna leave it and then in 30 minutes we're going to flip it and salt it again and then flip it and salt it again then we're gonna rinse all the salt out of it so it's an hour and a half process of the cabbage so I'm gonna leave this here and then come back to it in 30 minutes in the meantime we're gonna go over back over to the table and we're gonna start preparing everything else all right now it's time to prepare all the vegetables I like to get those out of the way so that I can just throw them in when it's time okay as you notice I'm cutting these kind of at an angle in kind of a weird shape I'm not cutting them exactly normal so I'm giving you my gun okay here's the here's the Korean radish I just kind of cut this in pieces here so I'm gonna cut this I'm gonna cut this right down the middle and we're gonna cut the just really thin pieces like this okay and then your your onions and your chives are just gonna be in pieces like like that just 1/2 inch pieces and then you're gonna cut the same with the with the chives and we're just gonna we're throwing them right now we're throwing them all in a bowl you may want to leave the prevent the bottom so you can just sit here in makes a lot easier to hold it together first thing we're gonna do to make our pace is create a porridge that's what they call it you're gonna take three cups of water and you're gonna take this sweet rice flour and you're gonna boil these two together okay once those are starting to boil you're gonna throw this in this is the sugar and it's gonna become a little translucent all right here we go put the flour in the water gonna mix it up real well and bring it to a little bit of a boil all right as you can see on the edge hidden the perimeter bubbles are being made yep so we're gonna we're gonna put the put the sugar in now there you go mix that ain't good you're gonna just keep this in there and stir in for a few more minutes then we turn it off and let it cool okay so we've cooked that in for a few minutes we're just gonna put this on the back burner we let this cool for a little bit we're gonna start working on the rest of our paste I'm gonna blend these ingredients these three ingredients I'm gonna put in the food processor and just hit it that's gonna be ginger garlic and onion let's hope I have enough room if not I'll make room it's really easy just put it on hit it and then put the rest stuff in so if you don't have enough room just do what you got and then we'll move on okay and in there nope just go ahead and put in what you got you'll have room in a minute this thing's awesome I really love love my ninja it's powerful you don't to worry about the motor burning out this thing is great if you haven't seen the the ninja video later just click on the link at the end of the video I'll send you over there you can see my review of it ok cabbage has been rinsed off thoroughly it's time to put our paste up together so here we go alright here's our porridge mixture we're gonna put that in first we're gonna have the fish sauce alright now look at this pepper flakes I got the pepper flakes the Asian storage just in case these are a different type of temperature they ask for a lot of pepper flakes this is where you control the heat if you like it spicy follow the recipe you don't like it too spicy then back off on the pepper flakes a little bit and then we've got our onions garlic and ginger mixture we're gonna put that in there just mix this all around keep this all work done oh wow ok these these smells are all coming together it looks crazy unbelievable I can't even explain the garlic and the pepper and the fish sauce it's just battling it out right now alright next thing we're gonna have we're gonna mix in all this stuff into this and beautiful it's all coming together I love this part when you're sort of so fond of it I love this part when you start doing everything together now the last part is this getting this in the air you get your hands dirty still be ready you got kids bring them in they're gonna love this most kimchi is fermented and what that means is almost like we're gonna leave this out and it's going to start bubbling and it's gonna get really sour you're not gonna free it refrigerate this you can't eat it like this you don't like the sour taste this will be amazing the last thing you want to do is you want to place this in a airtight container that's what's gonna for it ferment in there it is I'm gonna leave this on the counter for for 48 hours it's in an airtight container leave it on the counter for a minimum 48 hours you're gonna see when you crack it open and see the snow sour and it's gonna have bubbles created on the surface you'll see it if you don't want to sour your kimchi I choose to just put it right in the fridge but I leave mine on the counter for two days so here's what I'm gonna do I mean I'm gonna try it first to let you know how it is cuz it just smells amazing and some of the red pepper in them it's just it's awesome here we go Wow I could eat this just like this and it's really hot hmm it's good so control the heat I love it like this I love the heat but it's really really good I'm trying over right off the top mmm it was very healthy fresh vegetables a little heat amazing mm-hmm can't wait for 48 hours to be up so here's what's gonna happen you're getting an update video for me on this channel in two days I'm gonna crack this bad boy open and we're gonna try it out all right this was very easy a lot of ingredients try it out it's down below in
