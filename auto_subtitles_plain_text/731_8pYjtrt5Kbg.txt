 hello friends today I'm going to be preparing a crispy leopard calamari and this is one of my favorite recipes for summer monsoons it was totally yummy and very tasty let's look into the ingredients and get started I have taken 250 grams of split since I I'm the only person who eats in the house I am just using 250 grams it's cleaned and cut into rings and have reserved it it's thoroughly washed we also need one small onion or a shallot finely chopped 2 sprigs of curry leaves and ten ports of garlic further masala powder we need a 1 tablespoon of peppercorns half a teaspoon of cumin seeds 1 dried red chillies and 2 sprigs of colonies again we will need add all purpose flour and corn flour as per the requirement you will need to eyeball it and add it to the squid while we are marinating the squid now first and finish one way to do is in your small fry time I've placed it on a very low flame I am just going to go ahead and add the spices and the color leaves and start dry roasting it and when it constantly stir this because if it burns you are going to have a very bitter taste once you prepare the masala powder make sure you keep stirring this on a very low flame once the cumin starts to splatter just pinch it off and add it to a mortar and pestle and just grind it into a coarse powder if you do not have a motor in personal user coffee grinder this will be about one and a half tablespoons of powder so that's about it now to the squid I have thoroughly washed the squid and to the speed I'm going to go ahead and add the all-purpose flour and corn flour now the all-purpose flour you can add about 3 to 4 tablespoons the square needs to be coated thoroughly with the all-purpose flour and the corn flour because if you are going to fry the squid it's going to splatter a lot to know it so make sure the squid is thoroughly coated with the corn flour and E or all-purpose flour I've also added salt and pepper you can leave this for five minutes on your countertop and just check the moisture content and add little bit of extra all-purpose flour if needed now once that is done and just going to go ahead and heat oil and start adding the first squid to it and fry it just for a minute that's about it not more than that you do not say it as I'm doing it in a small fry pan so once the squid is fried nicely for a minute's time I'm just going to remove from the oil and drain the excess oil in the tissue paper now in walk I've added two tablespoons of oil to the nun we'll add the garlic onion and the curry leaves and just going to toss this and fry this till it turns light pink in color now the recipe in detail for this is posted on my blog blog link will be posted only about bad below this video you can also visit me on my Facebook fan page like me then and follow me for regular updates I'll be posting a lot of restaurant reviews on the matter so do visit me on Zomato as well all the links will give me about bye below this video now gone ahead and added the powder that i prepared earlier masala powder and this one it cost this a bit it's needed you can definitely add excess pepper powder while you're tossing the squid now at this point I'm just going to quickly pass this foot because the squid is already fried in its cook if you're going to cook this further it's going to turn into a rubbery mess so make sure you cross this just for a minutes time and that's about it you're going to add some salt as per taste a little bit of for pepper powder just for the flavor that's about it and we'll give this a good touch and serve it up with languages this is an excellent side dish or you can serve this as a starter it's excellent would be off or it's absolutely yummy with any salt Indian meal so both give this recipe a try and post your comments friends if you liked this video give this video a thumbs up and share this with your friends do subscribe for more such videos I will be seeing you soon in the next recipe video and so then thanks for watching bye bye
