 some of you've asked me to make chicken parmesan so this week that's what I'm doing you're gonna need about a couple of pounds of chicken cutlets to beaten eggs and on this plate I have bread crumb panko and Parmesan cheese you can just have bread crumb and Parmesan cheese but I like to add the panko for a little crunch and just mix this up take your cutlet and put it into the egg and then just coat it with your cheese and bread crumb mixture and I like to press it in hard so it sticks really nice fry your cutlet I fried them about three minutes on each side now take your cutlets and put them on some paper towels to bring while you make your next bet after you're done frying them put them on a cookie sheet that's lined either with parchment paper or so so Pat you know I met and or you can just grease it with a spray then you take your modern odd and I have a link my recipe for this sauce it's my basic marinara but an odd marinara and just put some running out on top I don't have to drown it just a little bit is enough then you take slices of mozzarella cheese and just put it on top some of them you might need to I like a lot of cheese on it now you're gonna put it into a 400 or 450 degree oven and you're gonna put it in there for about 10 minutes until the cheese gets nice and bubbly and melting oh it just came out of the oven I'm gonna try it look at that oh you gotta love that cheese look at that that's gorgeous I made some zoodles on the side but you should actually make a better pasta with the sauce and then put the chicken parmesan on top but I'm trying to keep it a little low carb so I did it with zoodles hmm it's so good so good mmm I don't always make this it's such an easy dish and I really really make this but I do love it and I hope you try this don't forget to thumbs up and enjoy for more dinner recipes check out my playlist and don't forget to subscribe I post a new video every Saturday
