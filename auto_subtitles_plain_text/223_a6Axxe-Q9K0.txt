 hi I'm Canuck and you're watching Ready Steady eat today I am going to show you how to make hash rounds hash browns are staple breakfast food in America basically it is a potato preparation which is pan-fried it can be served as a side dish and it goes very well with any kind of meal so without any delay let me tell you what all you need two to three raw potatoes grated 2 to 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour that is mega 1 egg beaten salt to taste half a teaspoon of black pepper powder softened butter for pan frying great the raw potatoes and soak it at least for half an hour in water now drain the excess water and pat dry all the potatoes and make sure that it does not have any moisture in it this will help in making our hash browns more crispy mix the egg in it and give it a whisk now add all purpose flour salt and black pepper powder now mix all the ingredients we'll once you see that the potato is taken all the moisture at this point of time just keep the potato mixture in the fridge for at least half an hour so that it becomes warm enough to make into shapes once the mixture is out of the fridge heat the pan take a small amount of the mixture in your palm and try to make a patty out of it now spread butter on the non-stick pan and place it over it now repeat the process for the rest of the mixture and keep it on a medium flame because we don't want our potato to become Brown very fast because it is very raw so it needs some time to be cooked from inside you can also do this recipe with power boil potatoes but I personally like to use the raw potatoes because it gives a very different texture if your little calorie conscious just drizzle some olive oil on it now you can just check and see if you can flip it over it takes almost three to four minutes on each side here we have used raw potatoes so if you want you can cover it with a lid to ensure that it is cooked through just make sure that all the potatoes are cooked properly just flip it over and see yeah it's done now it's ready to serve now it's ready to eat you can serve it piping hot with red ketchup sauce that's a perfect appetizer for tea time I hope you like my recipe do try it and let me know how it turned out in the comment section below also hit the like button and do subscribe to Ready Steady eat for more such lovely recipes it's me Connick signing off bye bye you
