 and today is perfect suit day and hot and sour soup is on the menu here's what you'll need 1 tbsp oil 1 TSP minced garlic 1 TSP minced ginger 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots quarter cup frozen corn quarter cup green beans cut at an angle quarter cup celery thinly sliced 1/2 cup cauliflower finely chopped 1 large mushroom thinly sliced 4 cups vegetable broth 1 cup egg noodles 1/2 cup thinly sliced cabbage soy sauce to taste 1 egg optional red chili sauce to taste salt to taste black pepper to taste 1 tbsp vinegar or to taste 1 tbsp corn starch spring onions cut at an angle for garnishing if you have a pan over here medium sized pan on medium heat and you're gonna start by putting some oil you using canola oil but if you prefer you can use sesame seed oil it just gives a very good flavor but we just use canola well okay this is ready let's go ahead and put in our ginger garlic but it does give a little flavor but if you are averse to any one of those two you can go ahead and skip it and just I mean you don't want it to burn so just seconds ha we're just gonna saute it a little bit so then it gets lit off they look but it will pretty much get cooked in the chicken at this point just a little bit because you're gonna put soy sauce that's good we've actually kept the mushrooms for little later because mushrooms really don't need to be cooked and if you cook them in all this it's going to get it's gonna wilt and they're gonna break apart yeah and after the vegetables we're gonna go ahead and put in egg noodles I feel if you don't eat egg in any form you can buy just the regular noodles and put them and now we're going to let it come to a boil and then simmer it for a couple of minutes and then take it from there so it's been cooking for about 10 as we make sure that the noodles are cooked that's what you really want to cook very well the vegetables are so fine that they cook really fast and and the noodles you don't want to overcook them also because they should retain their shape and not just fall apart in this room so let's go ahead and put in the mushrooms and I'm gonna put a little bit of spring onions inside now this is our Indian Chinese version it's got so much vegetables it's so flavorful so hearty tastehh and you're gonna put in soy sauce and vinegar again it matters which kind of soy sauce use there's light versions dark versions light as in less salty so so definitely be careful when you put that in there because you've already added salt in the beginning and you overdo it you can't take it out give it a good mix and you're gonna just I'm gonna yack up they eat a little bit and I'm gonna wait for it to come to a good rolling boil and then you're gonna go ahead and add in cornstarch but before I do that let's go ahead and taste it and make sure it's all definitely you probably do a little more hold on that's good even not the other one you had this wonderful product sesame chili oil it's hot I don't know I that's got a real kick so it means that second you know we like a lot of salt so we're gonna go ahead and add enough cornstarch at this point and this is again optional and how much you want to put this in tightly after you mix it with some cold water and you pour it it's basically a thickening agent so if you like it really thick gun you can use more cornstarch or less if you don't you're gonna wait for it to come to a boil again and we've actually broken the egg just lightly beaten it and we're gonna do then just put it in so that it just forms the strings over it again that's an optional if you're opposed to eggs you know you can just have it like this it looks so good it's coming to a good boy and you're gonna put it in very slowly and I'm gonna keep stirring it so looks great this is perfect for cold weather which is coming right now it's ready to go so what you're gonna do is we're gonna put it in a bowl and you're gonna put some spring onions on top it's ready to eat there's a join us again on another episode of show me the curry calm I need a pinch of spice to your life
