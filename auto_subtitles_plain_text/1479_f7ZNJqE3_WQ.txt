 okay all right welcome back inside in the kitchen my name is of course Kent Holtzman and this week's episode was dedicated to one of my international viewers and I welcome all my international viewers to watching my recipes I'm honored that people across the world are watching my videos and she specifically requested a recipe that it was near and dear to her heart Wienerschnitzel she was from Austria and I was he ready and willing to rumble cable on the treats that I had when I was in Germany so come along with me and we'll cook it up a little carb stop so I have four tenderloins that have been mechanically tenderized by my butcher you might need to ask your butcher to do it for you they often have the equipment ready and waiting to be used but you do have to sometimes ask for it so I'm going to just put a dash of salt on the top of each of these and I'm going to put a dash of pepper on each of these as well all right let's let these asides always get our cooking dishes right first things first we need a cup of Parmesan cheese to this we're going to add 1/4 of teaspoon of red pepper just amp it up a little bit and a half a teaspoon of paprika all right that's around make sure it's fully covered all right the next topping we're going to have is just pork rinds now I do a lot of things that you want to make sure you do is read the ingredients up you want to find the pork rinds that doesn't have any sugar on the label buy the ones you want don't buy the ones you don't want so we're going to put that in here and for the file mixture I need to make an egg and cream back all right I have my stuff ready so I'm there crack one egg into this dish add roughly 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and a half a cup of water keep the two together all right we're ready to go all right so first things first take your pork cutlet flip it over get a good coating of Parmesan cheese on it dip it in the mixture and then put it in your for crimes let's get it well coated flip it over make sure that full sides are equally coated and lay it on your pan I'm going to do the rest up off-camera so come along with me and we'll finish it up all right make sure you cover both sides put in the egg wash dip both sides give it a good shake shaking more than twice you're playing with it put in the pork rinds shake off the excess and put it on your plate all right welcome back the venous nets all have been in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes I wanted to make sure that the breading really stuck on to the pork cutlets so that they didn't fall off in the fryer now you may notice I have a new fryer I got this for my father's day the old one wore out so my kids were nice enough to give me a new one so at this point you want to layer the pork cutlets into the fryer I have an oil set at 375 degrees the reasons that one is because you want to cook it out of the hein up temp so that the intercepts will just do not get oily or greasy at 375 degrees the steam that's coming out of the pork cutlets isn't is preventing the grease from re-entering the pork cutlet so um the Vayner schnitzel should take about forward him five minutes and then we'll want to flip them over and do at least two to three minutes on the other side just so that both sides are equally done all right so these are basically done do a shake get all the excess oil off let them cool on the paper lined plate for oh say five minutes so that they cool down I think we want to thank you guys for watching I hope this reaches everyone great health and have a great day bye you
