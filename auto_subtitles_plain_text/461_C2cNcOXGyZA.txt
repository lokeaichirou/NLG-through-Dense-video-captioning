 hey everyone is chilly today we'll be making chicken parmesan it's really simple to make it's delicious and I've never met a person who doesn't like chicken parm so why not make it now let's get started so in total I'll be using two chicken breasts which I'm going to butterfly like this you want to slide a knife through it almost all the way I'd open it like a book you do not have to butterfly your chicken however if the chicken breast is too thick you won't be able to taste much of the breading or cheese and I like to taste a bit of everything so this is the second chicken breast which I'm also going to butterfly I'm going to remove most of the fat and had a lot of fat so when you slice the fat off your chicken it should just slide off if your knife is giving you a hard time I suggest you sharpen your knife remember a sharp knife is safer than a dull knife I use some plastic wrap on both sides if you only use plastic on top your chicken will slide around while you pound it I don't have a meat mallet so I used a rolling pin or a rock whichever is closer be classy and using meat mallet don't pound the chicken on the same spot or else you'll get holes in the chicken and you don't want any holy chicken if you watch my chicken schnitzel video you'll see how I pound it out really thin you can certainly pound it out back then it definitely didn't want this chicken to be thick but I didn't want it as the thinnest schnitzel either although the best chicken parm I've ever had it was very thin you want to season both sides of the chicken breasts with the salt and pepper some people only season the flour I seasoned both by the way my grandmother was over my house when I was recording this and I had to keep my eye on her because she really wanted to sneak in some oil on the chicken salt and pepper is enough grandma all right so coat your chicken breast on both sides with flour that little part didn't want to get coated but I got him shake off the excess flour and then we're going to coat the chicken and egg I like to use one egg per chicken so I use two eggs total and you need bags so the breadcrumbs stick I used regular store-bought breadcrumbs I don't like to use panko breadcrumbs for this but you can use your favorite breadcrumbs you can even make your own make sure to call every single piece of the chicken breadcrumbs also I think it's a great idea to make a few extra of these and keep them in the fridge you'll be happy you did later on in the week alright so make sure you use enough special oil to fry these in you just have to make sure every bit of breadcrumbs touches oil I cook these for about three minutes on each side I was going to cook both chicken breasts at the same time but I then decided not to we are going to place these back in the same skillet and finish them off in the oven I like to wipe off the excess oil but you don't have to I honestly could have stopped right here and ate these just like this they look beautiful not oily not dry just perfect add as much or as little sauce as you like if you have guests coming over you may ask them what's their preference if they like lots of marinara sauce you may want to add sauce on the top and the bottom I only had it an on top I had it some shredded mozzarella cheese I do love fresh mozzarella but I don't like the way it melts I honestly think shredded mozzarella melts the best I grated a little bit of fresh parmesan on top fresh bottled whatever you have at home it's fine I also added a little extra sauce on the side so the cheese doesn't run over on the side of the skillet and burn it sprinkle a little bit of oregano I placed it in the oven at 350 degrees for about five minutes make sure your skillet is oven safe make sure it doesn't have a rubber handle I serve this with a spaghetti you may serve it with anything you like grandmother suggested rice whatever floats your boat this was so delicious it's not really much of a recipe more of a technique on how to make it I really hope you guys give this a try I thought that little parsley looks adorable don't roll your eyes please I hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you all so much for watching
