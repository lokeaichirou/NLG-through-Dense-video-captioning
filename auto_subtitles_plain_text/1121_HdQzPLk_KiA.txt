 we have had absolutely loads of requests for some vegan recipes to have you're vegan or not trust us you're going to love this one the obviously vegan food is all about cooking with ingredients that don't come from animals so it's not just meat well animal products as well and today we're going to do falafel balls okay so that's based around chickpeas okay and then we're adding to it onion line fresh herbs spices loads of flavors Wow and we'll say with a couple of dips and some toasted pizza cool they'll always themself can't wait now we need to blend lot ingredients up if you haven't got a blender you can just mash them all up before but to be honest with you we're gonna table that hassle chickpeas go in there and to that if you can add some of our herbs so coriander and parsley and then if you can crush the clove of garlic me more I'm gonna chop up an onion the beauty about all the ingredients is that not only the fridge okay so it's the kind of thing that comes great festival food as well please then you can mash up at a bar with middle field you can be longer barmy yeah absolutely you might still need to put a pan on there first for they're quite delicate right but a pan on the barbie were just the same because we're blending out it doesn't have to be too fine so if you can throw those in there as well bears yeah see my auntie's are being and shooting often from one these recipes for ages now she's been going on a long day about it well there we go hopefully this will please your auntie so we need a couple of spices to go in here as well to let some chilli powder and you're not a teaspoon of that give the cake and of course you can add as much as little as you want but add some place it you can set more later on a little bit of ground cumin goes in there and then sort of zing comes from a line so if you can give it a good roll that means softens off which means you get a lot more juice out of it and then we just cut it in half and squeeze as much of that into there as possible uh-huh now our chickpeas are quite dry but we are adding that lime juice and a little bit of sesame oil and our sesame as a flavor you associated publicist like a tahini paste and a little glug of that like so but because we've got those two liquids we are going to compensate with a bit of flour so that 2 tablespoons of plain flour goes into our milk as one for the dry out edge - yeah it makes it easier to all you need to do now bears is put a lid on and blend away take off give a quick season and if salt and pepper War Eagle Eye chili powder in there but season the Olson after me tasty yet well because it's all raw we cabbage give it a quick taste the agency it's chilly one no all right yeah actually fresh herbs really live as well it's nice job done and now we need to mold it now for laughing can we maybe do any shapes patties or sausage shapes don't really get the balls so gold full size pieces and can take them out squeeze it you will get some sort of moisture come out of that get a good squeeze and then what's left just kind of roll into a ball try mating all the same size but as ever size doesn't matter yours are bigger than mine no comment it's much easy with clean wet hands actually do damp your hands before sometimes it's easier so there we go that's throwing up all pretty much the roll so quick print your hands hot soapy water and now we can start to cook them now you can bake these or just have formed a barbecue woodwork look we're going to fry them so a little bit of oil in the pan and then we just pop a balls into the pan and then you get a nice sizzle and if you can pack them enough they should all hold their shape so while these cook through for a few minutes turning them every so often we can put our pizza bread into the toaster to warm those through and then we can serve the whole office and dips where we have flat fall ready awesome so there we go some pizza that's nice and warm now you can step that up on one side of our plate mm-hmm we've got a pepper and tomato dip and a Katsuki dip some fresh flavors there and then moment of truth our falafel balls will make a little bit of a pyramid game here's your stack from our presentation is everything very much a little bit like Alfredo Roshi tower haha because this is a real treat so there we go some all toasted pizza a couple of dips and most importantly our vegan falafel balls sorted Wow I'm rich flavors all nicely cool I want the spice spice nice warm hmm and the junk now these are awesome but if you want to make these at home be that the burger versions or the sausage versions please do send us photos to our facebook page at facebook.com/awlimportantwords you
