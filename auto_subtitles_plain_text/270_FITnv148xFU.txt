 so I'm gonna cook you know really lovely dish I'm a musical it's worth bugging your classic French beef stew with lots of lovely things in it the first thing you need is the Chuck stay so it's right and putting a nice piece of beef like this now I need to trim it up a bit so you want to get rid of the sinews so just going to trim off the pieces so it kind of breaks off in its natural sea use this is a really great cut of meat because it is quite reasonably priced it's Chuck so it's very much kind of quite tough piece of meat and it's got lots and lots of sort of sinews in there and that's why it tastes so good because you know it's cooked for a long long time so all those kind of bit too fat and sinew break down and make it incredibly tender so we're going to sort of chop in slices so you've got kind of like 2/3 centimeter cubes and it's it's really sort of quite tough meat so it will take about three hours of cooking and it you know my mum used to make it the day before so that flavor you sort of go through and the next day it would be even stronger and more delicious and you can eat it straight how did the oven once it's being cooked but it's actually better the next day so my mother's but I was big inspiration by cooking because you know we stew eat really well as kids you know he's had lovely food at home I think my first food experience I should realise I was gonna be a chef because I think when I passed 6 years old actually wrote a little menu and made these some sandwiches sort of sandwich me and it was only like two sandwiches on the menu but I kind of went out into the into the garden and my parents were so keen gardeners gardening and I would go with it you know these two two sounds on the menu and they would sort of choose one on something you know pretend it was a big long menu so there's gonna put some flour on to the beef that will give it a nice bit of color and all sort of thicken up the sauce slightly but first of all I'm going to get the smoked bacon so smoked bacon and then just a little bit of olive oil in the pan so we'll get some oil in goes our bacon so what I don't do is try and get all of that fat out of the bacon so that the fat then sort of seasons to be the base coat you know must run a flower on it just going to take it away from all that excess flour just let's just lightly coated not too much it'll just the source become too thick so take that off a little bit of salt not too much because the the bacon is quite salty to make sure that's all goes in together and then I'm just going to pop that in the pan I wanna get a nice bit of color on it okay so we're lasting on do start stirring the beef straight away because what happens all the flour will come off and the beef won't Brown we'll just get all sort of sort of soft and must boil in the pan so I hear that can run red board and then this is where all the chopping starts so we've got some carrot some onion I'm just going to chop that up nice and fine so in different knife different job different knife really good they never have a sharp enough knife over okay and then just cut the carrot in sort of long strips that they worried about too much and in thank you know some people spend hours chopping vegetables to sort of perfect size but I wouldn't read too much because it's going to be cooking for a long time screaming for three hours so it's really very well cooked so the carrots there for sort of sweetness you know onion and carrot and celery and those kind of ingredients is sort of always brilliant in stews or soups because they have a sort of natural sweetness to them if you don't have them it can taste a little a little bit bland so that's our carrot then the little onion whose side this nice together for that so this this is my mom's recipe I mean it's kind of you know the classic roof bug in your on you know take kind of days to make your a strain everything and it's all kind of quite quite precise this really is a sort of chuck in the oven and hope what I hope for the best is can always taste good but you chuck in the elbe and wait three hours and and eat it so it's it's um it's a bit of a foolproof recipe really and it's something that you know my mother's kind of a very much cook to their heart so it was kind of that sort of style that you know is why I cook them are too but is that's a way of cooking where it is quite sort of simple just pop the garlic so what I'm going to do we're going to just turn the beef over have a look at it so some nice bit of color on it now and all that sort of fat and the bacon is all kind of you know gone and gone into the mid Co that sort of salty smokiness what kind of flavor will develop into the beef and then bit of onion and they go there's the onion and the carrot and then we're just going to make sure that all goes in together and start sealing off so just throw that so it's all kind of incorporated together and the onion and the the carrot cooks bit of garlic I'm just gonna ship clove of garlic in and then now we've nipped the herbs we've got some some thyme and a bit of bay leaf I can use some of these potatoes I'm also going to put one what should too in the stew because a lovely sort of depth of flavor a little bit of thyme feel that not too much just a bit pop that in with the bay leaf and then now we're a little bit of tomato puree so little squirt of tomato puree and some chopped tomatoes that's the tomatoes our chopped tomatoes give it a nice stir then plenty of red wine and a really nice good robust red wine you can spritz most things or you're saying quite a quite dry with it it's a good good choice so that's the wine and then beef stock now you can buy beef stock you can we buy stock use everything but if you can be bothered to make it it makes such a difference but you could use chicken stock that's one okay so we've got pretty much everything in there now but the bay leaf the beef everything and there were just kind of some of these little onions now normally traditionally they'd fly them off and with the little lardons of bacon but we're just going to sort of throw it in because this is quite quite a quick and easy version of it so in go the little pearl onions give it a really nice stir make sure stirred just enough liquid just set sort of just sort of sitting is kind of covered in it and a bit more and then lid on you can always add a bit liquid if it seems a bit dry so we're going to put it in the oven for three hours at 170 degrees one hundred six hundred and seventy if you feel is cooking - going to turn it down a bit and if it's seen a little bit dry add a bit of stock but you need to cook it quite a long time because the chuck steak is quite tough so in she goes and then this one's been cooking for about three hours and core not good right now it's very important to actually let it rest so you want to get all those sort of flavors to kind of you know the meats or tenderize you can't cut it easy straightaway - a little bit hot and not so nice so you let it sort of rest of it okay so let's have a little taste to it so now it should be really kind of really really soft to the pickup piece of meat it should just be able to break on the fork and is perfect and then let's grater solicitous just like my mom how's your perfect
