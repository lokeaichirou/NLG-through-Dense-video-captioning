 welcome back we're getting into the st. Patrick's Day spirit here in the research kitchen with chef Justin Wylie he's making Irish box tea yes it's an old Irish pancake ah potato pants up good in here and so we're gonna start out with 1/2 cups of grated potato and the important thing when you're grading a potato they have a lot of moister so you want to take a like a nice flour sack towel okay like I have right here and get the potato in there and just squeeze it all out really yeah you want to get all the water you use after you've graded it and then this is what you want after this is the starch that's left over and it will help bind the potato Wow yeah so we're gonna go ahead and do 1 cup of all-purpose flour now real quick what kind of potatoes - geez I'm using Yukon Golds ok look I just coat the potato with the flour so I'm wondering how you got that juice okay no you said because it's not yeah you squeeze the water out and the starch will sink to the bottom and you just drain the water okay picture this and then a separate Bowl you want to take one egg okay and about 1 tablespoon of skim milk and width and then if we won't be interactive so dump about one cup of already mashed potato Oh Oh came out came out perfect ah and we're gonna go and just incorporate the egg and the skim milk with the mashed potato now do you make like regular mashed potatoes of you pop yeah you know it's regular so these are these are gonna be a little bit you know a little bit more fancier because those mashed potatoes have sour cream and cream cheese and also some goodies in them delicious and then we're going to take that start that remains about you know about 20 minutes afterwards out of there and incorporate that into the mixture and then just salt and pepper now how do you recommend making your mashed potatoes oh well I leave the skins on in the boiling for you know until they're fork-tender and then put them in a KitchenAid mixer and butter and yeah delicious think with them while they're hot it'd take a little bit careful but you know they're pretty easy man the grater potatoes that are coated with the flour we want to go ahead and mix in okay and you want to get you're looking for what kinda like a you know a thicker batter okay and then yeah sorry we're running out of time and then we're gonna go ahead and just put them in pan I'll let him know for you well yeah that's it and just kind of watch them till the ground about three minutes on each side ah delicious can't wait to try them all right well we'll try this in just a little bit baby
