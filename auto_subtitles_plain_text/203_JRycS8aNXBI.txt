 hi everyone welcome to the story about in the coffee today we're going to make kimchi Korean kimchi really nice really this is not regular one that's very very similar to the classical one so hope you enjoyed idea and stay tuned take napa cabbage this is about three and a half pounds of cabbage and cut it in the middle yeah very important that you make sure that this part is very clean and out of any discoloration if not cut it through it and cut it very thinly like so like I'm look at it and this part I will cut to three parts I want it very thinly like so try to cut through the middle that it will hold on together do the same to the rest of the cable after you pre cut all the cabbage wash it very thoroughly in very cold water this is daikon radish and carrot this is about pound of daikon radish now my deccan radish is long and thin because it's organic you can find mostly that the other kind it's fat and round it doesn't matter which kind take daikon radish and one pretty large carrot peel those now you have two options you have you can slice them to the thin sticks or you can use something like this you see and add those to the cabbage I know it's pretty weird to do so but I love to do it this way I have here three tablespoons of pink Himalayan salt and cover all of them leaves in Soul and moosh it a little bit together like so make sure that all the bits and pieces will be covered with soul and then leave it for hour and a half hour will be enough because we cut a treatise thinly and mix it in between like so meanwhile here I have them daikon radish and the carrot I made it in sticks as you see here oh sorry this is the leaf that not belongs to here and I'm adding one teaspoon of Himalayan salt here as well mix it all together and let it stand same amount of time like you will give to stand to the napa cabbage just mix it occasionally like so for this sauce one tablespoon of sugar I'm using the organic coconut sugar so this is dark one and tablespoon of sweet rice flour or glutinous rice flour this is just basically basically it's very fine it's more like rice starch than flour and you can bite everywhere and it's chilly right so it's gluten free and what I'm doing it's a little secret to avoid lumps couple of tablespoons here inside and mix it together with the water like so you see it's going to be very sick and very porridge-like there are people that call it call it even porridge so bream get to a boil and mix constantly until it thickens and then let it cool completely do you see I brought it to a boil and it started to be very thick so that's it take it out of the heat and cool completely at this point this is about hour into the process and as you see it's free to solve Jim already if you see here we have tons and tons of juices coming out and we want it because if it will be a little bit too juicier it will be a soggy afterwards this way it will become crispy now I suggest go and wash the salt out rinse it very well pretty well you know if it's a little bit of salt will stay not a problem do the same here you see here you remember I saw that without with the 1 teaspoon of salt and as you see here you see the juices just rinse a bit you don't have to take all of the salt out leave a little bit take green onion and cut them for about I don't know inch or so yes this go is another vegetables if so lovely add those to the daikon radish and carrot okay this is the sauce when it's completely cooled you see how thick it is so to the sauce add 10 and I mean it's 10 garlic cloves you see all of those I'm going to grade them and you should add ginger this is about 2 inch of ginger you can add more or less but I have a lot of ginger so I see you after the job is done tablespoon of fish sauce you can add more or less as you like to this add 4 tablespoon of chili powder you see you can add up to 1 cup ice to recipes it's up to you how spicy you want it and this is going to be pretty spicy anyways it's quarter cup like four tablespoons and 1 tablespoon I'm aging a paprika this is sweet paprika I'm eating it just for the color because it's bright orange I want everything to be very bright and orange so now mix all together it's dark it's brownish in color but it's like it's bloody brownish amazing so this add to your vegetables and mix everything very very very well it's not phenomenal mix all together and this is going to be based to our kimchi too long amazing now cover all the leaves one by one with this vegetables and sauce like so you see I have here would say this part I'm thinking there this with my hand and just cover and everything inside and out and this way all the parts will get the sauce from kimchi then next and so on and so forth you know transfer your kimchi to glass or plastic container and let it stand outside for 24-48 hours now my house is very hot so 24 hours will be okay and then I will take it inside the refrigerator if your house is cold then you can take it up to 48 hours and it will be much sour if there is a world you can start to eat it now by the way it's pretty good now already oh and don't forget to pop the lid on it's very important for the fermentation process this is 48 hours later let's try it's spicy it's lovely I love all the vegetables inside it's not overly spicy so you love spicier and more cheesy for short
