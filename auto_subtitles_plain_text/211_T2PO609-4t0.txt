 [Music] you [Music] you hi guys what we're gonna be cooking today is an English classic bangers and mash also a sausage and mash it's an absolute classic so what I'm gonna be using is there some sage this is for the gravy parsley for some little bit of freshness I'm gonna use some beer for the gravy some stock some potatoes strong potatoes for the mashed potato onion that's for the onion gravy and some bangers now guys make sure that you use English bangers not Italian sausage I mean you can but you won't have the same effect if you use proper English bangers and these are from my butchers so I have to get cuz I live in Atlanta so we start to get English bangers from around from so I've got this butchers and he does it for me so fantastic so let's get started okay first of all guys get a saute pan add some olive oil and what we're gonna do is gonna Brown the sausages off give its enemies over that's what you want like that [Music] okay so these grounds on each side so we'll take them out so guys I've taken the sausages out and what's left is this goodness you've got the olive oil you've got the fat from the sausages and that will flavor the gravy beautiful so guys we're gonna make the onion gravy now all you got to do is slice one on him [Music] okay guys you want to cook these until they're nice and brown about 15 minutes so keep staring for the 19th caramelize and then we'll put the stock in okay guys as you can see these are at about 15 minutes and the nice bit Brown and softened so long do and we have a little bit of flour just to give it some body pinch then we're gonna cook that out about one minute just to get rid of that green in us and this will give a nice body on the gravy you don't want the gravy too thick I want my gravy a little runny but it's up to you so we'll cook that out one minute and then we'll add the stock in we have the stock next up the beer okay guys I've got the stock about the beer and what we're going to do is going to bring that up to a boil and then we're going to be juice it for about five minutes so guys what else I'm going to put in the gravy is some nice sage so I'm going to shift anodd the sage roll it up and lightly slice it and some nice Italian flat-leaf parsley just woof Lee chopped cause what dude okay guys the gravy is being reducing for about five minutes let's took off the heat one when I had there's some some sage and some parsley give that a stir okay next we have the sausages and this will make the sausage is very nice and tender and also I'll give the gravy a nice flavor cooking with the sausages and we're going to put that in the oven okay guys must be tea they're very very simple I'm gonna be cooking my potatoes with the skins on a lot of goodness in that skin and also make sure that you cooked your potatoes in big chunks rather than small chunks so they'll look like that okay guys when you're on boiling potatoes make sure your pan is that you know your pans gonna be big you know make sure you've got plenty of water mine's about three quarts up there and also add a pinch of salt a lot of people don't put enough water in when the boiling potatoes then gently just get your potatoes jump before them okay guys about all the way through the cooking process just turn your your bangers over [Music] then put it back in the oven look at that guy's absolutely fantastic as you can see you've got the gravy a beautiful consistency not too thick not too thin the sausage is a nice and tender cooked in with the gravy and also the sausages are flavored that gravy too which is absolutely beautiful look at that beautiful that's the consistency that you want I mean it's personal preference but you don't want it too thick you know that's not let list let's have a taste of this beautiful and taste the sausage in that gravy and that's very important you got the caramelized onions in there which is really nice so let's get on with the mashed potato okay guys much potato these are being drained and then I've put them over the pot just to get that excess water out and then we're gonna put them in the pot and then we're gonna mash them okay I have my masher and do me a favor don't do mashed potatoes in a mixer always mushroom with a masher so let's just mushroom gently and you don't want to mushroom too much okay once they're been mashed add some butter what is personal preference so my white butter and then use a wooden spoon and this what makes them the potato is very fluffy so just generally give them a stir okay don't be afraid to put too much salt in because potatoes a love song it's very hard to Hoover season with salt a bit of sage give it a gentle stir okay guys next I'm adding milk just to get it smooth just like a little bit a little bit of milk add that and gently stir don't all just herb mashed potatoes [Music] so there you go guys bangers and mash absolutely fantastic happy with the gravy the caramelized onions was flavors a lot got the beautiful mashed potato the bangers hmm give it a go guys you'll love it thanks guys
