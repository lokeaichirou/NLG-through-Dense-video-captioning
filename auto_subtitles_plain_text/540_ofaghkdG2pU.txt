 hi this is alia and today is very exciting because we're going to learn how to cook something that not many people cook at home we're going to make mussels in French we call the wood in a Moroccan Boozer book so when I have two restaurants I notice that many people order them for appetizer appetizer or main dish with tomato sauce or broth or whatever but I don't see many people cook in them at home and I think the reason is they think it's difficult but today I'm here to prove to you how easy it is to make mussels at home they're super easy to make they're delicious because we're going to make them more rockin style with tomato sauce and Sharmila spices you are going to love this recipe and on top of that when you put it on your table people are going to think you're a professional chef and I promise that so that's it let's start the most important step is this one make sure that the mussels are fresh and the way to test this is of course you buy the fresh and then here I put them in cold water and as you notice they're closed they're not open and even if they're a little open if I push a little bit on the mussel is going to close itself if the mussel is open and doesn't close in cold water or when you touch it then throw it right away it means it's dead the mussels are alive and that's why they react to the cold water unfortunately we have to cook them alive but you'll forget this fact when you eat them because they're very yummy so if one of the mussels is dead it means it's going to be toxic and you're going to get sick okay so really really important and also make sure you wash your mussels very well and you scrub them and clean I've already done that so I'm ready to cook them we need a large pot so on medium-high heat drizzle the olive oil add the tomato sauce and this is place tomato sauce from a can add a chopped tomato to get a little more texture here we have chopped garlic YUM I'll add half of the parsley and cilantro now and half later so keep that for later and for the spices I have paprika cumin salt and pepper and that's it mix it all cover your pot and cook it for a few minutes until the tomatoes start bubbling so they're hot enough and they start bubbling after five minutes you notice the tomato is basically boiling the tomato sauce so mix it well and now add the muscles and I drained them from the water so just them directly mixed up see this one is broken so I'm going to take it away I didn't see it but this one is broken no boy it's getting my sauce anyway so now just mix all of them like this cover your pot and cook the mussels for around 10 minutes on medium high heat from time to time check on the mussels make sure there's enough liquid in the pot so the tomato sauce is there that's good otherwise if it's um not enough you can add a little bit of water but here I didn't even have water and as you notice the mussels start opening and that's a good sign which is now they're of course dying and cooking so they should open so that's good so continue cooking them our muscles are I cook them for around 15 minutes as you can see the sauce is thicker they're all opened up this is perfect and now I'm going to add the rest of the parsley and cilantro so I'll just mix it in it's fresh and tasty yeah and that's it now I'm ready to serve them and that's it the mussels are ready wasn't that easy right I promise you it's a very very easy recipe but look how it looks it's like a dish from a restaurant is like a professional chef make this right and I'm going to taste it for you you serve it with bread baguette French bread Italian bread whatever bread you want crusty bread and so you use the bread to dip it in the sauce look at this sauce Oh YUM and it smells oh my God look at this mmm mmm so good it's really really good mmm let me just a mouthful for you Wow mmm the sauce is so flavorful just all the steps they're so easy you can feel that all the spices and it's warm and the flavors are like my home Oh YUM wanna taste it again my cat is meowing here haha big visit she's here she's smelling it as well hmm you want some okay now just for me mmm yeah you have to try this and let me know what you think and the recipe the link to the recipe and the ingredients are in the bath beneath on the video in the About section then check me out on Facebook I'm very active there that's it benefitting by
