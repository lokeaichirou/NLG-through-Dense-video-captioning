 the years I have tried many different non versions and today I'm going to share with you my favorite so let's get started our three cups of flour we'll go ahead and add half a teaspoon of baking powder 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt so in our all-purpose flour we have added 1/2 a teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and we'll mix it well and we'll also go ahead and add one egg so I had beaten one egg so I'll go ahead and add this in and for this non recipe I'm using quick rice instant yeast and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take one teaspoon and add it in about 1/4 of a cup of water so that this dormant lease becomes active so just taking one teaspoon of yeast and we'll mix it in our one cup of water and we let this stand for about 10 minutes and then we'll go ahead and add it with our flour all right so while our yeast is standing we go ahead and prep everything else so salt sugar baking powder egg are in the bowl here half a cup of milk and two tablespoons of oil so we'll mix these well her yeast will become a little frothy upon standing so we'll go ahead and add this in and make a smooth dough soft smooth dough and you can add water as required so look at that our yeast has become a little frothy and that's what we want we'll go ahead and add this in look at that or nice and smooth dough and the more you knead it the softer your nons will be so the dough has to be really soft and that's why we are kneading it okay once the dough is ready we'll go ahead cover it up with a damp cloth and keep it at a warm place for about four hours and in between you can go ahead and knead it a little bit again to keep it soft and then we'll start preparing our naan bread you can see our dough is ready we'll go ahead cover it off with a damp cloth set it aside and after four hours you will notice that the dough has doubled in size the volume has increased and then we'll start preparing our naan bread look at that our dough is ready so now I'll show you how you can make naan bread without an oven on a pan on a skillet right on stovetop easy to make and good flavor you have your round dough goes we'll go ahead and flatten them out and simply flatten them out on the shelf if you need you can add a little bit of oil and dry flour your rolling pin and flatten them out please spreading out our dough to make a nice thin bread like this and we'll go ahead and put it on our pan the pan right here be sure it's really hot so we'll heat it and once it's hard you'll see the smoke coming out then you can go ahead and place your bread on to it basically very similar process like making a chapati but if you have hard time making chapati if they turn out hard try this with the non dough and it will turn out so soft and you can always make a punch and keep it and eat it a couple of nights later don't really need to put any oil but if you want you can so just a little bit and you will see the dough rising small bubbles and that's fine just turn it around and push it down a little bit this is like a really really soft almost reminds me of like a culture but it still tastes like none see it has started to get brown and it has started to rise that's what we need we need it to rise and when you press it that helps in making the dough rise look at that both sides are nice and brown so you are non without oven without grill is ready on a stovetop so enjoy hey don't forget to subscribe to eat this dinner and comment
