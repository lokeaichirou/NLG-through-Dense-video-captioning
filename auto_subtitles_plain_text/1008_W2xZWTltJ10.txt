 hello ladies and gentlemen this is chef guru from gurus cooking calm with Punjabi channa masala I have here with me two cups of China which is also called kabali China they have soaked this in 6 cups of water and kept this for 8 hours to soak after 8 hours will pressure cook this Shahnaz which are also called kabali chana in a pressure cooker along with the 6 cups of water and a pinch of baking soda baking soda makes your China's even softer and it behaves like a tenderizer so if you see if I can hold and grab one of these channels in my hand and try to squeeze them the easily squeeze in between my fingers will keep this chana and the water aside will use both of them later on for the time being will take a cut high in this cry we'll be adding 4 tablespoons of desi ghee or clarified butter drop 1 inch of cinnamon stick keep cooking at a low flame and now we will add 2 bay leaves 4 by 2 black cardamom and 1 star anise we'll add 3 cloves and 1 teaspoon of jeera or cumin seeds when the jeera splutters we'll be adding 2 large onions that have been finely chopped and now if you wish you may increase the flame from low to medium high it's time we saute these onions along with these whole spices that we've added and like I said I prefer ghee for this recipe you may also use a vegetable oil or canola oil in case you do not have key at that instance of time we'll add 1 teaspoon of salt adding salt at this time accelerates the process of cooking the onions and will also drop in 1 teaspoon 1 large TSP of ginger-garlic paste the ginger here is 70% in the ginger garlic paste and the obvious garlic that is available is 30% so we'll saute this all these mixtures along until the raw flavors the raw aroma of the ginger garlic paste wafts through the air and your onions turn golden brown so you really have to cook this pretty well otherwise your chole masala will not really taste good we'll now add 3 finely chopped green chilies for some spicy and hotness and we'll saute them along with the ginger-garlic paste and the onions after a few minutes we'll add 3 chopped tomatoes now usually in my recipes I show you things which are pretty quick so the onions and the ginger garlic paste and all these things that we cooked already takes approximately around five to six minutes which I just showed in my video for around you know one or two minutes so please do not follow the time of the video you take your own time the video is cut short and edited a lot of times now ladies and gentlemen after adding the tomatoes they will splatter a lot of liquid onto your hands onto your palms into the air so please lower the flame now and in fact we'll be adding a few spices as well so it is well recommended you lower the flame at this instants of time and let's add a few spices now we've already added a lot of garam masala in whole so now we'll add half a teaspoon of garam masala only we've already added one teaspoon of salt we'll add one teaspoon of salt again so total it is two teaspoons of salt in this recipe we'll add one and a half teaspoon of coriander powder one teaspoon of red chili powder and one teaspoon of dry ginger powder which is also pronounced as saundh in the how do you pronounce that sound so when you say that th your tongue touches your upper lip so we'll saute all this together and remember we are still cooking at a low flame so mix everything well a nice pretty well and the best way as I always say to cook the tomatoes is to cover it with a lid leave it for five to seven minutes at a very low flame sit back relax and then let the steam do all the magic it's been seven minutes now and let's see what the status is so here you have all the ghee Oh wafting up at the surface it's been boozing out of the tomatoes which means the tomatoes have now cooked well along with the masalas that you added so we'll just give it a gentle mix for a minute now now we'll add in a few more spices we'll add half a teaspoon of carom seeds or adjoin this is very good for digestion and the chana actually creates gas to some people so this is a good thing that you can add and also for the sourness we'll add 2 teaspoons of pomegranate seeds powder which is also called a anartha ma if you remember we added only 3 tomatoes and that was the reason because we are going to add a lot of what he calls spices which will add to the soreness of this recipe one of them being pomegranate seeds or the anartha now that we just added them in towards the end we also will be adding dry mango powder which is um true but not right now in the end now what we'll do is we'll add that chole or chana water that you had saved when you boil this chana in the pressure cooker so we'll add this it is healthy and it is very good so probably please do not discard this water keep it along with you and now we add this if I try to stir this along with all the masalas that we have been preparing since a long long time you will see that we are having no chunks of masala in here which is a good thing let's see that so here if you observe it's too good we do not have any chunks or lumps of masala being formed here and if that is the case then you'll be adding those beautiful cabochon us that you had boiled look at them so gorgeous like pearls in a cup let's add these gently pour them down this see there it goes and of course now the most important step everything that you have prepared in the form of masala has to be incorporated along with the chana otherwise it will not be called Punjabi chana masala so mix it up pretty well at this instance you can increase the flame slightly to medium and keep mixing it the best way to cook this is to let it relax by covering with a lid lowering the flame once again and then cooking it for around at least 8 to 10 minutes at a very very low flame and once again let this steam do the magic and you relax so before we do that I forgot one important thing we'll add 1 TSP of Kasuri methi which is also called a dry fenugreek leaves and the way we had this is by holding it in between your palms and crushing it nicely and that is the way you add it so you should never drop it directly you should just crush it in between your palms and then add it like this so Stan we cover it with the lid please lower the flame at this instance and let it cook for at least eight to ten minutes and it's been eight to ten minutes now let's observe what the state is is so almost all of the liquid has dried up you don't have to you don't have to dry all the liquid in this there should be a little amount of moisture and that is how it works because if you make it total dry then it becomes the other recipe which is a Pindi chana and of course now we'll add the half teaspoon of dry mango powder which is also called amateur in the end and their offers for another sirness there and a tangy effect to your punjabi chana masala so like I said you should not dry up all the liquid in this otherwise it will taste like the Pindi chana recipe which also is available on my website let's focus our camera and see what we have some delicious nice chana masala there this is the time ladies and gentlemen that you can put off the flame serve the chana masala on a platter along with some chapatis topped over with a dressing of onion rings and a lemon wedge thank you so much for watching punjabi channa masala
