 hi everyone thanks for joining me today so today I am going to make my southern style baked macaroni and cheese it's cheesy creamy a little bit buttery and it's absolutely delicious so if you want to watch me make it please stay tuned okay guys I'm going to get started and this is going to be a small serving but you can adjust the amount if you want to make a bigger tray of macaroni this is just elbow macaroni I'm going to be using that this is the small elbow macaroni this is some cheddar cheese this is not sharp I'm using a milder blend of cheese for this recipe and I usually use just regular cheddar cheese I don't use sharp or extra sharp this is the mozzarella going to be using a little bit of that this is about a cup and this is just a little under a cup we don't need a lot of this going to be using some half-and-half when using that this is what we're going to be using to make our cheese sauce this is two cups of cheddar cheese right here I'm going to be using these two items in the measuring cup want to make that fabulous cheese sauce that I'd like to make and then make the baked macaroni and cheese I'm going to be using a little I can't believe it's not butter I like this one because it's very creamy tasting has a slight sweetness to it not it's not sweet does make the dish sweet but it's just a beautiful alternative to butter if you want to use butter you can I'm not going to go and use this usually this recipe I won't say usually sometimes this recipe calls for an eggs I won't be using that today you don't have to use egg with this recipe so that's it for the ingredients of course I got my serving bowl right here in the back from my cousin Diane she gave me her whole collection of Corningware bakeware I'm so glad to have it I love using it for to be baking the macaroni and cheese in that I I will be using a nonstick cooking spray I'll show you that as I go along and of course of course be using a mixing spoon to make the cheese sauce so right now on the stove I have the water boiling for the pasta so I'm going to go show you how I make the cheese sauce for the baked macaroni and cheese okay so right now I have my oven on it's heating at 350 degrees that's the temperature you want to cook your baked macaroni and cheese and I'm going to get started now with the sauce first I'm going to heat up two cups of half-and-half you can use heavy cream you can use regular milk if you like you can use evaporated milk or canned milk you can use any milk that you like I think you should avoid low-fat milk because it's not going to have enough of the milk fat to keep the dish creamy so right now I'm just going to let this get hot and I'm going to stir stir this is a dish that must be stirred this part of your recipe your cream sauce you have to make sure that you stay in the kitchen just to keep stirring it so that it could remain creamy and smooth okay guys so this half-and-half is nice and high let it heat for about four to five minutes on a very very low flame you don't want to burn the milk or scorch it you just want it to get nice and hot so right now I'm going to add two cups of cheddar cheese I'm going to add a little at a time so I want it to melt slowly I want it to melt with them a lot of cheese in the pot so I'm going to continue stirring until we see the cheese dissolve well until we see the half-and-half start to change I'll just color just a little bit so now it's good to keep adding more cheese until it's all in the pot and you want to keep stirring that don't let anything stick to your pot don't let your cream start to stick or your cheese you just got you have to keep stirring this cheese sauce so it could come out really just nice and she see and not burnt and make sure you keep your flame on very low but right now while the cheese is melting in the half and a half I'm going to add the pasta to the boiling water and as you can see how it's coming along if melting very nicely all this cheese is going to be dissolved into the cream will all be one texture all right this is what it looks like it's almost ready I would continue stirring this maybe for about another three minutes just to let you all know that this is the same type of cheese sauce that you can use on your baked potatoes which you have to get a nice and creamy nice and smooth you can also use it on your broccoli if you blanch some broccoli you can use this cheese sauce also on your broccoli and other additions that you would like to add cheese a cheese sauce too so this is coming out really really nicely and our pasta is almost done and then I'm going to show you after you make your cheese sauce which in my opinion is where you put in most of your work I'm going to show you how easy it is beyond this okay guys so I've drained my pasta and right now I'm going to just take this dick up I can't believe it's not books butters this is really margarine I'm going to use maybe like a quarter of this stick just to blend in the macaroni so I would say I'm going to use about that much and the macaroni I just want deck give the macaroni a little extra flavor so it's just trying to give the macaroni just a little bit of extra buttery flavor not a lot and as you can see again this is a small serving I'm making and honestly I think I've probably made too much of the cheese sauce but that's okay it does keep very well and again like I said you can use it on baked potatoes you can use it on french fries if you like you can drizzle a little bit of it on your vegetables like your broccoli and your string beans if you wanted to it's really good on vegetables that cheese sauce so I'm just going to continue blending this butter in or this margarine in until it's all melted so right now I'm going to take some of our cheese sauce and I'm going to put it in the macaroni not a lot maybe like half let this end up dish and I'm going to bake this between 20 and 35 minutes okay guys so I've got the macaroni and cheese in the dish I did lightly spray my dish with the Wilton's easy-bake you can use this for baking cakes and cupcakes and you can also use it for baking your food place it nicely so you have a nice presentation when it's done so very quickly I'm going to put a little bit of the lips or elegies on top now I'm going to be using a little bit more of the cheddar cheese put that on top also to give a little punch of flavor I'm going to be adding some parmesan this is the freshly shredded cheese I'm going to be using this I have a little bit left I'm going to just drink a little bit on top give it that three cheese flavor you can omit this part of the cheese if you want or you can add different cheeses sometimes I use spicy Jack cheese to top it with you okay guys here it is this is the finished product it looks absolutely delicious and that this recipe again like I said this is really hot this was really really easy to make you saw me make it it's very quick it's tasty yeah let me just go inside let's just see what that looks like it's nice and crusty on the top just way we like it you can get it a little bit more Brown if you want it that's always up to you but this is what it looks like nice and cheesy buttery southern style baked macaroni and cheese I'm going to take it just a little bit in this dish moist ahead taste of vision so that
