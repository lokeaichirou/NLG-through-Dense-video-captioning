 a cottage pie is a really beautiful comfort food but I wanted to make mine with a little bit of difference I really wanted to package with flavor and how I'm going to do that is just add these two ingredients into the mincemeat as I'm cutting it this is a steakhouse marinated it's full of flavor and this is tomato ketchup everybody has that matters so what I'm going to do you just start off by boiling potatoes and parsnips together this will give a different type of topic for a different type of mash in the meantime we're going to cook some onions with some bacon for a little while in a pan add the mince meat and start to brown when it's browning add ketchup and your steak house marinade cooked for 15 minutes season and set aside when your potatoes and your presses are done strain them mash them with some salt pepper milk and butter they've put your mince meat mixture into a dish spilling the mash on top of the mince sprinkle with some cheddar cheese and put into a hot oven until it's golden and bothering and that's my extra tasty cottage pie you're going to love this one
