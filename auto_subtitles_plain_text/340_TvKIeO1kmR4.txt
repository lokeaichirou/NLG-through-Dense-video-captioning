 hi my name is Chris Gatto and I am the executive chef of uno Chicago Grill and we are here at the Uno's Test Kitchen and today we're gonna make our world-famous deep-dish pizza something we invented in 1943 so the first thing we're gonna do today is make our dough what we're gonna do is start with a package of active dry yeast we're gonna place that into a bowl we're gonna add some sugar and a little bit of warm water and we're gonna dissolve all that together we need to make sure that our water is between 105 and 110 degrees cause if not it'll kill the yeast once we've got that dissolved we're then gonna take some corn oil we're gonna add that we're gonna blend that real quickly and then we're gonna ask our flour and our salt once we've got the flour in the salt in the bowl we're then going to mix this all together until it forms a nice dough and I'll come together real easy as you can see so our doors come together nicely but if you happen to notice that you do is a little wet you can add a little more flour or if it's a little dry you can add a little bit more water okay once that does come together we're then gonna need it now if you're using a mixer you would mix it for approximately four minutes on medium speed until the dough is smooth and pliable if you're using your hand you want to knead it for approximately seven to eight minutes again until the dough is smooth and pliable so we're almost done kneading our dough but as you can see the proper technique is to use the prime of your hand kind of push it out fold it over and then roll and what we're really doing is developing the gluten here in the dough which in layman's terms just makes the dough strong once we're done with that we then are gonna put it in a bowl now we're gonna put a little bit of olive oil in so we've got our bowl we put some olive oil in and we want to coat the dough with the olive oil the reason for this is so that the dough does not stick to the ball so once we've got our dough in it's coated with olive oil we then want to cover it with either a kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap if we're going to let the dough sit at room temperature it will take approximately two hours for this dough to proof and be ready to use however you could also put it in the refrigerator overnight and use it the next day if you do that take it out one hour before you're ready to use it so the next step for our deep-dish pizza is we want to make our sauce and what we do is we take some ground Tomatoes we place them into a mixing bowl then we're going to add a little bit of dried oregano and some dry basil and some grated Romano cheese and we're just going to mix these all together to incorporate them and then we're going to set this aside so now we're ready to make our deep-dish pizza our dough has been proofing for two hours and it's approximately doubled in size and what you need is a deep dish pan well you could use a cake pan this is 12 inches and it's about approximately at one and a half inches in height so we want to take our dough out of the bowl and we're just going to place it into the pan and then we're going to take our hands and we're just going to work the dough into the pan we want to evenly spread it along the bottom and into the corners and then we're gonna take our fingertips and we're gonna work that dough up the sides of the pan and if the dough is properly made it should work very easy we make our dough every day fresh and all the restaurants and it is so good we're then going to take both provolone and mozzarella cheese and we're gonna lay the slices of cheese on top of the dough and obviously with all the cheese we put in here it'll be overlapping so first thing we have is our provolone then we take our sliced mozzarella the beauty of this is we have the sharpness of the provolone and the mildness of the mozzarella and together they create a fantastic combination once we've got the cheese into the pan we then one more time want to take our fingers and really press the dough cause you'll see it'll start to come away from the sides so we want to make sure that we press it in there good and tight now that we have our cheese in there we're going to take our tomato mixture that we made a little earlier we're going to place that on top of the cheese and then we're going to spread it evenly over the entire pizza make sure we get it all covered and then once we've got that we're taking our pepperoni now we're gonna evenly distribute the pepperoni over the top of the sauce once we've got that our pizza is ready to bake we're gonna bake this in a 475 degree oven for approximately 25 to 30 minutes what you'll see is that the dough will get nice and golden-brown and it will start to pull away from the sides when the pizza is done so here we have our finished deep-dish pizza as you can see the edges are nice and golden-brown the dough is pulled away from the sides of the pan and because of the amount of oil in both the dough and we put in the bowl the pizza will not stick so now you two can make our world-famous deep-dish munot pizza at home enjoy
