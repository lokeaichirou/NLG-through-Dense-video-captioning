 hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the cooking with Riley show and today we'll be making potstickers have that in a nice broth they're nice and steamy so our first step is to make the dough it is just a very simple though it's just your basic dough recipe doesn't have a lot of flavor but it gets the job done so our first step is to add some flour into a bowl you don't need to sift this flower anything you can just dump it in straight from the bag so throw that flour in there that's two cups all-purpose flour you don't need to use any special high-gluten flour for this and our next step is to add half a cup of warm water and now just using floured hands just kind of work this like I'm doing here until it comes together into a ball then you're going to turn it out onto your surface and flour that surface as well that's up about three minutes into the kneading this is how you need it you just kind of pick it up flip it over and smoosh it with your hand and you're just going to want to need this until it's nice and smooth like we have here and to make the wrappers there are two different methods i'm going to show you two different easy ways this is my favorite one right here you roll it out with a rolling pin then cut it with like a cookie cutter or a cup but this does take a while and this is a kind of tedious work so you're just go on a roll it out and tell us a nice even thickness and that took me about 20 25 minutes so you're really going to want to roll it out until it's like this thickness very thin almost as soon as you can get it so I'm just giving a nice another role here to make sure everything is all even texture or not textured even thickness sorry about that that's looking great so our next step is to take a cup or something like that I just use a big cup and cut out circles and the reason you use a cup not a knife is so they all stay at the same shape and you just want to do close together like I realize I need to do here so use all that dough that you can as you can see here I've used it all up and I'm just going to need it I don't want to waste that dough knead it back together and show you the second method so for the second method you roll it out into a log your dough and you're just going to take a serrated knife cuts thick chunks like that and it's sort of like Aoki the process that you're doing here so just cut all your dough into thin strips and you're just going to roll this out the reason I don't like this too much it because it can either get too long or too wide it's hard to get it into a circle like you want but just do the process and I'm as I'm doing it here I usually just roll it out really thin and then cut it with the cup and this is what you're left with we got some pot sticker wrappers so now let's get started on our filling so for the filling will need ground pork it's just a bowl to mix it in some salt and pepper chicken stock so soy sauce sugar garlic and ginger scallion and toasted sesame oil and of course our pot sticker wrappers so let's get started on that feeling so let's drop our ground pork into a bowl add the garlic and ginger add the sugar add the soy sauce add the toasted sesame oil and you just want to make sure you get everything out of the bowl as you can see I miss some soy sauce there and add your scallion and you're also going to want to season this lightly with salt since there is lots of salt and soy sauce and you're going to want to season heavily with black pepper it's a nice generous seasoning so now using any utensil that you have on hand just mix it up until it's all mixed together and this is what you're left with so now let's fold our pot stickers I'm not very good at this I hate to say it this is my first time making pot sticker so don't use my tips as you can see there's some irregular shape ones in the back you just want to kind of make it kiss at the top like a cannoli if you've ever made those before and then you're going to want to pinch it and fold it too you're only going to want to pinch one layer fold it to the first or the other layer sorry I'm not free good at this as I said before just you could probably find some better tutorials on YouTube don't take my instructions but you kind of wanted that shape like that it's kind of like almost like a little purse so now you just want to use a repeat that process of course for all your dumpling wrappers and you're feeling and now we're going to get onto the cooking process so into a large pan I have some canola oil that's been heating up for a little while just going to drop our pot stickers in there you can fill up the whole pan you don't have to worry about not crowding it and my camera went a little out of focus their didn't want to cooperate and you just want to brown the bottoms lightly and that will take a few minutes now this stage our bottoms are getting a little bit Brown and this is where you're going to want to add your chicken stock and soy sauce and you're just going to give them a pan a little shake to make sure they're not sticking every once in a while so some chicken stock it will sizzle a lot at this stage and you just want to be careful when you're doing this it could catch on fire the hot oil and I decided I didn't have enough chicken stock there so I added some more straight from the carton is about a half a cup to three-quarters of a cup of chicken stock and you never want to let the pan dry out in this process so add your soy sauce it's about a tablespoon of soy sauce and cover you're going to want to cover that and let them steam for about eight minutes until the pork is cooked through and that's why you're left with just a beautiful pot sticker so now you can serve these any way you like I did it in a nice Chinese chicken broth and topped with some green onion so thanks for watching guys Riley out
