 let's now cover some role slicing techniques hold the roll with bent fingers so as to keep your fingertips curled away from the blade of the knife this is a professional chefs technique and may take some practice long slicing motion will tear the roll so use a sawing motion back and forth just like sawing a log also wipe your blade clean every three or four cuts to prevent the blade from dragging the rice and the filling cut the roll in half cut the half in half again and cut that half in half again so you'll have even slices of sushi roll cut the roll into a total of eight pieces don't forget to get all your sushi supplies and foods sushi magic calm now we'll make spicy ahi tuna roll if you're new to rolling use two-thirds of a sheet of nori this allows the filling to be rolled up easily I'm using a half a sheet of nori here to be authentic like a sushi chef now spread the rice very thin on top of the nori no more than a quarter of an inch thick this is one of the smaller rolls so remember not to add too much rice or filling all the roll won't close up at the seams cut strips of ahi tuna no more than half an inch thick and lay strips across the rice apply some sriracha chili sauce and spread with a knife if you don't like spicy leave out the hot sauce fold and tuck keep the map taut as you roll serve with pickled ginger wasabi and soy sauce
