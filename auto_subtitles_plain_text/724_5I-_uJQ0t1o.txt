 hi this is alia and welcome back to cookingwithalia the show that brings to you the flavors of Morocco as you can see we have a new kitchen here it's because I moved to Seoul Korea and you can follow all my adventures in cooking really a Putnam style series the new series of there however it doesn't mean that the cooking of the Lea videos are going to stop because we're going to continue today I'm going to show you a dish that's very popular in Morocco especially the north of Morocco and it's been a habit in Spain and I've had it in Seoul Korea and our rice is fried squid or we call fried calamari squid apparently it is very very popular in Korea you can find it everywhere and it's very cheap so basically I got two of these for like three dollars it's really really cheap so I'm going to show you how to clean the squid how to quit cutting it mix and have to fry it Moroccan style so let's start first let me show you how to cut the discs wait so here is my scoot here right below the eyes I'm going to cut this portion you can see there is something here just squeeze it and remove this you don't want this you don't need it this is basically the squid peak so this food is like a bird it has a beak see so we're throwing this and we're keeping these tentacles but with the tentacles you see these little things here if you touch them they're like actually plasticky and because they suck um so you want to scrape these off like this let's give them a little scrape as Neagle you can also just do it with your hands you can go like this and they moved so now that the tentacles are clean I'm just going to keep them here so we use them here you have the head I would just pull the head and pull everything that comes with it so I pulled the head will go to throw it and then you will see things that are inside it's kind of disgusting but anyway just take it away so obviously don't want and it also has cartilage you're going to feel cartilage here so just flip it kind of comes easy see all this cartilage here it's coming up okay now that we clean the inside you see the wings these two wings here I'm just going to cut them since I want to cut it into our links I don't want the wings and here it just came out so we have them right here finally the question is to peel or not to peel I want to peel it's more tender when you peel the squid and special image right so for peeling just find a place where the skin is ripped and you kind of feel it like an onion it's kind of easy just like pull this pin this way see so see this skin you just pull it keep pulling it till like you take it out so here my squid is ready I mean if not all this thing has to go away but most of the skin is out and all we have to do is clean it in a little bit of water this make sure everything is inside is clean here one last piece of cartilage so make sure everything is clean and that it's very very soft so there's no cartilage you can move it around like this it's fine and all I have to do now is cut it in rings like this right and that's what we're going to batter and fry and here my script is ready the calamari is ready as you can see we have our calamari rings here and now here comes the trick I'm going to soak them in milk and try to soak them for at least half an hour if you can keep them there for a couple of hours it's even better but at least half an hour because it's going to make them really tender another trick that people do in maracas is it put them in EMS which is basically club soda I never tried to club soda one but the milk works so hey feel free to use the club there as well and so that's it you cover it and then you let it soak in the milk for these half an hour in the fridge and then we're going to fry them to further Calamari's we first need to cover them with flour so I just have all-purpose flour I'm going to use a little bit of salt and pepper just keep it simple and then it can mix it together if you want to have more flavors in your calamari you can use powdered garlic or dried herbs or whatever you like I like them to be simple with a little bit of lemon in it escape so now we're ready to start frying first remove as I fell my rings from the milk and put them in a paper towel and we're going to basically take away all the moistures like this we're going to put them in the flower just like this until they're covered with flour make sure to vest off the excess flour like this just shake them a little bit this way you don't have like clones of flour or you're frightened heat vegetable oil in your pan and it has to be really hot before we start frying and the way you test this is it has to sizzle when you touch it with one of the calamari see this is ready so this is enough is it good this is good as well it goes really quick when the oil is hot you have to reduce the temperature so it doesn't splash and then keep frying them so this one is good the test has to be like golden and that's all you need place the calamari rings on a place cover with paper towels wood absorbs any excess oil and that's it so the most secrets make sure that oil is hot make sure it covers the calamari and don't coat them too much wheat flour otherwise they get like this thick coating this is so much better and believe me it's so tasty you don't have to believe me I'm going to try it right now so you serve it immediately hot with a little bit of lemon then you squeeze a little lemon over young you can also put a little bit of pepper on top if you want and check this out hold on see how soft this is delicious it reminds me whenever in Morocco we go to the beach and come home and then we find this waiting for us for lunch so this is my lunch today see you next time gravity you
