 hello this is Robin smoking vidcom in this video we'll be making margarita pizza we'll be cooking that over a oak with fire on the Scottsdale Arizona barbecue Outfitters we're going to start by slicing up half of a red onion and we're going to go ahead and cut this up into some bigger chunks we're going to caramelize these and a little bit later we're also going to need some parsley so we'll cut up two sprigs of parsley here and one clove of garlic and we're going to want to mince the garlic up pretty fine because it's going to go in with the onions next we're going to use a 14 ounce can of tomatoes and I've got 28 ounce can here these are San Marzano tomatoes they're whole peeled and these are tough to find in a 14 ounce cans so I'm just using half a can of the 28 ounce now we're going to give it a couple pulses in the blender just to break it up a bit but we don't want to puree it now I'm going to start making our sauce in a skillet over medium-high heat and a place in one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil then we'll go ahead and add our red onions we're gonna cook these onions just until they caramelize then we're going to add our parsley once the onions of caramelized we'll go ahead and add the 1 clove of garlic that we mixed up earlier and we'll take a couple of basil leaves and turn them up into pieces and add those as well now send out our 14 ounces of Sandler's ammo potatoes get that into the pan feeling a good stir then we're going to add 1/4 teaspoon of oregano and 1/4 teaspoon of coarse brown black pepper I've also reduced the heat to a kind of a medium low just a simmer we want to send me for about 5 minutes I'm going to tell you folks my kitchen smells amazing right now this is a great smelling sauce now we're going to slice our cheese this is an eight ounce of ball of mozzarella and we'll slice into really thin slices now that our sauce and toppings are down we're going to go ahead and work on the dough so I've got a store-bought dough here that I picked up at our local grocery in the deli department and I threw a handful of flour down get some flour on it so it doesn't stick I like to hold it up and kind of work my hands around the edges to let the weight of it kind of stretch itself out now that the dough is stretched and formed it's time to transfer it to the pizza peel so we'll put some cornmeal on the pizza peel then put our crust on top of that it'll allow it to slide off real easy now it's time to get the sauce on we're going to use all the sauce and we want to spread it around evenly look at that the pizza's starting to shape up so let's get the cheese on I'll go ahead and start placing the slices of cheese around the pizza and once we get our cheese in place and we'll go ahead and we'll start tearing pieces of basil leaves and kind of putting those around the pizza too now our last topping is going to be extra virgin olive oil we're just going to drizzle this around the top of the pizza now other pizzas done it's time to get it out in the cooker we'll be cooking on the Scottsdale by Arizona barbecue Outfitters today I'll be cooking with oak wood and we've got a good fire going there there's a couple sticks of oak in there with some love and you preheated the cooker it's running about 600 degrees right now I'm gonna sprinkle little cornmeal on the pizzas still now keep the pizza from sticking you can see we've got a nice hot fire going pizzas looking pretty good we'll go ahead we'll shut the lid and it's gonna be about 60 minutes well it's about 15 minutes later and there's our pizza looking good we'll go ahead and get this on the pizza peel take it upstairs we'll cut into it there it is folks margarita pizza wood fire cook and Amanda the smell good if you want details on this cook or any of my other cooks go to smoke keep it calm thanks for viewing folks
