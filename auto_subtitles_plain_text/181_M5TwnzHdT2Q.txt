 hey guys so a lot of you may or may not know that April is national grilled cheese month and two of my all-time favorite foods our grilled cheese sandwich and the BLT so what happens if you want both well I've come up with the ultimate grilled cheese BLT so it's a grilled cheese sandwich with a BLT stuff - right in the middle of it if you want to see how I took a spin on my two favorites then just keep on watching so on a pan over medium heat you just want to start frying your bacon and I'm using a thick cut Center applewood smoked bacon you can use whatever you want so just grill that until it becomes nice and crispy and in the meantime all of that is flying away I'm going to take four pieces of bread I'm using potato bread and you want to butter one side of each piece of bread after you have the bread buttered you just want to lay the buttered side flat down on to a pan and then you're gonna add your cheese and on this one I'm adding a sharp cheddar cheese and it's just a whole brick that you can buy and I shredded it myself so you want to add that to one of the pieces and then again on the other side and you can use whatever cheese you want you can use how much you want it depends on you so then you want to take your other piece of bread with the butter side up this time place it right on top and then what I like to do is just put a lid over so the cheese melts in the middle GUI once your cheese has melted you want to flip the bread over and it's gonna have these nice grill marks if you don't have a pan with these like grill marks hip things you can use a regular griddle you can use whatever you want you just want to make sure that you have your heat on low just so difficult for and get to brown on the outside before the now what I like to do is turn the heat off and just put a lid over it so it seems just to make sure everything inside is melted and now it's time to assemble so you want to take one of your sandwiches and I just put a little bit of mayonnaise on one side I put down some Tomatoes some lettuce and then you want to add your bacon and assemble everything how do you want me my avocado you can add whatever you want the creations are endless and after you have your bacon on you want to top it with the other top of that grilled cheese sandwich press it down together and that is what it looks like if you want to cut this in and these you want to serve when they're nice and hot so the cheese Bewdley and melty out hope you guys like this video and until next time bye guys
