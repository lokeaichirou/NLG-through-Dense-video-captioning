 [Music] hello and welcome to she's got flavor I am so excited today because we are going to be doing one of our well my rather favorite comfort foods and that is macaroni and cheese you're going to absolutely love it a lot of people are intimidated by macaron baked macaroni and cheese but it's really just four stages you have your noodles that you have to cook and season up you have your roux your cheese rule that you'll have to make and then you have your topping that's going to go on top of the mac and cheese and then we're just going to bake it in the oven so just four simple steps it really is easy also if you rather cook your macaroni cheese on the stovetop if you visit my website at wwe.com and look under video recipes you'll see a video for stovetop macaroni and cheese all right so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that you want to do is you want to go ahead and cook your macaroni noodles just as instructed on the back of the box and I've already done that and I'm just gonna use the same pot here this large saucepan that I use to cook my macaroni noodles in and what I'm gonna do is just put that on on a little bit of heat because we're going to start to make our roux in just a few minutes but before I do that I'm gonna get my macaroni noodles here and I'm just gonna put them into a bowl okay because what I like to do and some people don't do this they don't take this step but I like to actually season my noodles up before I put it into my cheese roux so what I've done is I just poured the macaroni noodles and they're already done and then I'm just going to put in a little bit of olive oil and some butter and in order to get the direct exact measurements all you have to do is go to my website at wwe.com and you can find all the exact measurements so I put the olive oil in the butter in and I'm just going to stir that up so that all of our all of my noodles have a little bit of butter a little bit of olive oil and then the next thing that I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and season it so I'm gonna take a little bit of sea salt love me some sea salt wonderful flavor so I'll put a little bit of sea salt inside my noodles I'm also gonna add a little bit of pepper just a little bit of the pepper because it's a little bit hot I'm also going to add some granulated garlic another great seasoning for great flavor I'm gonna add that right in and then the last things I think I'm gonna add is a little bit of Old Bay I know you're thinking okay what that's seafood but trust me I am the queen of flavor you're gonna love it so just put a little bit of Old Bay all right and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and stir that up so all of our noodles are nice and seasoned oh goodness Wow the steam from this is already smelling wonderful by adding these seasonings to the noodles all right so now that we've done that I can go ahead and just put my noodles to the side I'll come back and get those babies after I make my roux and then all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make my rule again on the same pot that I use to make my my noodles so come on over and take a look I'll show you how we do it so I have the eye on my saucepan and so I have it on high and I'm just gonna go ahead and add my butter says little sizzle baby all right and I'm just gonna cut it down to medium because I don't want my butter all my room to burn all right so I'm just gonna let that melt down see that butter just melting down real nice and again you can get the exact measurements from WWE's got flavor calm and they'll give you the exact measurements for these recipes and a whole lot more all right so I mean our butter is pretty much melted just have a little bit more to go that baby will melt down okay so the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and add my flour to my roux okay and when you're making a roux you want to always stir that's the key component here you want to always stir if you stop stirring you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble okay so and don't worry it's gonna look a little crumbly that's normal and I'm just gonna add a little bit more butter to this there we go all right that's good hey watch it needs to look crumbly but no one could look dry alright so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start slowly pouring in you said you notice I'm still whisking so I'm gonna stir in my help see how I'm just stirring it in and it's gonna start so thicken and once we have this nice and smooth and thickened then we're gonna add our cheese and let that melt down I'm just adding this slowly in great this is exactly what you want to see all right so I'm just going to cut my heat up just a little bit a little bit more heat when the cheese goes in to start melting all right so I have some cubed Velveeta cheese and you see that here I just cut them up into cubes and that's really just to help them melt quicker obviously the smaller the pieces the quicker it'll melt so I'm just gonna add these in slowly and just let it melt up all right and if you see your roots a little bit too thick like I think this is just a little bit too thick we can always add some liquid to it I'm going to add a little bit more milk to the pan because you do your roux is supposed to be wet so you don't want it to be too thick okay guys so this is the consistency that you want in the end you see how creamy that is it's not watery but it's creamy and it's cheesy yummy yummy yummy yummy okay so at this point you can go ahead and turn your fire off okay because what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna season this just a little bit and then we're gonna add our noodles and fold it in so I'm gonna take a little bit more sea salt here okay and season our roux and just a little pinch not too much of black pepper just a little bit all right what's that in so now we're ready for our pasta noodles and all I'm gonna do is just dump it in to our cheese roux here that's just waiting for it and I'm just gonna kind of piece this put a little bit in and stir first and then add a little bit more to make sure that every noodle gets a little bit of the cheese okay so now that we have our noodles and our cheese Roux and we're have them all incorporated and they're happy and they're waiting to get baked what we going to do is we're going to take a baking dish and you can use any kind of dish I just use the one that I had most handy and then what I did was I took some soft butter and I just buttered my dish now if you want to be a little bit light on the butter you can always shoot some Pam over your dish as well works just as good all right so I'm gonna kick take my noodles that have already been folded in with the roux and I'm just gonna put them into the pan and spread them out once they get in here nice and then the last thing that we're gonna do before we bake these babies are or is rather we're gonna go ahead and make the topping because I like my mac and cheese to have a nice topping and you're gonna you're gonna really love the idea I came up with for my topping all right so I'm just going to spread this out so be nice and even all right there we go and I don't know if I mentioned preheat your oven to 400 degrees okay all right here we go all right so that's our macaroni and cheese noodles with our cheese roof so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make our topping and what I have here are three things the first thing is I've crushed up some croutons and their butter and garlic croutons and now you're again just like with this the old bay you're like what are you doing trust me on this one you're gonna love it so I just crush them up and all I did was I just put them into a ziplock bag and I just smash them up really fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add some melted butter and then I'm also gonna add some cheese now remember we use the Velveeta cheese for the roux so I'm gonna use some Monterey Jack and some Colby cheese that I've just shredded up now the Monterey Jack and the Colby they're a mild cheese and I like my macaroni and cheese to be mild all the way through Velveeta is also a mild cheese but if you like a little bit of you know sharpness you can always mix your topping with some cheddar cheese okay so all I'm going to do is I'm just going to pour my butter and ooh my croutons and I'm gonna add some cheese to it and then I'm just gonna mix it up that's all I'm going to I'm gonna mix it up and then after we mix all of this up we're gonna get a little dirty because we're gonna use our hands to put it on top of our baked macaroni and cheese so this is the part where we get a little dirty and we're just gonna take our hands and get into that topping and we're just gonna spread it all around until it's fully covered everywhere because you every time you take a bite out of your mac and cheese you want to get a nice crunch and then you're also layering it with another type of cheese so it's gonna give it a little bit more flavor and you know I love the what the flavor so let's go ahead and just finish this up and again I do have my my oven there preheating to 400 degrees and we're just gonna cook this for about maybe 15 to 20 minutes really until the top part the cheese on the top is melted and the middle has gotten a chance to to gel because remember the macaroni noodles are already cooked you made you cooked your room so really we're just letting it bind and we're letting the top piece melt down all right so that is it my dear EES I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna throw this in the oven on 400 degrees and as soon as it's done it's done I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna show it to you of course I gotta taste it I'll see you in a sec all right guys we're done with baking our macaroni and cheese and it is gorgeous and I know it's gonna take taste just as great all right so now it's time to plate this and taste this all right can't wait okay you say we put one of these back on alright did you hear that crunch from the top oh my god whoa what look at that oh my goodness Wow all right let's have taste here it's really hot just came out of the oven so see make sure I get some of that crunch [Laughter] this is another home run this is so good the crunch from the top and then the roux the cheese roux and then the different texture and the other cheese and this is just fabulous this is just this is wonderful okay as I mentioned before now I know I said it a hundred times you can get all these measurements at WWE's got flavors calm and the reason I've mentioned it so many times it's because I get emails sometimes asked me well how much do I use of this and how do I do this okay go to my cooking blog www.gfi.com/webmonitor mama finger-lickin pork barbecue ribs out of this world they would be perfect with this macaroni and cheese all right well I have fun I hope you did too and I hope that you will try this recipe until then she's got flavor we'll see you later bye-bye [Music]
