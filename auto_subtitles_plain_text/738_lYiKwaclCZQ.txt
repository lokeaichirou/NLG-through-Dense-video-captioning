 this traditional Malaysian dish is an absolute treat this Malaysian curry involves a very own spice blend to start off with made of macadamia nuts like a pesto it marinates prawns we're going to cook out some mussels in coconut milk and serve it with some hard-boiled eggs very low we're going on then lots of flavor but actually bite a quick dish excellent okay to start with the paste we've got ginger and garlic if you can peel or anyone about that much ginger both cloves of garlic I'm going to do the same with shalat chili and lemongrass then we put all those ingredients into a blender and make a paste with some fish sauce some oil and little bit salt pepper so this is a pretty standard combination but we're also going to add macadamia nuts into it okay the same way you might add pine nuts of a pest it makes quite a put a grainy paste right so all these flavors can go in macadamia nuts are for those share the Mosel all right please do thank you even better roasted but might as they are to help blend it all a little bit of oil the oils are just not just any of this is ground nut oil man but anything that you can fry it high temperatures so not an olive oil and some fish sauce later on and make our pace plug it in you wouldn't think we've been doing this for a few years would you leave I want to make our paste there we go now hold for this paste we're going to use to marinate our prawns right the longer you can do this ahead of cooking time the better they can have this time overnight brilliant it's not essential you can just mix those all in there yep the other half will cook off straightaway in the wok in just a moment and this just intensifies the flavor of the prawns yes and they going to go in last minutes and the pools then it comes up a rubbery and overcooked and when you get that fresh flavor from the paste as well as that much of Cooktown lovely also we need to cook off some eggs so hard-boiled eggs often serve cut up and put inside of the laksa four of these can go into there and they need about seven or eight minutes of just shy of hard-boiled okay in the meantime in the meantime we can heat up a wok shot of oil and start with the rest of our paste that all goes into our wok suddenly stop comes together really quickly now it's quite a quick one but option we need to cook our mussels yeah that will take a while our eggs are still cooking so we're not it's not as quick as a stir fry but it's a pretty speaking to you we're adding to our walk a little curry powder half a chicken stock cube yeah isn't going to add in some chicken stock in the fourth quarter lovely really smells doesn't it in a good way yes oh yeah in a good way it's like fish sauce the lemongrass coming through yeah all the coconut milk can go in there as well and then our mussels now these are fresh mussels yeah we've done is washed them debated them check they're all still alive by the fact they close up do you boo them shape kids a quick shave and then they can go in as well so all of those juices you have a brilliant that's where all the flavor is so they can all go in there make the most of your muscle juice people do is the way for which they're all to learn from this that's most of the flavor in there now so bring it up to a boil put a lid on it to steam those mussels open and after about two or three minutes we can move on to the next stage now we can drain off our eggs and then chill them down to put me to cold water next and they stay in cold water for as long as they were in the hot water for right correct yes I'm learning and we can cook operons the prawns have been marinated not for very long we could have done them overnight would be better this is fine boomers just being lazy and then those prawns can go under a very hot grill won't need long just two or three minutes oh well it's a bubbling feast to which we can put our final things out rice noodles which are good to go our bean sprouts as well last-minute cookie you want to keep that crunch I love being special salads brought yes and you want to keep that crunch the last few of our macadamia nuts you can just roughly chop those I a few of them and our fresh coriander you can just slice that up finish off balance out all those flavors fresh juice of a lime pretty much good to go both of these in at the same time we're gonna sprinkle those on top in just a moment okay and then just before we start peeling our eggs we can get some of this plated up mmm leaving plenty of room in the middle for our prawns now on our website we've got loads of curries from all around the world so go check them out it's sausage food calm our eggs now hard-boiled or just crack them on a board and just peel them of our eggs take the pallet into quarters grab those prawns out some of our amazing prawns one-stop and they are in fact I would straight okay you won't get awake and amazing pace just of all those fresh flavors and Wow I can imagine how much better they would be if you had marinated them overnight they get better and better but they're pretty good as they are Wow and then look out beautiful eggs on top well not necessarily waiter served but I think the color is amazing savor that perfect yolk book about not too runny not too hard damn it and the final sprinkle coriander and a few academi nuts you had chopped up and that is our version of a seafood laksa sorted it's being a professed some prawns and some of the soup mm-hmm the nuts gives that kind of grainy richness so much flavor in that that is amazing on the egg kind of unusual but traditional in Malaysia and it works really well Thank You Bellator I love it
