 mutton chop masala [Music] hey welcome to singing cook my name is shepherd pal and watching me cook mutton chop masala interesting isn't it their recipe itself is very interesting little lamby not so lengthy I would say but cooking yes because you are cooking button definitely would be lengthy and you're not using a pressure cooker remember if you are cooking mutton chop masala please don't use a pressure cooker because when you share the Martin saute the mutton along with all the spices it needs to be cooked slowly there's no addition of water in this that's the most important thing vessel up here on the gas range oil at least 3 tablespoons of oil you cook mutton the oil that you require has to be more one teaspoon of black peppercorns small cardamom 5 6 of the same cloves at least four of them and a small piece of cinnamon let they sit in here I've got some sliced onion okay now the sliced onion is at least if you're using say around 500 grams of lamb chops cleaned one bone single bone as I have here single bone lamb chops clean about 500 grams of them you need 3 onions sliced now as this heats up let me take a small piece of ginger and cut Julianne's of the same so refer to at home if you were to measure this up probably half an inch of ginger cut slices and then Julianne's there you go green chillies 3 of them slit them up keep this aside ok don't need them at this point of time after some time as you smell the fragrance you get this fragrance of the spices add the onions saute the onions until they are translucent now this would take about three to four minutes okay and then I'm going to add the lamb chops I'm not going to brown them because you need to cook the lamb chops along with this very important so cook the onions until translucent as the onions get sorted what's important is this point of time you see they turn little pink and translucent you know that's when the sweetness you know has been there it's become it's not any more sharp its little sweet so you need to add lamb chops to this now whenever you cook mutton the thumb rule says that whatever quantity of mutton you take you must take equal quantities of onion that's a simple tip which I have learned from you know old cooks who've been masters of Indian food they've taught me this that okay you know you're cooking mutton equal quantities of onion and lamb chops or mutton whatever you're cooking so that is the thumb rule here now share this on high clave and to this go to add one tablespoon of ginger and garlic paste okay next is salt to taste the ginger and green chillies into this there you go now cook this keep stirring keep cooking this can cover this also don't add water keep cooking and keep stirring this and this approximately for 20 minutes this is what you have to do so stirring and cooking stirring and cooking so that it doesn't stick no water added remember this there's no water to be added no other things to be added so I'll keep cooking keep stirring in between for 20 minutes at least now after about 20 minutes I have been stirring now you see why I didn't ground the onions because I'm not adding water at all and you see what's happened is the onions are also nicely browned the mutton has been nicely shirred and almost about half cooked at this point of time I'm going to add the dry spices red chili powder a little bit of turmeric powder garam masala 1/2 TSP now and 1/2 TSP later ok that's what I am going to do so dry spices all of them Wow look at this and now add the tomatoes about 2 tomatoes Puri is what I've added super the mutton is only going to get cooked after about 35 minutes of cooking so what you need to do is cover this and keep stirring in between again if at all at home you feel that no while I am cooking the mutton is sticking to the pan you can keep adding little water I would avoid it I would rather simmer it you know put the flame to the lower side and keep cooking slowly will take a little longer time maybe around 40 minutes total to cook a good Martin but that's what the taste will be that's when you will enjoy this mutton chop masala beautiful dry okay so keep cooking this for another 10-15 minutes dry if at all I need water I'll keep adding little at a time not too much just to protect the mutton not from sticking to the pan okay that's what you need to do now after about 10 minutes again what I need to do is look at this beautiful I did add little bit of water not too much finally I need to add some yogurt there goes the yogurt this is just to tone down the chilies that's what I'm going to do just to tone down the chilies juice of half a lime finally the garam masala 1/2 teaspoon into this take 2 sprigs of wind remove the leaves and add to this keep stirring keep cooking for about 3 to 4 minutes and as it becomes dry the yogurt also completely dries up mutton is absolutely ready shops are just divine all you need to do is remove all the chops in a pan remove all the chops in a serving dish that you want to serve the chops in now what do you see here is dry masala chops you need to have some patience while cooking this little water keep stirring keep stirring if you can avoid water the best thing because then the taste of mutton will be the best but in case you think no it's sticking keep adding little water and cook until the mutton is nice and soft and the masala is absolutely dry and serve it just like this get over in a jiffy I am Telling You the moment you serve everybody is going to jump on to this you
