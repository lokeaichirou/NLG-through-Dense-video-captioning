 hey guys in this date no risk-free required and it is Cinco DeMayo so what we're gonna do is celebrate with a little bit of tacos barbacoa now traditionally this is a really complex or estimate it's where the word barbecue comes from we're gonna we're not going to go traditional and put it in a pit wrap and leaves all that craziness we're just going to sear off some short ribs which is my favorite cut for one of them for these beef barbecue is the meat I mean it becomes so tender and succulent super flavorful I'm gonna sear it off but most of the work is going to be done in the slow cooker which makes it super easy put it in your walk away a few hours you're all good and done today I'm combining with a few of my taste made partners we're all doing kind of these Cinco DeMayo recipes look through them I'm gonna link to them and I'm sure you're gonna find some other great recipes for parties for just a family night at home hey even if you just want to pop open a few margaritas or write down a few margaritas and cook some of these up I think you're gonna have an awesome time let's go ahead and get started okay let's get started on our beef barbacoa tacos I've got a pan here over high heat use a couple different cuts of meat I'm using some boneless short rib seasoned really well and I'm gonna start the recipe by actually searing them off in a pan now barbacoa that's what a barbecue comes from this is gonna help give our top guns a little bit of that charred flavor if you want think in that extra step go ahead and do this on the grill and just use a super hot grill get it nice and charred if you want to skip this step go ahead and do that to the still turn out okay just a little bit different you want to get everything Brown nice and dark don't touch it for a couple minutes all sides then we'll come back around throw everything in a slow cooker so I've got our meat browning and while that happens I'm just gonna quickly quickly quickly char off a pasilla pepper that I cut in half and decedent I'm not looking to get this like all the skin blackened or anything like that I just want a couple dark spots on it again eight it's the kind of barbecue flavor that I'm trying to go for here it will take about two minutes or so to get there and then I'm going to do is essentially the same thing I've done a dried ancho chili here actually I've got three so I'm just gonna give this a little bit of heat you know literally like ten seconds on each side right over the flame that's gonna release some of those oils and help the help the pepper really kind of flavor our our sauce in the slow cooker ribs so I'm moving in batches but let me show you what we're looking at this nice golden brown color that's what we're trying to get to that's gonna add super rich deep dark flavors to our barbacoa let me let me finish up and then we're gonna move everything into the slow cooker okay so we've got our slow cooker set up now if you want to do this in like a Dutch oven on the stove you absolutely can we've got that pasilla pepper that we just barely roasted like you can see see just a touch a little bit of char you definitely don't want it all black I've got the ancho's that we threw out there as well toss them in whole no big deal I've got a yellow onion and about five cloves of garlic that I just crushed down you don't need to be too fancy I've got two cans of fire roasted tomatoes this is what one pound cans and that fire roasted it's another way to get you know kind of that charred flavor in there I got half a lime will give it a little squeeze there this limes got like no juice got a little bit in there a little bit of mr. shuester Shia a touch of honey which i think is really nice a little sweetness on there maybe two tablespoons and then for spices I'm using about a teaspoon a heavy teaspoon of oregano and if I can find it my cumin probably tablespoons of cumin you don't want to be shy there but then finally all that wonderful pan drippings from the from the short rib I just threw some chicken stock in the pan deglaze it picked up all of that yummy flavor and then we've got our short rib pieces which I'm just gonna add back to the pan and I will do it fast now I'm gonna add a little bit more water in here because you want it about half way fill half way up the meat with liquid and this will all kind of melt down over the next few hours we're gonna let it go on low should be just kind of barely simmering for about three hours and this meat is gonna go from super tough and and chewy right now to super super tender succulent all those flavors will infuse it's gonna be absolutely awesome so depending on the thickness or the size of the chunks of beef that you got then we'll take like three to six hours or so until it becomes just fork tender and you can easily break it apart like that so yummy functions absolutely delicious go ahead let the pieces rest kind of big pieces like that for 10 or 15 minutes before you do this and then just pull it apart gently that's gonna be our taco filling as as you wait you can reduce down some of that braising liquid and use that frankly as a sauce for the tacos that would be absolutely awesome okay let's go ahead and finish up the Cinco DeMayo barbacoa tacos I've got my shredded meat here this like I said I reduced down some of that braising liquid a little extra flavor there is gonna make this absolutely awesome I don't really want the meat think of it like a salad dressing you don't want swimming in that sauce you just want a little bit extra flavor there season or taste it one more time before you before you serve it up this one goes right on for salt and pepper lay a nice hefty dose I have three warmed flour or corn tortillas here we pile that meat nice and high and then you know toppings use whatever you want I'm gonna go a little bit I can't resist I gotta eat that low Oh peace oh you could a guy out here right on the Sun let it overflow I like serving on a board like this sometimes do you can be pretty cool make a whole bunch bring them all out to the party and then why not I got a little bit of guacamole on there to this absolutely pleasure cooking for you guys I'm sick in a mile I hope you give these tacos a try and I'll see you next time I'm never a spirit choir
