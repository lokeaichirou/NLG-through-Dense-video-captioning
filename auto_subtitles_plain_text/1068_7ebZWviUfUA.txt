 we're adam and joanne from inspiredtaste.net and beaking pattern and a little bit of salt together in a bowl we know the whole tablespoon of baking powder sounds like a lot but trust us that's what makes the pancakes extra fluffy melt four tablespoons of butter in the microwave then warm up one and a quarter cups of milk we like to use 2% but whole milk works too now that the milk is warm but not hot add the melted butter a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well as one large egg just whisk everything together until well blended switch out the whisk for a fork then combine the milk with the flour stir until you no longer see large clumps of flour we're using a fork here so we don't over mix the batter over mix batter makes pancakes heavy and flat heat a large pan or griddle over medium heat it's ready if you can sprinkle water into the pan and they dance and evaporate add a little butter then use a quarter cup measuring cup to spoon the batter onto the pan when the edges look dry and bubbles start to appear and pop flip it once flipped cook the pancake another minute or two until it's lightly browned and cooked in the middle and there you have it our essential fluffy pancake recipe you should get about eight pancakes we love serving them warm with butter and syrup enjoy
