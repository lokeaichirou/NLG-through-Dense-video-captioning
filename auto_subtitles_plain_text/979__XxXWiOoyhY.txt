 yeah hello everyone and welcome to another cooking video my name is Jay we're gonna continue this week in our journey with rice today I got this bowl of rice and screaming for something to put on it so we're gonna look at a Korean recipe today called bibimbap bibimbap simply means mixed rice so we're going to take a look at some of the toppings and some of the ingredients and I'm going to show you how easy this is to do so are you ready let's do it we're going to start this recipe off right I got some roasted garlic here that I just drizzled with olive oil and put it in a 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes now meanwhile I got browning here some ground beef that I had seasoned with about half a teaspoon of sugar sake soy sauce and sesame oil as well as some garlic powder and some salt and pepper I'm just gonna brown that and then we're gonna set it aside okay for the spinach all I did was I put it in the steamer and just let her go until it was wilted moving on to the carrots and cucumbers all we did was julienne to matchstick sides okay I got a hot pan here and I just added about 2 cups of maitake all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna toss them around slightly and then I'm going to add our base for a sauce which we're gonna use about a tablespoon each of soy sauce mirin and sugar now all we're gonna do is we're gonna just cook that down until it's reduced into a nice thick sauce okay now what you want to do is you grab a little handful of bean sprouts there and put it in a hot pan and you just want to saute them for about 30 to 45 seconds now add a dash of sesame oil if you like just for a little bit of flavor now finally with the carrot we're just gonna cook it slightly for maybe about 30 seconds we're gonna get those a bit of the natural sweetness out and then we're gonna move on so let's move on to the sauce okay let's start with our gochujang sauce the first thing we're going to need is we're going to need three tablespoons of gochujang which is a pepper paste now you can get an Asian supermarket or the Korean grocery to that we're going to add about a half a teaspoon of soy sauce one teaspoon of vinegar 1 teaspoon of roasted sesame seeds in addition to one teaspoon of sesame oil now to that we're going to add one of those bulbs of our roasted garlic so just squeeze it in there and teaspoon of honey now what you're gonna want to do with that is just mix it real well until everything is incorporated you could put in the blender if you like as well just to make sure that that garlic is well blended now when you get that roasted garlic out it's gonna be beautiful it's gonna be like butter so soft so and don't be worried about using so much garlic because once you roasted it turns sweet so it's not as overpowering powering as when you use it when it is fresh so go nuts okay for their cilantro sauce with the roast garlic emulsion I'm very excited about the sauce by the way but I'm going to use a bunch of fresh cilantro one bulb of that roasted garlic now let's say two bulbs to the roasted garlic the juice from three limes and about half a cup of canola oil and all you gotta do is buzz that in the blender until it's well incorporated and then once that's done give it a taste add some salt and pepper to season and then you are done okay finally we're gonna poach our egg and if you don't know how to do that check out my poached egg video okay so finally here we are at the Assembly of our dish so we're gonna start by getting our sauteed bean sprouts there and we're just going to lay our ingredients around the edge of the bowl so we got our bean sprouts there and then we're going to follow up with some of that fresh cucumber followed on the opposite side with our carrots now just make it pretty it's all good and take your time once that's done there I got our shiitake or not our shiitake butter maitake and we're gonna put those right next to the carrots when you're laying these down just make sure you have your a nice variety of colors that you're alternating everything like that unlike what I did there by putting the green next to green but whatever so there's our spinach and once our spinach is done we're gonna put our ground beef right in the middle so put a small mound and the great thing about these dishes you don't need a lot of meat so worried about that in fact you don't even need meat at all you can totally make this a vegan dish easily okay so once your meat is down in the middle there let's put some of that cilantro emulsion sauce there so I'm gonna put that in a couple spots there on the bowl followed by that gochujang pepper sauce that I'm just gonna put right on top of the beef perfect now once that's down I'm gonna finish that off with our poached egg now where's our poached egg Jared okay let's put that down nice and carefully right there good now I think we have almost everything I'm just going to finish it off with a little bit of curry kaki and then once that photocopy is down I'm gonna grab a knife and I'm gonna cut that egg open and let it run all over beautiful see check that out see that silkiness of the egg in the texture this is beautiful and this is encased incredible let's give it a taste okay so here is our finished product our bibimbap right here in the bowl as you can see let's give her a taste test so the first thing we got to do is we've got to mix this up really good I'm curious to see how the addition of that second sauce is going to be to this dish that cilantro roasted garlic emulsion sauce here we go Tomas mmm there's a good balance right there that gochujang as a wicked edge traditionally UD does that but with the added cilantro and roasted garlic sauce there's a slight herbal power there the lime juice really nice freshens it up I really like it so that was that really good so that's my version of bibimbap so try that at home try it out at home be brave don't be afraid make this recipe yours most importantly though have fun in the kitchen and until next time take care
