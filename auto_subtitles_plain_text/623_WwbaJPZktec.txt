 while I was staying in County Clare I was in the village of Liston Varna listing Varna is just a really small village located in the Bern region and this is actually where my friend produces smoke houses where they they source all of their fish from Aria and obviously from the Atlantic waters to all of the rivers throughout the island of Ireland and you can actually taste the flavor of the waters in this wonderful salmon and one of the Salmons that Brigitta introduced to me was this and this is a hot smoked salmon and for this one I'm just it's got this wonderful lemon pepper a coating to it so it's very flaky it's very fine so this is just a wonderful wonderful salmon that you can make a hearty lunch or dinner with and for today's recipe I'm going to make a boxty pancake now box-t is said to have originated some time back in the family so let's go and make a boxy pancake with Fergie to my friends hot smoked salmon let's start by grating four peeled potatoes so using a box grater just shred the potato like this now remember potatoes will yield a little bit of starch so to release some of the starch what you can do is when you have a very large amount of as' you can squeeze any excess starch like that into your bowl just like that and then we're gonna toss it and so we're not a larger bowl over here so there's your prepared potato so let's continue on and do another of these another three and a half of these potatoes now I finished reading all of my potatoes I've squeezed the starch out and put the shredded potato into this bowl as you can see ready to use okay so put that aside for a moment and we're going to grab another Bowl so I'll just swap these out here okay and into my bowl I'm going to add my flour and to this I'm going to add my milk let's pour a listen and then I'm just taking a whisk incorporate the two together so we'll whisk the flour and the milk together just like that okay we're going to do this until it becomes very thick with a fairly thick consistency it would add a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper it's coming together quite nicely now the potato that I've shredded I've threaded about four of them and that's to make a very large quantity of these box-t pancakes but for this amount that I've just poured out here for the flour in the milk this is just enough for one pancake we're not gonna use all the potato in this one I just wanted to show you what it was like to prepare all of potato for later on as we make more and more pancakes okay so that looks that's alright and to this we're going to take I'm gonna take about a handful of shredded potato okay let's throw that in and just incorporate that around like this that looks good you see that so there we go and now our batter is ready to pour in the pan so I've made about a dozen boxty pancakes put one on a plate and then let's take a generous serving of our salmon now remember this is going to crumb a little bit but that's fine because this is a hot smoked salmon so the texture is it's going to flake nicely I just have a look at this look how beautiful it is gorgeous pinky color I'm gonna take a ledge of lemon and we're going to squeeze this nicely on top of the salmon careful to wear marketer I have done that a few times that it's not pleasant and then my favorite is a nice dollop of creme Frey or creme fraiche as it's called over here and then just a little bit of dill to garnish and there we have it our box-t potato pancake with salmon from the burn beautiful hot smoked salmon all I can say is thanks a lot for DITA delicious
