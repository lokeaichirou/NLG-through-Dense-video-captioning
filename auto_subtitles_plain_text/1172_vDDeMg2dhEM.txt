 hi it's Jayden from steamy kitchen and we're making vegetable egg rolls you're also known as spring rolls but my mom has always called them egg rolls this is in fact my mom's famous Chinese April recipe which I learned from her these egg rolls are so incredibly light and crispy super super crispy the filling is delicate and full of vegetables like bamboo shoots Chinese black mushrooms bean sprouts cabbage and carrots and of all recipes I've ever made this is by far one of the most popular all right let's start with cabbage I'm using napa cabbage but you can use regular cabbage whatever you'd like if you're using a package go ahead and cut it down the middle just like this and go and start shredding you can also do this in the food processor but you know what I found it's just easier to clean to shred them with a knife then to use a food processor for the carrots julienne them with a knife or food processor or you can buy already pre-cut match to cut carrots or you can use my favorite way with this $5 oXXO julienne tool which does it very very quickly I use a fork to anchor down the carrot and look how thin and beautiful these julienne slices are just going to cut down the length just a bit these are canned bamboo shoots you find them in the Asian aisle I drained them and I'm just going to run my knife through them just to make them similar shape and size as the carrots now for the mushrooms you can use fresh shiitake mushrooms if you'd like or really any type of mushrooms you want but these are dried Chinese mushroom they come in dried form just like this and you rehydrate them by soaking them in water at incredible flavors as savory deep mushroom flavor that you really can't get with just fresh mushrooms so that's why I love using dried Chinese mushrooms cut off and discard the tough stem and then chop up the cap these are bean sprouts there's a tail and there's a head and what you want to do is pinch off and discard the tails which is really the root and keep the rest of it when I was little my mom used to make me do this all the time it was so like tedious so you know what I'm sorry mom I'm not gonna do it but just throwing it all in heat up a wok or a large saute pan and adding your ginger garlic and green onion keep your heat on low you don't want to burn these aromatics add in the vegetables everything but the bean sprouts add the bean sprouts in later because you want them to stay crisp and crunchy stir-fry and now when it's almost towards the end of the stir-fry adding your bean sprouts season with soy sauce here's a secret tip once you're done with the stir-fry lay everything all the vegetables out on a baking sheet this cools down the filling very quickly the reason why this is important is because if you try to use hot steaming hot filling to wrap with it'll make the the skin of the egg roll really soggy also another tip prop up the baking sheet so that any extra oil or sauce or juices collects at the bottom and you can throw that away discard that any extra liquid this helps prevent your egg roll again from being soggy mix cool water with cornstarch to make a slurry this is sort of your glue you can also use an egg wash if you want but I like using cornstarch and water this is my very favorite brand of egg roll wrappers or spring roll shells you get these at the Asian market you'll find them in the frozen section and you'll defrost them in the frigerator overnight or just leave them out on your counter for about 45 minutes they're incredibly thin and very very light and they crisp up like crazy the wrappers that you can find at regular supermarkets that are not frozen there you're usually near the tofu in the vegetable aisle I don't like those at all they're too thick they bubble up and they're just it's just too doughy so I always buy these wrappers have a good brand that I also buy is called Spring Hill tip keep them wrapped up in plastic wrap or a damp paper towel because they will dry out very easily and it's very hard to roll make sure your work surface is dry and clean that's also very important lay down your wrapper in a diamond shape ape add about a heaping tablespoon of filling you don't want to add too much because it'll burst if you add too much filling roll them up super super tight put your finger right there to make a fold a nice Hospital corner fold and again on the other side and roll all the way up now this is what you do not want to do do you see how it looks a little wide there and there's basically an opening will oil can seep in it make sure egg rolls very oily so you want to make sure that you're folding them so that there's no air bubbles no pockets and no holes paint the remaining corners with the cornstarch slurry and roll all the way up and pulling back tugging back just a bit every time just so that you've got a very tight roll and that is it okay I'll show you again step one is to wipe down your surface lay down the egg roll wrapper and have diamond shape and add just about a heaping tablespoon of filling into this corner bottom corner right here roll up tightly roll up that corner and tug back just a bit just to make sure it's tight use your finger to pinch fold over pinch fold over and roll the West rest of the way up paint the two corners with the cornstarch slurry I'll show you what it looks like it should look tight small maybe about an inch and a quarter in diameter and no visible holes put them lay them flat on a baking sheet can make sure you covered it with a damp towel a very very damp towel or plastic wrap to prevent them from drying is another tip if you'd like to freeze them freeze them just like this or just make sure that they are all on a single layer try not to have them touch freeze them first and then once they're frozen you can gather them up and put them in a freezer bag if you try to squish them too tight or have them overlapping while in the freezer they'll just freeze in a giant clump and then you won't be able to get them apart to end to cook them frozen all you have to do is put them directly frozen into the hot oil just be very careful you don't need to defrost them okay back to the fresh egg rolls I've got some hot oil and I've got a baking sheet with a to drain them and I'm gonna make sure that the oil is hot enough here's the tip that I learned from my mom take a uncoated chopstick or a wooden spoon the handle of a wooden spoon and place it in the oil I promise you're not going to damage your chopstick or wooden spoon place it into the oil and if you see no bubbles it's not quite ready yet when you do see bubbles that's when your oil is hot enough to fry call the ancient Chinese thermometer you can see here that it's not quite ready yet okay a couple minutes later you can see bubbles coming out it's ready slide in the egg rolls very carefully don't make sure you don't splatter yourself and just fry until Brown remember the filling is already cooked inside we stir-fried that earlier so really all you're doing is browning the outside what I also wanted to tell you how my dad likes to enjoy the egg rolls you take one bite from the egg roll and pour in a little bit of Chinese black vinegar or if you don't have Chinese black vinegar just a little bit of balsamic vinegar and the sweet tangy sharpness of the vinegar oh it's perfect for Chinese egg rolls for the full recipe or if you have any questions at all head over to steamy kitchen comm / 1:21 for more easy Asian recipes head over to steamy kitchen comm or pick up a copy of my
