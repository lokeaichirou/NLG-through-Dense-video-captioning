 [Applause] hey guys this is berrin and welcome to where it's gonna fit how to make the perfect restaurant style chili or chana at home alright so first we're gonna begin with some pre soaked chickpeas now generally the soaking time is about six to eight hours but trust me if you want to make something amazing then go for at least 10 hours and remember after soaking the chickpeas they should have become a little soft and if you try to squeeze them they should easily be able to mash so before you cook these make sure you drain all the dirty water and clean your chickpeas properly but the main problem with garbanzo beans is that they don't retain moisture I mean no matter how many excess pressure cooker whistles you give your chili or channa will always be dry from the inside you don't believe me and just see this I've just pressure cooked some chickpeas for 12 whistles and let it be pressurized naturally they've come out really very soft but if I cut one open and show you from the inside you can see that they're really very dry well you can't take care of this issue of dryness so in a very famous book written by mr. Harold McGee he mentioned that baking soda can reduce the cooking time of the beans and actually make them absorb more moisture but the problem with baking soda is that it leaves a very bitter taste and that bitterness can actually be controlled if the alkaline nature of the baking soda can be neutralized so let's see a simple experiment to know more about this well the pH of your normal distilled water is very neutral which is actually about seven and as soon as you add baking soda to the water you make it alkaline which increases the pH level of the water now this alkaline nature can be neutralized as soon as you add any kind of acid which might be vinegar or any acidic stuff but the problem with vinegar is that it reacts with baking soda really quickly and you cannot take the advantage of that alkaline nature of baking soda hence comes in your very own pee well I guess you might know that E is acidic but a very good property of E is that it does not react until it's cooked you see if I add tea to my normal water it will never affect the pH of the water but if I cook the tea and add my baking soda it will start to react it you see it releases carbon dioxide but only when the tea is cooked you can see a cookie has a lower pH which makes it acetate and as soon as I add baking soda to it it neutralizes in fact one other property of this reaction is that it releases carbon dioxide and when this reaction occurs inside a pressure cooker it increases the pressure on the chickpeas which results in very soft and moisture spring Peas [Music] alright enough of that boring and long explanations so now that we know what all is needed let's begin by first pressure-cooking our chickpeas but this time you're gonna add some dried pomegranate skin or anarchic chilka you can also replace it by adding some dried gooseberry also known as Amla then comes in some teabags and add some water and make sure the level of water is just above the chickpeas now this will stop the excess movement and save them from creating a mashie chickpea Bertha or you know totally mashed stuff anyways then we're gonna add some salt a single cinnamon stick also known as dal genie some cloves also known as long 1 black cardamom also known as buddy Eli tea and finally to make the reaction perfect we're gonna add some baking soda so just pressure cook for 5 to 6 results on a low flame and after this 5th or 6th listen make sure you turn the flame off and let the pressure cooker depressurize naturally do not remove the vessel [Music] so in the meanwhile let's prepare the other stuff that you're gonna need so first let's make the spice mix okay so you just need some coriander powder also known as tiny a powder some ginger powder also known as sorta powder some red chilli powder also known as enlargements powder we also gonna need some cumin powder also known as jeera powder then comes some turmeric powder also known as haldi powder finally we're gonna add some garam masala and the most important masala here is that we're gonna add some pomegranate seed powder also known as an art on a powder that's it you don't need to add anything else alright we also gonna need some ginger some green chilies and mammoth-sized onion you just need to drop it very fine or you can also grind it in a blender well apart from costing and other commercial stuff restaurant level cooking have to always try to be consistent but as the taste or the flavor of tomatoes vary from season to season and places to places it might be not a good idea to use it well you can use it with certain treatments but a much better solution is some yogurt or some tomato Beauty a combination of both these things will always provide consistent taste and that is why whenever you go to a restaurant you always find the same flavors so as we're gonna use yogurt in the recipe you need to make sure you strain your yogurt properly and there are no lumps otherwise it will not cook properly now let's check the cooker has it opened up or not just on time amazing isn't it well you can't see night Jenna look looks just black enough and apparently same as the store-bought one but wait what's this there is no dryness and they're full of moisture and flavor see the magic of applying food science the right way now I'll show you how to cook the masala in a very different way so just transfer the chickpeas into a large bowl and add your masala or spice mix over the chickpeas gently just try to mix it but don't overdo it otherwise the beans will you totally mash so be very gentle and now to cook these spices I'm gonna heat up some desi ghee also known as clarified butter you can also use Venice petit Yi as well but do not use any unsaturated fat like your vegetable cooking oil you just need to make sure boil is very hot and just as it starts to smoke pour it over the chickpeas and the masalas or the spices will cook and trust me even without the tempering this combo is just amazing ok it's time to create the tempering or the masala for our chole masala so in a large open mouthed utensil I'm going to add some oil and to that you're gonna add some except freedom also known as he and as soon as you add the Ying add your finely chopped onions now remember the flame is at a medium flame you need to cook your onions properly or basically they are well done which would be something like this now I need to achieve this color on your onions are your yogurt and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes but the key of the recipe here is that you need to cook your yogurt properly alright so are your ginger-garlic paste yet tomato Puri and now you need to cook until the oil starts to separate finally when the oil has completely separated add some water and earn the flame to the lowest and as soon as it starts boiling you can add our spiced chickpeas our sliced gingers Antilles and finally the last ingredient is that we're gonna add some dried fenugreek leaves also known as kasoori methi and that's it so you need to let them cook for about 15 to 20 minutes on a very low flame and let all the spices and the flavors infuse in together so there you go guys how to make perfect restaurant like
