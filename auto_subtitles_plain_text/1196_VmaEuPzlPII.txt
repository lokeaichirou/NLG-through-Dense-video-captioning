 hi this is Jayden from steamy kitchen calm by request I am gonna teach you how to make cheater pata pata is one of the most popular noodle dishes and Thai cuisine it is so easy to make with a cheater sauce but it is so easy to get wrong so I'm going to show you in this video some of the tips to make sure that you can make perfect pot time authentic pot Thai sauce from scratch requires tamarind paste which is really hard to find in regular grocery stores so I'm going to teach you how to make really good tasting pot thai from pre-made jar pad thai sauce we're making shrimp pot ties so I've got shrimp here I also have an egg scramble the egg in a small bowl and then I've got lots of garlic now this is my vegetables I've got snow peas and bean sprouts and this my friends is the magical pot Thai sauce dried rice noodles I found these at my regular grocery store as well we're using dried rice noodle and first thing you have to do is soak the dried rice noodle in hot water just squish it all in there and make sure all the noodles are submerged I put a bowl on top of it just to keep popping noodles in the water ok for the snow peas I want you to cut them diagonally lengthwise so they look just like this so after soaking the rice noodles for 10 minutes they should look like this softer there's still a little hard but they are ready to be drained and we're gonna get ready to do the stir-fried heat a wok are the largest pan you have and go ahead and heat it up until very hot and we're gonna cook the shrimp you want to cook the shrimp on both sides just about halfway so a minute on each side is good you don't want to fully cook the shrimp we're gonna add the shrimp back into the pot a little later but stir frying them halfway does something very important if one and make sure you get a nice sear on the outside and number two make sure you don't overcook the shrimp after you take your shrimp out you're halfway cook shrimp you're going to just leave your pot on and add in your egg and your you just scramble the eggs until the eggs are just set again you don't want to over cook the eggs either so go ahead and put those in the same Bowl as the shrimp and now we're gonna add some garlic I turn down my heat just a bit because I'm adding garlic I don't want to burn the garlic adding my vegetables give it a good stir fry for just about 30 seconds or so once you start smelling the garlic time to add in the pot I sauce and now it's time to add in your drained rice noodles that have been soaking just add everything to it use tongs it makes it so much easier pick everything up move it around you want the sauce and all the vegetables to distribute well and guess what it's time to add back in the half cook shrimp and the egg give everything a good toss with your tongs that empty jar of pot Thai sauce well I added a bit of hot water to that or just water shook it around because I want every single bit of that sauce I'm just gonna add that back in let that cook for a couple minutes and that's it you are done I top it off with some chopped peanuts that's some fresh cilantro on that serve it with a wedge of lime if people like to have just a little more tang to the dish but you are ready to serve that was less than 10 minutes of cooking time super easy to make and make sure you number one soak your rice noodles in hot water and that'll help you prevent overcooking of the rice noddles later and to make sure you cook your shrimp first and take them out when they're just halfway cook and that will help you make sure that your shrimp are perfectly cooked if you have any questions at all and to see the full recipe head over to steamy kitchen comm slash 171 my cookbook steamy kitchens healthy Asian favorites is available at all bookstores including amazon.com
