 [Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm gonna make two pretty coats it basically it's just muscles and really spicy little broth out of this world Christmas Eve is around the corner us Italians are all about the feast of Seven Fishes and you know you've got to start with some good soup with a goat's it so let's go to the ingredients to get started you're gonna need some fresh mussels now talk about this in a minute you're also going to need one tomato that I have just chopped in large pieces some fresh garlic some parsley some white wine some hot pepper flakes salt pepper and olive oil that's it simple it's easy its quick and it's really not expensive muscles especially around this time of year or super cheap $2.99 a pound that's it so for your muscles really important that you clean them well and first of all so what I do is I bring them over in the store and if I'm going to cook them in a few hours I usually take a big bowl fill it with ice and then just sit my mussels right on top and then put it in the fridge and then what I do is I take a big bowl or you can use your kitchen sink for example just make sure it's really clean and filled with water I put my mussels in there for 15 minutes after 15 minutes I rinse them and then I scrub them I take a clean or new or they actually make scrubbers especially for mussels and you just want to scrub scrub scrub both sides of the mussel and sometimes mussels come with a beard if they haven't already done it for you then you need to do it which means it's a little piece right here it's called the beard and that's what the muscle attaches to the rope you know to the to the rocks it's a pisser it's almost like a rope and all you guys do is just rip it that simple and then once you have done that you want to go ahead and put them back into the water fill a bowl again with clean water put it in there for 15 minutes rinse them drain them you're good to go now when to know what mussels are good or bad now when they're fresh and on you know and uncooked if the mussels open like that and you try to press send doesn't close get rid of it he's a no-go for undercooked it's completely the opposite if they are closed get rid of it it's a no-go so that's how you know when mussels are fresh okay in this pan you want to make sure that if you're not using the soup pot you're using a pain that's got about three to four inches you know the sides are pretty high up and I've got about three tablespoons of olive oil in there I'm so good and in here I'm just going to put in my parsley my garlic and my tomato now you're probably thinking why are you cooking the garlic the parsley so ahead of time because normally fresh herbs are used at the last minute but since this dish is a really quick dish and I want to be able to infuse that oil with as much flavor as possible and infuse that broth then I'm gonna have to just do it this way I think it works really well smells great looks great easy I'm also going to put in a pinch of hot pepper flakes this is meant to be spicy so but you can put as much or as little as you want give this a stir medium-high heat and this is going to cook for about two minutes or until the garlic becomes really fragrant and a light golden color now to this I'm just going to add some white wine if you don't drink white wine if you don't want to use white wine if you don't have white wine you can always use a little bit of water or you can use some clam juice or you can completely omit that but you'll just you won't have like a soupy you know you won't have a lot of broth but that's fine it'll still be delicious so you don't have to worry about that so I'm gonna let this cook for about five minutes and medium-high plus about three to five minutes I wanted to just reduce a tiny tiny bit and then we'll add in our muscle that looks great now I'm just gonna season this with a bit of salt and pepper don't go crazy with the salt because mussels are very salty um but you know salt pepper is always to taste it's up to you if you like things with saltymom you put a little bit more in there but like I said it's up to you yeah I'm gonna put in our muscles loose as I like to call them oh good okay so now I'm just going to cover this let it cook for five minutes turn the heat down to medium five minutes or until all the muscles open up oh oh yeah that is amazing it's been about five minutes a little bit less than that I would say look at all that little juice the little broth oh it smells so amazing I'm just going to very carefully but it's in a big bowl look at that look at that oh yeah buddy I love muscles absolutely adore muscles look at that those ones just came out because they know I want to eat them right away so well mmm
