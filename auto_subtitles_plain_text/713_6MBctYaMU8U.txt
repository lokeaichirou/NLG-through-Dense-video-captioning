 hi you guys I decided to tackle this a pop stick recipe i saw on jamie oliver's a little cooking site and i thought like this is really interesting to try and make like own rice paper a little wonton papers totally wrong this took me forever to make I definitely recommend buying it um so I'm going to start making the little wonton sheets or paper will need some flour and a cup of hot water and you'll also need like a pinch of salt and we're just going to mix this together until it makes like kind of a big lump a little ball and we're going to need it for about five to ten minutes I just dusted my work surfaces little bit of flour so it doesn't stick and we're just going to do this until kind of and more of a smooth ball after you get it into a more smoother shape we're just going to cut it in half and then make little donut holes or just like a doughnut shape with the dough and we're going to let that rest and put that to the side and you guys see everything such a difficulty making this doughnut but it's just it is an experience to make like these little to make your own little wonton papers but definitely like I said by your own because this took me like three two hours to do like the holding two to three hours i believe so I'm finished making my doughnut and I'm just going to play some surround up over it and let it rest and then we are going to work on the meat filling which is going to be pork and I'm just going to add minced garlic to this and also I try to put the garlic or the sorry the ginger in there too but it was kind of a struggle I was just too lazy to cut it so i thought i could just put it in this thing but I me a little bit came out so it was fine then I have a baby bok choy and I just have a few of the leaves and I'm just gonna chop this up really finely and just add it to the meat mixture and then I'm just gonna add some green onions that already have chopped now I'm just gonna add the flavors and things I think this is the sesame oil bug tablespoon and I'm also adding baking powder in it's being cornstarch I will list the recipe below for you guys and I have the salt and pepper also adding some sugar they have some soy sauce and also added some rice vinegar add small to this and a little bit of water and we're just going to stir this in one direction until everything is combined and looks kind of piece like like the meat will start changing its texture and just a sec okay so I'm just going to dust my surface with flour and we're just going to start dividing these up and I unique about one donut makes about 16 pieces so I had like two and I'm just gonna cut them like so hey um to the fun part I didn't have a rolling pin so i just used a cup instead thus by all means if you have a rolling pin definitely use that and we're just going to get this like almost as thin as possible because we are going to kind of fry them and also steam them and we don't want to have it to think so they will like taste like a super dummy tasting em want on paper now for the fun part is to start filling them I was very generous with the first few but definitely just feel love for it to not be that much where it's going to be overflowing and I'm just going to pinch this and make it into a squiggly line kind of pattern and we're just going to pinch the end so nothing over all out and it took me a while to get a hang of it I made my first couple of what a long time looked kind of janky but I mean all it's going to look really nice when you put them together so I'm just going to start making a whole bunch of them for you guys to see and hear the dumpling that I finished I actually had extra of the paper quantum's but I guess I was really generous of the meat with a lot of them and um so these are the finish ones and now it's time to fry them up so I took about a tablespoon of the coconut oil and it's good to have like the layer of oil on the bottom and I'm just going to start filling up the pan with the pot sticker dumplings and we're just going to make the bottom of these golden brown and once it gets to that level we're just going to UM and some water to it and then place it over with the leg so I can steam but the young crying time is probably like five to ten minutes on high heat we just like I said want the bottoms to be folding problem so here you'll see I added the water and it's bubbling just bit I'm just covering it up maybe like half away or not even and then I just put my lid and just let this cook a little bit longer until everything is nicely done and looks like this so once you get this desired consistency we're just going to plate this up you see the bottom is like a golden brown texture so once you have them played it up I'm just going to dress a little bit of these sesame seed oil and top it off with some green onions and you can also view sesame seeds as well it just means whatever you like as your taste preference and then i'm also going to make a chili sauce which is some chili paste with soy sauce and i'm using the light sodium one and there you guys have it i hope you guys enjoy it and try this thanks for watching guys
