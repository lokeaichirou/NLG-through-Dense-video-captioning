 hey what's up guys I hope you had a very happy new year today's recipe is going to be a nice fresh and crisp way to kick off 2015 so today I'm going to show you my take on Waldorf salad alright so first up we're going to make some stovetop candied walnuts so get a small nonstick pan on medium heat add the walnuts brown sugar honey and a good pinch of salt then you're gonna cook it for about 10 minutes while stirring as it cooks once they're properly glazed and slightly darkened you're going to dump them out onto a container lined with some parchment paper or some wax paper and allow to cool until you're ready to use next going to slice up a few Gala apples into eighth inch slices approximately then cut the slices lengthwise to make baton A's or these little match like stick pieces there are nice little garnishing touch but make sure to toss the cut apples and a little bit of lemon juice and olive oil to prevent them from turning brown it also adds a nice little refreshing citrus flavor to the apple but once you're done doing that set them aside until you are ready to use all right so after you're done with the Apple you're going to grab some endive cut the brown portion of the stem off then you're going to quarter it lengthwise season the endive wedges with a little bit of olive oil salt and fresh cracked black pepper and then you're gonna grill the endive on a very hot griddle for about two to three minutes on each side once that's done you have some really beautiful grill marks on the endive we're going to remove them from the grill and gather everything to plate the salad all right so here I'm going to dress a little bit of frisee and radicchio with some lemon juice some olive oil a little bit of kosher salt and some fresh cracked black pepper and I'm going to use this mix as the base for this salad basically it's going to be the bedding and it's also going to add a nice little texture with the beautiful fris√©e and the color of the radicchio next I'm just going to lay down a few pieces of that grilled warm endive and this is going to act as really sort of the meat and the the hardiness of this salad after that I'm going to garnish it with a few pieces of the candied walnuts then a few those baton A's of the gala apple and then here I'm going to dollop some yogurt that I just put in a squeeze bottle it's a nice little garnishing touch to a beautiful salad and then finally some blue cheese and then of course I love my little mini herbs so I'm going to garnish it with just a little bit of parsley hopefully you guys enjoyed my take on a Waldorf salad and this is definitely one of those fun recipes to kick off 2015 with a nice little refreshing crisp twist all right guys this looks amazing I'm super excited to dig in and tell you guys

stay tuned but let me taste this and I'll tell you guys how I did with this very interesting Waldorf salad oh this looks good I really like fork and knife salads just because they're a little bit more Hardy and they usually tend to have sort of like chunkier vegetables or a chunkier cut of lettuce so it's really good mmm I love that the endive is grilled really nice little char flavor the apples are great add a nice sweetness to it along with the the candied walnuts so good a ton going on with this salad grilled endive yeah the radicchio the light nice little bat tane are these little almost like matchstick apples the little lemon vinaigrette with the lemon in olive oil the fries it has a really beautiful little fluffy texture has a nice crunch to it as well the candied walnuts are amazing I could just eat those by the handful which I usually do and what else am I missing something all the yogurt just a little bit of yogurt goes such a long way with this recipe most Waldorf salad have like mayonnaise or yogurt base dressing and I thought it was just nice to have some plain yogurt dollop tuna fancy fashion on this dish it added a little bit of texture to it give his nice little pillowy effect really great and of course the blue cheese is fantastic funny enough I'm not a huge blue cheese lover but with this salad in particular and with certain dishes that require that sort of salinity or that saltiness with it it adds a nice little punch of taneous to it just melds this whole salad together this is a great example of the beauty of deconstructing sort of the an idea of a recipe you can have fun with it play with it reinvent dishes so I really enjoy doing that hopefully you guys enjoyed this tutorial it's a great way to kick off 2015 it's kind of like a decadent old-school classic fancy salad so it's definitely a party pleaser well hope you guys enjoyed this recipe if you did please thumbs up subscribe and comment below for future video requests things you
