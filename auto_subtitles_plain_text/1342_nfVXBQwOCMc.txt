 okay new recipe a new football jersey I have zinedine zidane World Cup Jersey for for France and today's dish is penne vodka tomato and cream sauce with the vodka reduction which is a fairly popular dish in Italy and on the menu of American Italian restaurants one of my favorite dishes first time I made it was just the other day and I'm gonna tempt to duplicate that because it turned out really well it's very easy dish very easy as you'll soon see it's very simple one or two Teresa one two or three steps something like that okay for the ingredients you will need a couple of cups of tomato sauce this is my homemade tomato sauce that just like the exactly like the recipe on my channel here somewhere if you don't have tomato sauce in your repertoire of dishes to cook you need to work on that something must punch at that are we as we say in Spain I'm feta I have a little bit of come on Spanish ham Parmesan cheese cream vodka as the name implies I've already started some water to oil for the pasta and a little something for me you know for the effort some nice olives that I've got picked up from my hell out would you shop by this time out there tremendous olives there I had a glass of wine from Lucia that I came out here and Valencia community water on the boil aggressively salted as Mario Batali says I put a couple drops of olive oil in there just because just because just because I put olive oil and everything I eat now okay hot so I the pasta will be quick to cook I'm heating the pan up we're cooking the pasta dish in I like my big he's a skillet but I really like this big deep pan because at the end I'm gonna be mixing the pasta in with it in there so heating up some olive oil just a bit of olive oil because we're gonna get quite a bit of fat for me the Ancheta that I kind of cut up rather rather well so it's a nice manageable pieces so this into the pot cook this down the and I want to do is glazed the pan with this trap the heat now that will flame the vodka I know they think that's necessary because the same thing it's displayed in garage out of a tomato sauce let that come up to the temperature my step will be to add some heavy cream pastas come on I say you want to cook this a little lesson usually go for our dente a little less than al dente because you're gonna cook it in the sauce for a while that a lot further cook the pasta so you don't want to get a commission you may have noticed I haven't had any I can add in any seasoning to this you could add a little bit of red pepper but I don't put any salt in because the ham it has salt and there's a little bit of salt my tomato sauce but as I just gave it a little taste as it doesn't need anything it's actually very goodness as it is I'll just add this I'm going to add some peas just for a little bit of color I'm just a little more a little more body I guess texture and color added nutrients to how the cheese you can either add with the sauce or just on each individual dish which is what I prefer you know I don't like adding it to the sauce people don't like it thinking they don't have to put cheese on it pasta drain that and throw that in with the pasta this is where the sauces it's the pasta with the sauce I used a half a kilo of na so itself big fat but I because I made the other day I knew just about how much sauce I wanted very Italian the sauce ratio not not too much sauce a lot of people drown their pasta sauce or the tide waves is to discover it I just let this heat up a little bit actually probably turn this off pretty soon then plate it up and add cheese and ready to plate serve and I've played it up the dish with a bit of fresh Parmesan cheese grated on top and that is penne alla vodka
