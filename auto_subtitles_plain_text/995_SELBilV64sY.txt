 for this dish we make a mushroom curry with some fish nuts and some small Reza okay so this is just a French foie gras just slice and like a night nicest girl fresh and we just put like this on the Concha if you don't have any pend room you can use a normal suspend so just I just put salt and pepper on the top just have to make a nice Croatian to the five to cook very very slowly and what is the best thing is to make a nice coloration around all the flour then you have something crispy when you eat and or inside is very smooth so like this you know we make a nice crochet and you can see all the fat is going on so if you have a swagger if it's not a nice quality of the file is full of fat and here you can see is not there's no no many many fat when I buy my four guys come from France and it's very important for me to have some very very fresh water just make a nice avenging a dot so you can see outside is bran like a crispy when you cut it to hit inside is very very smooth and the cooking you have to be perfect not well done like your major Maura okay so now the flower will be ready so on this pan I I cook some fish some fish with the pepper it's very nice and you you have to just put some butter cook your pitch in the old face then on the end you just put some peach liqueur on the on the top and the pitch is the scum from the wine I don't know how I can say is okay so if I will be ready I put like some glaze on the top so the nuts will give some crispy and something sweet as well and when you hit with the fava or the combination is coming in your mouth you have something crispy you have the sweet peach and that thing this could become hot now since the that juice this petite Xing the final touch is the some fresh Gavin swing I sniff of the oven just to put on the top of the fish and the venue will have a bit about something fresh air we are this is the photo for some fish and other nuts I'm still around
