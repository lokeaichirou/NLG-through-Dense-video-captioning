 hello let me show you how to make garlic naan real fast and easy okay here are the ingredients everything finely minced parsley garlic white onion pepper sea salt thyme and olive oil and our main ingredient which is coconut meat you can either buy the coconut and scrape out the meat yourself or get the already scraped out meat that we purchase so we put about two cups in the blender two tablespoons of water in the book it says coconut water but I don't want it to be too sweet so I'm just going to use plain old regular water and we got about 3/4 cup of an onion the Vitamix will rip it up so I just toss it in there always use your tamper blend till just smooth yeah everything's nice and blended in there now we're going to take a dehydrator sheet and lightly oil it okay and then we'll pour our non batter onto this sheet and then with an offset spatula we're just going to spread it a little bit and then we're gonna top it first with a little bit more olive oil little drizzle of an olive oil and then our onions garlic just throw it on there like that a parsley lucy saw you time how beautiful that looks then we're just slide this underneath so this will be in the dehydrator for about two hours then we're going to flip it over and I'll be on the other side for another two and a half three hours there is no flour no wheat no sugar no dairy no animal products whatsoever in this it's not heated to death it's just gently warmed till it's nice and puffy and very non like without all the bad things that come along with eating wheat and gluten the garlic naan recipe is on page 26 in the lovely new cookbook love on a plate by Marcus and Kara if you want to share this video with your friends just tell them to go to garlic naan com
