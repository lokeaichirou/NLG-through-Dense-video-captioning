 time to make a slow-cooked main meal that is packed full of flavor and is ridiculously simple to prepare let's make a slow-cooked beef goulash on the one pot chef the beauty of this recipe is that it's just fantastic slow cooking you literally chuck everything into the pot give it a stir switch it on and walk away first things first I've got a kilogram of beef I'm using a cheap cut of beef today I'm using some gravy beef and we're just going to chuck that straight in in about sort of 5 centimeters or about 2-inch pieces next I'm adding in two small brown onions which I've just diced up one clove of crushed garlic about teaspoons worth and two red capsicum Zoar red bell peppers depending on where you live in the world which again I've just Dee seeded and diced up give that a quick stir around you can Brown the beef first in a fry pan if you want to but I find with slow cookers like this it's completely unnecessary because you don't really need to lock in the juices because it's being cooked on a low heat for a long time and so you don't end up getting that moisture loss that you'll get if you're cooking this in the oven or over the stove next I'm adding in a 400 gram tin of diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons of tomato paste or concentrated tomato puree 2 tablespoons of sweet paprika now this is sometimes called Hungarian paprika so you'll just have to look for it it'll be in the spice aisle in your supermarket half a cup of beef stock and half a cup of water seasoned with a little salt and some pepper give that a good stir together and that's our glass ready to go so we just put the lid on and we're going to cook this for eight hours on low or four hours on high but I highly recommend cooking it for the eight hours on low as I find the beef becomes a lot more tender and beautiful with a much slower and lower cooking time but feel free to do the quick version if you're short on time eight hours later and let's take look Oh sting that's looking gorgeous that sauce is thickened up and that meat is looking lovely and tender that's beautiful look at that YUM now there's just one last thing to do now this is entirely optional but I like to add in a nice blob of sour cream just before serving and we stir that through and it gives us a lovely thick creamy effect I cannot wait to have a taste of this and here we have our completed slow-cooked beef goulash and I've just served this with a bit of rice but of course you could serve this with pasta with vegetables mashed potato pretty much anything you like piping hot and ready to eat this beef is literally falling to pieces I'm just using a fork and it's just fall into pieces so I cannot wait to have a taste of this oh wow those so tender mmm so much flavor of that mmm you've got the tomato you've got the capsicum all the bell peppers you got that onion and that garlic oh it's absolutely amazing and it's so simple to prepare I mean you literally chuck everything into the pot and switch it on can't get simpler than that well hope you enjoy this recipe check out my other videos at 1 pot chef show calm and until next time see you later this is a fabulous dish and it's great for year round it's great for winter because it's nice and warming but it's also great in summer because there's virtually no effort you're not spending hours of work in the kitchen when you're literally just doing a bit of chopping chucking into a pot and walking away that's perfect for summer and even better winter
