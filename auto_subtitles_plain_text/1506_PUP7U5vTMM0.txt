 breakfast never get a chance to eat it Monday to Friday but Saturday Sunday however is the time when everyone should have a proper breakfast my perfect first scrambled egg sauteed mushrooms and tomatoes the most important thing about any scam when is stopping it from overcooking to service going with egg flat cap mushroom just keep them whole and put them in the pan lots of olive oil little bit of salt little bit of pepper vine tomatoes best way of roasting these is actually keeping on the vine in the pan with the mushrooms right just let those mushrooms martha's sit there in the pan on a low heat and they'll cook themselves and nothing worse than going into a restaurant having scrambled egg on toast and having soggy toast this here is a sourdough bread and the reason we're going to use it for scrambled egg is because it's strong robust and it's got a lovely flavor to it but be quite generous when you cut it because you don't want this sort of little thin tight sort of fisted slice of bread nice and thick chunky bread into the toaster every time we get a new cook in the kitchen wheels ask them to make scrambled egg and if they can make the perfect scrambled egg you know they know how to cook properly start off with three eggs now don't season it because if you put the salt in now what actually happens it breaks down the eggs and it starts turning into something sort of very watery so eggs in the pan nice knob of butter and it's really important to put the butter and write the very beginning because what that does it starts giving a really nice velvety finish the scrambled egg and then a simple spatula onto the heat you never whisk the egg whisk it in the pan because when you start sort of whisking beforehand you're breaking it all down you've got to break it down in the pan but the secret behind the scrambled egg is to start it on a nice sort of generous heat take it off the heat go back to the heat take it off the heat now treat it like your risotto you can't stop stirring it's live you've got to really work at it now it's starting to come together it's starting to go a little bit thick I come back off the heat and just let it work and just do this three or four times back onto the heat now if I had to season this now it's still turn into something quite watery and I want a really nice sort of creamy scrambled egg something quite fluffy she's out my toast burning off the heat damn damn damn gonna set the fire alarms off that'll wake up the missus okay here we go put that back in so on and off the heat right after the heat then as you can see now look it's almost starting to sort of you know continue cooking doesn't need to go back on the stove because it's actually continuing cooking because the heat is in there that's where the heat is so look if I had to leave that there now it overcook but it's not going to overcook because I'm gonna put half a tablespoon of cr√®me fraiche and what that does now just makes it a little bit cooler brings down the temperature the eggs now I'm going to season it a little bit of salt and then it's a little bit of pepper just to finish that and we're going to put a little touch of chives in there and what that does it just lifts the whole flavor of the scrambled egg and just makes it a little bit more sexy and you know sometimes you want to be living Morris traveling you can put some smoked salmon in there I like brunch arts and then just fold those chives in there we are the perfect scrambled egg okay to serve it we're ready to go on on the vine tomatoes that's why we're leaving on the vine you see because you pick them out the pan like that sit them on there I'm just going to drizzle a sourdough bread with a little bit of olive oil in there and then just pour your scrambled eggs over the sourdough bread and and there you go a perfect scrambled egg I mean the most amazing way of waking up the missus on a Saturday or something morning so if you want to be a good boyfriend upstairs now and give it to her in bed the breakfast
