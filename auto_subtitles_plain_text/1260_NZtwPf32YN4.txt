 I'm going to show you how to make the most beautiful creamy scrambled eggs you can imagine and these ephemeral eggs are the perfect accompaniment to my tea smoked salmon to begin take the eggs so I'm using free-range eggs crack about seven in here good tip is to crack the eggs on a flat surface not in the edge of the bowl and you reduce the chance of getting eggshell in the mix okay now to that I'm going to add a touch of milk some double cream just add a little bit of richness without making it too creamy and then a little bit of butter touch of seasoning and then just give it a light whisk I don't know whisk this too much don't incorporate too much air into the mixture and then just place the bowl over a pan a very lightly simmer water there all you need to do is just be patient and stir so the idea here is to click these eggs low and slow and that's why I'm putting it in a bowl set under the water there's a much more delicate heat we're looking for is that egg mixture to start to thicken almost to a custard and then form very delicate creamy lumps in it it should take about 15 minutes I want to finish these scrambled eggs with a few drops of beurre noisette beurre noisette is butter that's cooked until the proteins the milk solids start to caramelize and you get this wonderful nutty character to it so simple to make this is a really good example of how you use all your senses in the kitchen what happens the butter will start to sizzle and as it sizzles what's happening is the water containing the butter is evaporating once all the waters evaporated there's nothing there to keep the butter cold so the butter will start to get hotter turn brown and then develop this beautiful so nutty characteristic they'll be very careful the next stage is black butter this is burger than your own okay there butter stop sizzling since most wonderful nutty aroma to just skim off the impurities the foam from the surface and then pass the whole thing I'm using a coffee filter paper but add a cloth will do the trick fine through there's it's beautifully golden nutty butter like so now for the smoked salmon all I'm doing is just taking some of the salmon and just going to slice it we're looking for with this family needs is to be creamy as opposed that's Ryan grainy add the smoked salmon to the scrambled eggs just combine it putting it onto the toast and then to finish few drops of the beurre noisette and just a drop of sherry vinegar this makes a massive difference because the eggs are quite rich the bus is quite rich and the acidity xander cut through that really beautifully and that's it that's my perfect creamy scrambled eggs with teaspoon salmon beurre noisette
