 hi guys today we are going to make a super healthy dish for a change and that is a salad and this salad is called for tush and is the Lebanese salad and by far my favorite salad of all time so let's get started so all we need is Spanish onion some freshly squeezed lemon juice some ground sumac which you can find in most supermarkets some cherry tomatoes flat leaf parsley some mint Lebanese cucumber lebanese bread and olive oil okay before we get started we need to preheat the oven and then put the lebanese bread in on a oven tray for about 10 minutes on a moderate oven so it goes nice and crisp and hard so first thing we do is we just chuck all these ingredients in that should be enough the cucumbers Spanish onion the mint flat leaf parsley and we just give that a Miss mix and then we just give a little sprinkle of sumac and what i've done here is i've just combined in a jar the olive oil the lemon juice and the sumac just give that a shake we'll just drizzle that all over the salad and once again we'll just give that a light toss okay so i've got the lebanese bread i'm just going to sprinkle that on top crush it up and we'll just toss that through and you can have a little bit more if you like so how easy was that a beautiful refreshing healthy salad so there you have it a beautiful refreshing salad one of the nicest sellers you'll ever have it is by far my favorite and the tag eNOS of the sumac and the lemon combine is so so refreshing and it's so healthy and I'm going to get stuck into this and I'll see you next time bye you
