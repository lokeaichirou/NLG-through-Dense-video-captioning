 welcome everyone I'm Deronda with foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to make these crispy fried beer battered onion rings and let me tell you they're absolutely fantastic and very addictive now I'm using the Vidalia onions right now they're abundant in the grocery store this time of the year and you're going to use about this size of an onion you're going to slice the ends off peel off the first layer and slice them into about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch in slices once you get your slices cut you're gonna pull them apart into these rings and of course the closer you get to the center of your sliced onion the smaller your onion ring is going to become I've got 1 cup of flour 3/4 of a cup of corn starch 1 teaspoon of pepper Rica this is the smoky Hungarian pepper Rica and let me tell you folks when you bite into this onion ring using this smoky paprika you're gonna get a burst of flavor absolutely delicious I've got 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon of fresh cracked pepper and I've got 1 bottle a 12 ounce bottle of chilled beer now I'm using the rolling rock today but if you want to use the lager or whatever you have on hand that's great just make sure you've got about 12 ounces of chilled beer now let me show you how to get this together to the flour you're gonna add your baking powder you're gonna add your salt pepper Rica and pepper using a whisk you want to incorporate these five ingredients well together next we're gonna add the beer slowly add your beer make sure it's chilled it's very important that it's chilled oh yeah no see yummy but these onions and this fabulous battery over here on the stove I have three cups of vegetable oil heating on medium heat you want your oil about 350 degrees Fahrenheit and now we're gonna take the corn starch add it in there and give it a whisk this is what's gonna give that onion ring an extra crunch of Chris penis now that your onion ring batter is well combined you're gonna add about a third of your onions using a skewer I'm gonna go ahead and toss these around so come on over here to the stovetop and I'll show you how to get these frying I got my oil heating on medium heat you don't want to heat your oil any higher than that I'm a good five to eight minutes to heat it would be good but to test to make sure the oil is ready I'm gonna drop a piece of bread in there if it sizzles which it is then it's time for the onion rings so I'm gonna go ahead and get this out and I'm gonna add the onion rings I find that it's best to add the onion rings with a skewer that way you can shake off the excess batter on your onion and go ahead and drop it right into the oil and we're gonna fry this about a minute to a minute and a half on each side of the onion rings be sure not to overcrowd your pan oh wow they're beginning to sizzle and smell so delicious the onion rings have been frying for about three and a half minutes and I'd like to add a little bit more batter to the onion rings so what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake my other onion rings in a little flour I'm going to coat the onions before I put it in the batter now back over here in the back I've lined a cookie sheet with about three layers of paper towels and I'm going to drain my onion rings on them now as you can see I've added a little flour to a plastic bag I'm gonna a few my angle rings in there and I'm gonna give them a nice little shape before I add it into the batter my onion rings are holding just a little bit more batter on them and in the hot oil they go and again these are gonna fry anywhere from three to four minutes that means about one and a half to two minutes on each side before we turn these have been frying for about 4 minutes and I love the thickness of the batter now absolutely gonna be yummy and delicious so we're gonna lime over here let them drain and as soon as you get them out of the oil what you're gonna do is you're gonna add a little kosher salt to the top because if you let it cool that salt is not going to stick to those onion rings here's our crispy fried beer-battered onion rings I can't wait to try one tell you what it tastes like Wow mmm crunchy delicious sweet onion fried perfectly golden mmm little hear that Hungarian peppery kiss coming through mmm that corn starch gives it this extra delicious mmm crunch you won't be disappointed hope y'all give these a try give me a thumbs up leave me a comment I'll catch you next time
