 [Music] welcome to Japanese cooking 101 today we are gonna make miso soup let's take a look at the ingredients we have 4 cups of dashi or fish broth 1 packaged tofu 45 tbsp miso paste and 2 green onions finely chopped miso paste is a paste made from fermented soybeans used to seasoned soup sauce and other dishes there are different kinds of missile by color texture and flavor you can find me so at some grocery stores these days in the refrigerator or Asian food aisle if you have a Japanese or Asian market nearby you can certainly find more varieties or you can just order one online that she used here is Japanese fish broth and it is a key flavor factor of miso soup we explain more details in our dashi recipe video and on our website Japanese cooking 101 calm it is easy to make and very flavorful ok first we are going to cut tofu there's no right or wrong way to cut tofu but you can just slice it in half and then cut it into bite-sized pieces you can use both soft and hard kind tofu in the soup you can also use vegetables seafood and meat in miso soup instead of tofu you can make it harder by adding more stuff or make it simple like this one it's all up to you as I said before to make a good miso soup you need good dashi here's a quick recap from our dashi video all you need to do is to put a couple of handfuls of bonito flakes into boiling water and cook for a few minutes and strain it that's it it's really simple and we explain all about it in our dashi recipe video now we have four cups of dashi already made in the pot we then put the tofu in and heat it on the medium heat until the top is hot you don't need to bring it to a boiling point because tofu is delicate but just to the point that it's heated through if you are using other ingredients such as vegetables seafood and meat in miso soup you can bring it to boil and cook until everything is cooked through now we add miso paste if you have a small strainer like this it's easy to just dump missle in and dissolve miso directly in the pot if you don't have one you can just use a ladle you don't need to strain miso paste but strainer just makes it easier to stir it in the pot without breaking tofu finally you put some green onions and remove from heat looks great doesn't it miso soup is Japanese soul food and often called avocado know a gene which is a flavor of mom's home cooking we certainly love the flavor and it's a true comfort food for everyone hope you will enjoy it as much as we do [Music]
