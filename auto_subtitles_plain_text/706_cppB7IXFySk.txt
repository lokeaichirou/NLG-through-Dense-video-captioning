 hi everyone welcome back to another episode of honeysuckle catering today I'm going to show you how to make another fast and easy appetizer the potstickers who wants those frozen packaged pot stickers when you can make them fresh in no time I'm going to show you how to fill them steam them can't fry them all in one swoop let's get started you're going to need 1/2 a pound of ground pork two cups of napa cabbage leaves finely chopped two stalks of onion finely chopped about a teaspoon of ginger finely minced and then a whole shallot finely chopped as well and stuff you're filling in you're also going to need wonton wrappers I'm using these gyoza wrappers that's circular and really easy to handle you want to mince all the ingredients very finely so that when you mix it together with the ground pork it'll just come together very nicely you don't want big chunks of onions or ginger when you bite into your pot stickers to season your filling you're also going to need a tablespoon of shouting wine which is like dry sherry if you don't have this you can use a tablespoon of sake to substitute or even orange juice a tablespoon of sesame oil two tablespoons of soy sauce half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of sugar and a dash of black pepper for this recipe all you have to do is dump all of the ingredients I just listed in a huge bowl and mix it well I'm going to use my hands because it gives me more control over the mixing process now to fill your pot stickers first take a wonton wrapper and then about a teaspoon of your filling put it in the middle and then with a bit of water you're going to want to put it on the wonton wrappers on the edges this will act like glue when you pinch it together and then purse it like this you're going to create pleats that'll help hold the wontons together during the cooking process this recipe is going to make about 30 pot stickers so once you finish filling all of them take a nonstick frying pan and fill it up with about a quarter cup of water and then a teaspoon of oil now take your pot stickers and line them up in a frying pan put it on the stove on medium or medium-high heat now take a cover and put it on the frying pan for about three minutes you're going to be steaming the pot stickers at this point after three minutes of pass remove your lid and let the rest of the water evaporate once the water is evaporated you're going to be frying the pot stickers with the leftover oil from the pan fry it for two to three more minutes until the bottom is golden brown you should be able to just remove it easily and there you have it your crispy pot stickers see the bottom is nice and golden brown from the frying and the top is seen syan is fully cook now so don't worry about that so for the dipping sauce I like to make a little bit of soy sauce and sesame oil a little bit of sugar just to balance it out but you can use any kind of dipping sauce you'd like like teriyaki ponzu even sweet-and-sour would be really good too the filling came together really well you have cabbage in there which helps to keep the pork more thanks for watching another episode honeysuckle catering this is the basic recipes from potstickers and you can use actually anything that you like you can use chicken you can add mushrooms you can put in bamboo shoots the variety is endless so comment below and let me know which flavor combination you would use and to see more videos and recipes please subscribe above and please visit my facebook page for more daily updates and I'll see you guys soon bye
