 okay it's mark Wiens here in Bangkok Thailand today I'm going to make the recipe for cup pot goon which is Thai fried rice with shrimp for this fried rice recipe I'm going to be using shrimp a big green leaf of Chinese broccoli a small white onion garlic an egg and finally day-old rice but you can really substitute these ingredients for whatever you like chicken report for the meat bok choy or any kind of crisp green vegetable or mix of vegetables will work too before you get started with the fried rice the first thing to do is to make something called picnic bla which is chillies in fish sauce and it is an absolute must-have when you make Thai fried rice the first step is to add 3 tablespoons of fish sauce to a small bowl no need to measure it exactly just sort of guess it chilies again you can choose to add as many as you like I'm going to use about 5 pull off the stems and then just slice them finely and add them to the fish sauce finally to give your picnic bla sour tinge squeeze in about half a lime that's all there is to it the picnic bla and now it's ready set that aside I'm going to use about 10 small shrimp for this recipe so if you're using shrimp too the first step is to peel off the head and most of the outer shell leaving only the tail on that's the way you'll find it in Thailand garlic peel two cloves and then just coarsely mince them I'm using half of a very small sweet white onion slice it into wedges lengthwise take three or four green onions slice off the bottom roots and then cut them finely next take your Chinese broccoli or whatever green leafy vegetable you're using and cut one big leaf in half first and then slice it into one centimeter sized strips I got all of the ingredients prepped and ready to go going to light up the fire and heat up my wok but I just want to say that in order to make good cup pot you need to use rice that has actually day old rice works very well but if you take it out of the rice cooker just make sure it's cooled down and even if it rests for a couple hours that's a good idea and it will make for better fried rice because it's a little drier turn on your stove and add about one tablespoon of oil for frying make sure the oil is nice and hot before you drop in the garlic stir fry the garlic for about 15 seconds or so and then add your shrimp cook the shrimp stir frying continuously for about 30 seconds and and add half of your rice this is a little trick a little bit of rice first is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices just a few seconds later scoot your rice to one side of the wok and crack in an egg kind of world that egg around and then start to mix it up with your shrimp and rice now stir-fry until your egg looks like it's cooked all the way through then toss in the rest of your rice give it a quick stir and then add half a tablespoon of soy sauce half a tablespoon of oyster sauce and just a tiny pinch of sugar stir fry for another 15 seconds or so and then toss in your Chinese broccoli and a sliced white onion fry the rice for another 30 seconds and then toss in the green onions a few more seconds and it's ready remove it from the heat and dish it onto a plate when you order cop out in Thailand your plate will normally come with an extra wedge of lime on the side a sprinkle of pepper on top and of course that wonderful prick nabla chilies and fish sauce which is a typical condiment found on every street food table one thing is for certain when you're cooking in Bangkok you will sweat profusely but it's worth the end result so you can see this cup pot going it has a really beautiful orange e pink tinge to it and that comes from the those oils from that shrimp head I'm going to first give it another squeeze of lime to top it off love that extra hit of lime juice all over the Cal pod first step of any bite of cop pot is to take some of the picnic bla get some of those chilies going and some of the fish sauce put that on top and beautiful okay hmm oh that's delicious I love that little sour tinge from the lime juice the hit of saltiness from the picnic blah and that heat from the chili hmm just a good classic lunch dish right there so thank you so much for watching this recipe for tae cop black goo be sure to try it out and also give this video a thumbs up comment below and I'll see you on the next video okay it's mark Wiens here in Bangkok Thailand I'm gonna make the recipe for cop potty okay one thing is for certain when you're cooking in Bangkok you will wolf oh is that okay
