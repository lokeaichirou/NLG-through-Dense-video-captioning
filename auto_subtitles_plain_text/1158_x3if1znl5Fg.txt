 what's going on everybody I'm stepping away from what I normally do in my reviews on YouTube I'm actually gonna take a do something for a friend of mine who who asked me for my recipe on kimchi so I told them I would I would just make a quick youtube video about it and put it on YouTube for them so I I understand if you subscribe this could be a little bit different than what you're used to seeing first of what you're gonna need you're going to need a large head of napa cabbage that that-that-that-that napa cabbage could go buy Chinese cabbage but normally at the grocery store it's called napa cabbage you're gonna chop it up into bite-sized pieces and then you're gonna get three to four tablespoons of kosher salt or sea salt you can't use regular salt otherwise it'll kind of gum up and goop up at the top of the top of the jar when you let it set in the refrigerator for several days and so basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna put that on in layers you're gonna mix it in really well put some on put it in layers mix it up real good again then do another layer and repeat repeat that several times so you have the salt really mixed into the into the cabbage okay about an hour after you've chopped it up and you've let it set for a while you'll notice that the fluid starts coming the moisture starts coming out of the out of the napa cabbage and once about 1 to 2 cups of fluid starts to accumulate at the bottom of the bowl that's when you're going to be ready to rinse it out the cabbage will still be crisp but it'll look wilted and and become a little bit translucent if you as you rinse and drain the the cabbage you're gonna want to drain it very well the second time and try to squeeze out as much of the fluid as you can on that second try go ahead and get your green onions and your garlic ready I tend to cut the tips off of the bottom of my of my green onions they just might not be any really good reason to do this just something something I saw my mom doing as I grew up when you when you and you chop the green peppers up please PLEASE chop them into small pieces and then when you mince your garlic again just to do a very fine mince on that garlic go ahead and take all your chopped green onions and garlic and throw them in the the bowl with the cabbage in there and mix it up pretty well I also forgot to mention throw in two or three teaspoons of sugar that will aid in the fermentation as well as add to the flavor once you have everything in your bowl go ahead and grab I like to use one cup of red pepper powder or not powder but grant crush through ground red Korean red pepper and you could use different amounts just depending on what your what your tastes are there are some people that don't put any red pepper and then they make the the white kimchi but that's not what we're doing today so put put to your taste what I like to do is I put a little bit in there mix it up and then I put a little bit more in there and once you've mixed in enough red pepper powder to get to your taste I tend to let it set for another 5-10 minutes kind of stir it up one more quick time and then put it in a jar once you put it in a jar you're gonna let it set I like to let it set out for a day or two at room temperature not outside and in my kitchen or somewhere like that before putting it in the refrigerator I'm really it's just like just like sauerkraut the longer longer you let it set out and ferment that it's gonna have more of a sour taste every time I think it's more common that people let it sit out three to five days and really the benefit for this is there's some incredible probiotics and that are just extremely healthy and good for you should google it and read about the probiotic benefits of eating kimchi it's just one of the super foods it's just tremendously helpful for you healthy for you again that that's really it this is about how much one one head of cabbage made and one head of napa cabbage made made him at a jar and a half of of kimchi and again I made this made this video for one of my friends who who asked me for my kimchi recipe and so I'm not one of those people that really have precise measurements as you can kind of see in my video I just kind of throw it in there and kind of kind of taste so I appreciate you checking out this video please like it if you liked it that helps other people helps it helped me helps people find the video gives me gives me a better ranking thank you very much and have a good day
