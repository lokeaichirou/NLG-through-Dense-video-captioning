 okay so today we're going to make a you know fish and chips with one of my favorite fish cold the first thing we need to do is to get the chips on you want to simmer them for about five minutes and then drain them let them cool naturally in the air before we fry them the best thing to do is to do that a couple of hours before so I just think it's nice oh a nice dry chip before you put it into the fryer you get a lovely crispy finish so put the potatoes into the water cold water the reason for that if you put them into hot boiling water so you end up all the potatoes breaking and still raw in the center and we want them cooked right through the next thing we're going to do is make the tartar sauce and the first thing you need to do is to make a classic mayonnaise now a mayonnaise there are emulsion so basically it means you're a most fine egg yolk with acid and with oil you know and you have to make sure you do it slowly at first otherwise you will split the ingredients so if anything you just split your eggs they all go there there is free egg yolks and we need to take our English mustard and a couple of dashes of white wine vinegar obviously whisking by hand it's quite an arduous job so to help you the best thing to do is to get what a wet tea towel and form yourself a little circle and then hold the bowl in in place so that gives you a free hand to put your oil in so slowly we add the oil a few drops at a time if you were to split it maybe you take the split ingredients get a fresh egg yolk and put it into a new bowl add a little dash of vinegar and then start the whole process again adding this mixture and your will have success of a freshly emulsified mayonnaise so that's all the oil incorporated what you're looking for is consistency a very fit custard if you'd like it a little bit thicker get more oil if you like it a little bit obviously looser you just add less oil so once you've got your mayonnaise made and you got it to the consistency you like next thing we need to do is chop the capers and the gherkins and then get the herbs in there which is a tarragon chervil the Parsee and the chives your night all them into the mayonnaise sometimes when you add the ingredients to the mayonnaise the vinegar will let the mayonnaise down so you may have to add a little bit more oil to it okay so at this point when you said our seasoning our salt and pepper so most important part is to taste the tartar sauce if you're happy with it get it in the fridge until we finish cooking so whilst you're making yourself sauce keep an eye on your chips when you insert a knife it's just a little bit soft but you still want a little bit firmness there as well when you go to that stage it's after about six minutes you're going to take them off drain them and put them onto a tray to cool down next thing is the beer batter so we've got our flour we've got some sugar we've got some fresh yeast also got some doom bar beer which is my one of my favorites and you can use slugger you could use any other beer but you know do bars for me so first thing you do is add the flour and sugar then we got crumbling our fresh yeast and then gently we add the beer then what you're after is a nice smooth batter if you added all the beer at once you wouldn't get a chance to make a paste first see you're after a paste before you add it or well boys you hear that with lumps okay so finally we had a little bit of salt a touch of pepper then we cover that with a tea towel and leave it for 10 minutes before we cook with it the reason why I like COD for fish and chips is has lovely white flaky pearly sort of flesh and it works very very well fish and chips okay so this is how you may get your Fisher in the fish mongers so this stage you will still have the skin on it you'll still have a few pin bones in there these pin bones you really want to remove because they will get stuck in your throat so an easy way to do that it's not just Rumble with a pair of pliers is actually to cut them out and with fish and chips that's perfectly acceptable and to skin it I'll just show you now the easiest way it's just to come along the center where the where the bones are right so as you can see you still got the skin on there what you've got is something workable so life in at the end to this skin and there you have the skin at the bottom and all you need to do is firmly hold onto the big weight where you've cut don't move it and use the sharp knife to come all the way along the Phillip alright so then what you've got is a lovely glowing of cod which you're now compulsion the efficient chips so the bottom side which is the belly of the Philip just year to remove all this so once I can sing you is the actual inside of the belly which it's not very nice to eat so we remove that and then the photos are still in there so we just need to find where the bones are usually you sharp knife come along the center again just cutting them bones out and then the same is with you before just cutting at the bottom bring your knife along holding onto the skin and let the knife do the work you go for nice pieces out of one Philip the efficient chips all those trimmings you've got left over go throw em away stick them in the freezer when you've got enough make yourself a lovely fish pie okay so we've got my fish ready so the first thing you do is to get your chips into the fryer if you want to get in colored off first I've always you're going to be struggling for removing your deep fat fryer is the fryer is hot 180 degrees now will seal them off for about to a full minute so they can start to color up before we take them out let them cool slightly while we put the fish in to watch the chips are cooking for four minutes we'll get on with the cut please take our backup which has been resting for about ten minutes and then we'll get some flour it will be the salt in there it's such a pepper and then just pass your Cod fill it through the flour knock off any excess you don't want any layers of raw flour in there and then into the batter okay so the chips have been covering up now for about four minutes till take them out of it and drain and now you put the code in leave the cot in there for about sort of two minutes and then we'll turn them over and cook it for an hour three or four minutes before we add the chips back in and then hope you all come up with something nice and golden-brown the Cod's about three or four minutes away now so I'm grab the chips back in just to finish them off okay so if you haven't got a deep fat fryer you simply just breadcrumb the fish put it through some flour egg and bread crumbs and then shallow fry it in a hot pan and you get roughly the same result but yo he's worth getting a deep fat fire because fish and chips is all about the deep fat fryer first so you do that a little bit of salt drain of our peas where's your lemon our Cod beautiful crispy chips our peas and then lovely thick tartar sauce and there you have it that's my Colin chips with tartar sauce and fresh Peas
