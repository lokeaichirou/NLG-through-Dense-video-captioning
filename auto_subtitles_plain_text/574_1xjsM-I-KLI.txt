 there's nothing like a bowl of hot soup to warm your soul hi I'm Karen Ahmed and welcome to another episode of cravings log today we're making my all-time favorite soup hot and sour let's start with the stop we're going to need 2 litres of stop now this can be your homemade stock you can get it out of a can or package or you can use these little stock cubes I'm going to use the stock cubes today and I've used 2 cubes per liter I'm going to bring this to a boil now if you're feeling a little bit guilty because you haven't made your own homemade stock don't worry just take all off the leftover bits and pieces from all the vegetables that you cut and just throw it in the stock and let it simmer let's talk about all of the ingredients in the soup we have so many ingredients and each one adds to the layers of complexity of flavors in this soup I'm going to start with minced ginger and garlic now finely minced this as fine as I could and I know you're looking at me and saying you know what's the what's the alternative there is none suck it up cut up some fresh ginger and garlic you can substitute the burst of flavor that you're going to get into the soup don't use bottled ginger and garlic it's not going to work next I've also chopped up some spring onions I've chopped up about 12 bulbs and and then I'm going to saute some ground chicken I've got about half a pound of ground chicken and the ground chicken is just going to soak up all the flavors like a sponge next I'm going to add about 5 tablespoons of ground chili sauce or sambal Olek now while this might seem a lot remember we're using 2 litres of liquid so the five chili spoons of chilli sauce isn't going to be too spicy at all and I'm also going to add a tablespoon of ground pepper I've also got half a cup of fresh mushrooms I've just chopped it up really fine I'm going to give it a quick saute then we're going to add the stock that's been simmering back into the pot and I'm going to follow it with some canned shiitake or you can even use the dried version just soak it up in some hot water cut it up and add it to the flavor these mushrooms given an amazing flavor to the suits I'm going to follow that with my secret ingredient which is chopped up coriander stems not the leaves the stems now while you're thinking she's using stems most people just throw these stems away but they have got a ridiculous amount of flavor in them now chop them up just like you would chop up chives or any one of those herbs and just chop it up really fine and add it into your soup once all that's in I'm going to add in some julienne of carrots bamboo shoots and some firm tofu that I cut up and I'm going to flavor it with some dark soya sauce rice wine vinegar and I'm going to thicken it up just a little bit I've got a slurry of cornstarch just about two tablespoons of cornstarch I don't want the soup to be really gloopy you see sometimes in restaurants when you have the soup overnight in your fridge and you look at it the next morning just looks like a big lump of gloop I don't want that and then I'm going to add in some egg and I'm just going to use a fork and stir it around just so you get this beautiful little egg ribbon and finally at the end we're just going to add in some fresh coriander leaves that have been chopped up and some spring onion leaves that I've reserved and we're just going to add that in at the end as a garnish so let's get started let's saute four tablespoons of minced ginger and garlic in a couple of tablespoons of oil next let's add some spring onions I have about 12 balls and have only chopped up the white parts I'm going to add half a pound of brown chicken just break it up with the back of your spoon and squish it down so there's no lumps once the chicken is cooked we're ready to add the hot in hot and sour soup five tablespoons of brown chili paste or sambal oelek now like I mentioned before this chicken is going to soak up all the flavors just like a sponge we're also going to add a tablespoon of black ground pepper add half a cup of fresh mushrooms and give it a quick saute and we're ready to add the rest of the stock I've got two liters of stock that's been boiling away I'm ready to strain that right into the mixture and once that's done I'm going to take all the additional vegetables and discard them give the soup a really really good stir and after that's done we're just going to bring this to a boil once this comes to a boil let's add about 300 ml of canned shiitake mushrooms and then my secret ingredient coriander stalks I've got 2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander stalks this adds an amazing flavor add 1 carrot that's cut in julienne four tablespoons of canned bamboo shoots that's also cut in julienne and finally some tofu that's cut in julienne as well give this a good stir and then add in 3 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar and 3 tablespoons of dark soya sauce next we're going to add a simple cornstarch slurry to thicken the soup 2 tablespoons of cornstarch just mixed in with some water just added right into the soup and finally garnish with a photo cup each of chopped coriander and chopped spring onion leaves the hot and sour is ready I wish you could smell this it smells absolutely delicious and it's got layer upon layer upon layer of delicious flavors now if you want to make a vegetarian version of this dish all you need to do is use vegetable stock instead and don't use any egg or chicken and you can achieve the same kind of flavor thank you so much for joining me see you next time on cravings blogs
