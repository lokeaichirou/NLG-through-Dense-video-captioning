 hi this is Brian shizer from trellis at the Heathman hotel in Kirkland Washington and we're here to show you how to make a juicy hamburger out of lean ground beef we're going to start off today with ground sirloin and this is a special grind and in order to have a juicy hamburger we want a certain fat content so we're looking for about eight to ten percent fat and that means we're going about 90 to 92 percent lean now we've asked our butcher to grind this for us so it's already pre ground and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add into this a little bit of saut√©ed red onion a little bit of sauteed celery and some fresh herbs and that is going to help us create a nice juicy burger I want to put a touch of pepper not too much salt just a little bit of salt now the celery and the onion been pre sauteed a little bit what they're going to do is when we cook our burger slowly they're going to bring some juice and they're also going to help keep it nice and lean so I'm going to put a pair of gloves on one of the most important things when making burgers are handling ground meat is that you want to have your work surface clean and sanitized make sure that your cutting board running through the dishwasher all your tencel's are nice and clean and I'll show you a little trick when we form it just a ziploc bag or a little piece of plastic works great for keeping all those things off your counter so I'm going to mix our celery and our onion in with our ground beef so I'm making we want to mix this really well we're going to form this into four patties and we're going to make sure everything is mixed in nice if you want all your patties to be the same little trick is to have a scale you can set your scale for the ounces that you want a six ounce burger seven ounce burger eight ounce burger and then for forming our burgers so they're all the same we use a ring and this actually this ring makes a perfect six ounce burger and I'm just going to set that on top of our plastic wrap put my ground beef in the center just put a touch more on top there we want to fill it right to the top take and turn that over put our burger out this is an 8 ounce burgers this is a pretty hefty burger it is delicious when grilled and makes a great sandwich for two another little trick we can do here so we want to make a couple of small burgers for the kids just take a little bit make a couple little tiny burgers here now remember when you're getting ready to cook your burgers you then again wanna season them with a little salt and I like to season high up that way there it's evenly distributed over the top of the burgers so we don't have a lot of salt in one spot put a little bit of pepper and this is how to make a juicy hamburger with lean ground beef again this is brian from trellis at the Heathman hotel in Kirkland you
