 hey everybody welcome to the Wolfe pit today I'm gonna make an Italian classic chicken parmesan but I'm gonna do it on the grill so there's no breading and no frying just lots of flavor it's simple it's easy and it's delicious so let's get started I'm gonna start by seasoning my chicken and today I'm using some boneless skinless chicken breast you can use bone-in chicken or boneless skinless chicken thighs whatever kind of chicken will work in this recipe I'm going to drizzle with extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper Italian seasoning granulated garlic granulated onion and some crushed red pepper flakes now flip over and season the other side once they're all season place them in the refrigerator for about an hour to marinate and today I'm going to be using my Napoleon 485 Mirage gas grill the Napoleon barrage 485 stainless steel gas grill has five burners for a total of 74 thousand BTUs that's three main burners one rear infrared burner four rotisserie cooking and one infrared sizzle zone side burner this gives you 815 square inches of total cooking area and there's some other features that really stand out to me one is the integrated cooler to where you can keep your condiments and drinks cold as well as an integrating cutting board and then you have the I Glo backlight technology how many times have you been grilling at night fiddling with a flashlight trying to see where your temperature set now all you have to do is hit a button and your knobs illuminate now let's go ahead and get the main burners lit one two and three and the infrared sizzle zone side burner to heat up some tomato sauce once the grill is preheated to 350 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and sear the chicken off for about three to four minutes per side after about five minutes our tomato sauce has come up to a simmer and now I'm going to transfer it over to a pan to finish cooking the chicken in after about three minutes I'm gonna go ahead and flip the chicken once it's got some nice color to it in that for about six minutes or so and it's got some nice color on both sides I'm gonna go ahead and transfer the chicken breast over into the sauce once all the chicken is in the pan I'm gonna move the pan to the center of the grill turn the center burner off and leave the two outside burners on low I'm gonna close the lid and cook this uncovered for about 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through you do not want to overcook the chicken after cooking for another 20 minutes on low our chicken and sauce are done the chicken is beautiful it smells amazing the sauce is thickened up a little now let's get this plated up and there you have it grilled chicken parmesan without all the breading fat and calories but with all the flavor serve over top of a bed of spaghetti topped with lots and lots of Parmesan cheese and enjoy if this looks like something you'd like to try at home please give me a thumbs up thank you all very much for watching I hope you give this a try and I'll see you next time you
