 Sarah Hopkins you might have seen some of my previous videos and today what I want to do is share one of my favorite recipes and in my opinion one of the most healthiest and beneficial recipes around so you may have heard about fermented foods they seem to be a bit of a trending topic at the moment and that's because most of us have a pretty poorly sort of run digestive system due to excessive alcohol consumption coffee consumption and antibiotics especially so what fermented foods do is really really popular the gut so really allow they got to heal and allow the right population of healthy gut flora to repopulate that gut again and to get things working sauerkraut is a really simple recipe to make so I thought that that would be a great one to start with because it's really easy everybody can do it it's also super cost effective you can buy sauerkraut but it's quite expensive all it takes is a cabbage and some salt so I'll take you through the process today and hopefully you can incorporate this into your diet on a daily basis so the first thing that we need is a cabbage always has to be organic organic is really important foods that are not organic when they ferment they're basically sort of increasing that toxicity of whatever the pesticides are that are present on the food so organic is really important which is obviously going to cost a little bit more but it's a worthwhile investment for your health so a cabbage a good-quality fermenting jar is important and the one that I've got here is called a Fowler's the cola you can use like the the clip lock jars but I would recommend looking into a Fowler's for Cola good quality sea salt so again it's really important to get a good quality naturally sourced sea salt we don't want any refined salts they're not going to allow the fermentation process to occur adequately then you just want some seasoning so the seasoning I'm going to use today is caraway seeds juniper berries and some dill tips and we'll we'll have a look so what we're going to do is we're going to start with chopping the cabbage finely and by the way be careful with the knife otherwise you'll cut yourself like I did so I find the best way to chop the cabbage shown to me by a good friend very recently is into quarters and then it's easy to get that core out there we go so then we're going to chop the cabbage you can use a mandolin to do this it does make it easier so you want to you want to chop it relatively finely watching out for those fingers so hopefully you can see from this roughly how finely you want it to chop so we've got the whole cabbage finely chopped into a nice big bowl bowl needs to be a fairly good size and then we want to add the salt so the salt is going to help release the brine which is going to allow the lacto-fermentation process which is providing all that beautiful bacteria that is going to heal ogre so the rule of thumb with salt is that you want about 2.5 to 3 percent of the weight of the cabbage so in this case we've got about 20 grams so I've weighed that out I'm going to add that in then I'm going to add my spices or seasonings in so probably for this cabbage which was about 800 ish grams I'm going to use about a teaspoon and then I'm using probably about a teaspoon of juniper berries well you'll steal tips still can be quite strong so maybe half a teaspoon I do have some fresh dill in the garden if you do have fresh dill I would recommend using that now for the fun part what you want to do is we really need to release all of the juices from this cabbage because they're really making you know the core sort of constituents of this whole fermentation process so it's called a brine so now we're going to get in really mix that salt into the cabbage which is going to take about ten minutes so really work it it's a good workout you really want to squeeze that cabbage I like to call it mastication because you it's like you're using your hands to chew the cabbage with mastication is chewing so you're really masticating that cabbage to really release all that see all that beautiful brine so that's all of that Brian that's the sort of sugar and starch containing the vegetable that will allow the fermentation process to occur so now it's sort of it takes probably about ten minutes for it to really get to this level of brine enos and you can see that it's really soft and briny and all those herbs that are blended in and the most important thing that you put in there is love so make sure that you you know give it lots of love and really massage massage all of your goodness into it and now we're going to place it into our fermenting jar which I am a little bit uncoordinated at but that's okay so this is also sort of part of the important and important part of the process so we need to make sure that we're packing that cabbage in really really tight because the cabbage needs to be entirely covered by Brian for the fermentation process to occur in the best possible environment so really really punching it down and we've got lots of Brian in the bottom here so it's gonna be really well covered and obviously it's important to wash your hands before you do this that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do but just to make sure that you're getting the right bacteria in there and not anything else that you might have been touching and if you are squeamish about that you can use some rubber gloves I've obviously got a rubber finger for where I've cut myself but you can use you know well fitting rubber gloves but I think you know there's something to be said for really getting in contact with and having some personal connection back to our food which again is really sort of playing into that whole paleo piece you know it's about getting back to our natural roots and our ancestors always fermented food and they always use their fingers and hands to eat and and touch and prepare their food and so I personally think that using your hands is the best way to prepare a really good healthy robust sauerkraut okay so we've got lots of beautiful brine and we're going to push that down so that it covers I'm gonna really jam it in so that it's nice and tight and actually that's probably the right height you want to leave a little bit of room because when it starts to ferment it can actually start to bubble as you can see here there is a little bit of bubbling going on so you want to make sure that you do have about that width between the sort of the top of the brine and then the lid so now we're going to place the lid on so this particular fermenting jar and all good fermenting jars should be creating an anaerobic environment so no oxygen that's that's the idea so with this particular Jar make sure that the rubber band is fitted correctly around the outside and then pop that leads on it and I like to line it up with the line that's on the top of the lead and there you have it beautiful amazingly healthy jar of sauerkraut which is amazing for a healthy gut flora and also tastes absolutely delicious so I'm gonna leave that now in a dark place so probably in my pantry for up to four weeks in this particular jar so I'll probably leave this for somewhere between two to four weeks to really allow the optimal fermentation process to occur and after that it can be popped into the fridge or popped into another jar and enjoyed you know as a condiment once a day or twice a day if you feel like it to really help reconstitute the gut flora and improve your health for this recipe and many more head to my blog
