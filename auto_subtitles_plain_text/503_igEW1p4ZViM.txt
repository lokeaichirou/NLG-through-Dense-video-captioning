 I'm going to show you a recipe for the most fantastic cottage pie you're gonna absolutely love it it's full of veggies super healthy not only will the kids enjoy it it'll be really good for them soon over here I've got potatoes and pass them both cut up together and I'm gonna stick that in some boiling water okay so not just potatoes there's a mix of potatoes and pasta well that comes up to the boil which is going to be our topping for the pie I'm gonna prepare the filling so into a really hot pan I've got some beef mince I'm gonna go ahead and spread that in now you can hear how hot the pan was okay so I'm just gonna break that out once your beef has had a couple of minutes to get nice and brown what you do is you take it out we're gonna strain it and then take a little bit of the fat off it you've hands back onto the heat we're gonna let the heat go up up in there again until it's nice and hot and take my onions with my garlic my time good stir I have a whole lot of butternut pumpkin and I also have some carrots so we're going to add this now to the onions and that's going to cook down so the pies got plenty of veggies both inside and in the crust right so once you carrot some pumpkin have had about five minutes to start sweating down and soften up a little bit I've got some tomato paste here and what this is gonna do is bring a real richness to my pie so throw that in and it's important that you sort of cook this out a little bit before you add your beef stock okay what you're gonna do is you're gonna roast for that it's gonna take a little bit of that natural bitterness that is in that tomato face so get that big girl stir I love this dish is so special to me my mum used to make a beautiful Shipman spine and I could always remember when I walk into her house and I'd smell that she'd been cooking now I was so happy and I still am today would I make it myself so once your tomato paste is roasted out just for a minute or two and you know that that you can sort of see it starting to stick to the pan a little bit just how you want it the next thing you do is grab your beef stock add that to your pan and then add your beef back in if you pull that off without just dumping it all in you'll see what juice is left now if it's very oily you might want to discard it if it's not too bad you might be happy just to add it back in there's not too much oil on that so I'm gonna pull the whole thing back into there's lots of flavor there right so now that you've got your beef and your beef broth back in there you want to get yourself a lid and cover it you're going to simmer it so you can turn it down just a little for about 15 to 20 minutes so our beef and vegetable mix has got about 10 15 minutes to go well our potatoes and parsnips are now done so I'm gonna turn those off strain the water look at that back up so while their potatoes and parsnips are steaming dry here I have just a little butter and some milk in a sauce but I'm gonna warm that up and these go ahead and add all of your veg back into the pan now if you want to do something fancy like they do in restaurants you can get one of these food Rice's push-ups frugal become really smooth and perfect and that's how I love to do my mashed potato I'm serving it with a steak or something like that but for a dish like this a couple of pumps are absolutely fine so I'm going for the old conventional potato masher just get in there and give a quick old knock up together right so once you've given that a good old mash up let's season it plenty of salt and then grab that milk and butter but now I'm just gonna slowly add that okay a little bit of elbow grease a little taste oh yeah tiny bit more salt you'll notice I see to the top so because I don't want those little flakes of pepper in there if I season the base with lots of pepper let's have a look at it look at that delicious and rich beautiful so just a little bit of salt in there and then plan your pepper rights we are so once this has a beautiful consistency make sure you have a taste fantastic so over here I'm going to pull up my four little dishes and literally just come on over spoon this straining divider even between two core ramekins or dishes so the next thing we do is get our mashed potato and parsnip and you just sort of add that for the top of each of our pie dishes now of course you can do this so many different ways you get a piping bag advantage I put in and make it look all fancy we get super rustic you can make it nicely smooth this is the way I like to do what I do so I just get it a little bit on top of each one and then I don't mind of just pushing around spread it out like that I quite like it when there's a little bit of texture so I actually just go over the top then dig a little crispy bits of potato which I just love brush with just a little melted butter the beautiful thing about making products price or Shepherd's pies for that matter is you can make them up in a batch you might only want to serve one or two tonight and then you can pop the others in the fridge the perfect meal so if your family comes home at different times okay I'm gonna pop these in the oven 190 degrees for about 15 to 20 they're so delicious I love it when those potatoes get so delicious and crispy like that because you put all that tomato paste into the actual base of the play you really don't need to serve with tomato sauce as a kid I used to love ellipse mother so I'm not gonna lie but I think these runs just fine as they are piping hot
