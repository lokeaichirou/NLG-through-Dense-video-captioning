 [Music] hi I'm rockin Robin from cooking Mexican recipes calm and today I'm making soft tacos now one of the nice things about soft tacos is that when you bite into it a lot of times what will happen if you have a hard shell is it'll crack and all your ingredients fall over the plate well with soft tacos that doesn't happen so that's what we're gonna make today so for this recipe we're going to use a pound and a half of ground beef I have one yellow onion finely chopped I have one cup of tomato sauce 3 tablespoons of oregano leaves two and a quarter teaspoons of ground cumin I have three cloves of minced garlic and a teaspoon and a half of salt we're gonna start with three tablespoons of oil in the frying pan now my recipe calls for a vegetable ill but today I'm using olive oil and that works just fine too I'm going to place my onion into the frying pan I'm going to saute the onions for four to five minutes until they become translucent the onions are soft now so now I'm going to add the ground beef [Music] all right so now I'm going to add some salt we're gonna cook this until the muse done the ground beef is just now finished and there's a little excess oil in there so I'm going to drain that out okay so now I'm gonna add my minced garlic we're gonna saute the garlic for another three minutes to bring out the flavor okay now we're ready to add the last three ingredients our tomato sauce our oregano and our ground cumin get it all mixed in and cook it for about five minutes and they'll be ready to go for our tacos our meat has been simmering now for five to ten minutes and it's ready to go all all the flavors have melded together and it's it's very tasty and now we're waiting for the oil I'm gonna start showing you how to do the soft taco portion of this recipe so in order to make our soft taco shells I've got about a quarter now maybe a half a cup of olive oil in my frying pan heating it up over medium heat so I'm gonna take a tortilla a piece of one and see how it's bubbling up that's what I'm looking for so my oil is hot enough and ready to go so I've got a couple of tortillas here with some tongs I'm going to dip them in the torque in the oil you can hear it sizzling up a little bit I want to make sure that the oil gets on both of the tortillas I'm gonna let them cook just a little bit so they firm up and take them out draining a little bit and put it on paper towels put another paper towel on top to kind of absorb the oil turn this one over or Pat it now we're ready for our ingredients okay I've dipped my tortillas in the oil so now they're softened and now I'm going to put all the ingredients inside and make our tacos we've got the ground beef of course I've got some lettuce we've got some grated up cheddar cheese I've got some sliced avocado tomato sour cream and some salsa take the tortilla and I'm gonna place it on my plate and I'm gonna add some ground beef tomato sprinkle with cheese slice of avocado a little bit of salsa and when we close it up sometimes they don't want to stay but the sour cream really helps to almost act like a glue and holds it together if you need a little extra help you can stick a toothpick in there there we go to soft beef tacos so that's how you make beef soft tacos I hope that helps you and be sure and stop by my website at cooking Mexican recipes comm for more recipes you can cook at home and remember it's got to be hot to be good [Music]
