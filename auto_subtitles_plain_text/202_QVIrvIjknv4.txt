 hey guys so now I'm going to show you how to make kimchi it's pretty easy recipe just takes kind of a lot of cutting I'll list the ingredients in the infobox and so we'll get started so the first thing you need is to Napa cabbages so here's one of them and what you want to do is you know after you wash it just cut it into fourths so what I do is I actually just cut it in half cut it in half and then just cut it in half again okay so then which one I do is just make sure you cut off the hard part down here you don't want to eat you ought to be eating that so make sure you just cut that off and then all you need to do to cut these into pieces is just take your quarter and then just make little about one inch one inch slices good next you want to do is get one cup of salt you're going to put this into a container with ten cups of hot water and you want to dissolve the salt and basically what you're going to do is you're going to put this into the all the cabbage you've cut up and you're going to soak it you're going to soak it in salt water for about two hours so I've got my ten cups of water in the salt one cup of salt all dissolved in here and so what I'm going to do is just dump it into the Kinch into the cabbage basically what this is going to do is it's going to draw out all the water from the cabbage so basically you're going to let this sit for about two hours make sure during the two hours that you you know move the cabbage around you want to make sure that everything gets mixed do that maybe like four times during the two hours the next ingredient is one clove of garlic so this is one clove of garlic all minced up after this you want to take your half onion and mince that up as well so again like the garlic this is the half onion and it's all chopped up so as you can see it's nice and chopped up okay so the next thing you want to do is basically take a piece of ginger probably about about this much so about this much a ginger and mince this up as well next take eight stalks of green onions and basically just want to chop these up so just going to chop these up into small little pieces the last solid ingredient is the radish usually usually they're actually bigger but I just buy a smaller one that way I can throw the whole thing in there so what you want to do is skin it first and then what I do is like cut it in half it's kind of a crooked half but have to do so cut it in half first and what you want to do is you're going to make these into strips so you want to cut them cut them into little chunks like this I like that remember like that and then just you can actually just stack them too if you want and try to make the trying to make these strips pretty thin cause we're going to be doing these with the cabbage so do you want them too ridiculously big no strip like this this is about a good size so if you've cut up in chopped and minced all your ingredients what you want to do is take tablespoon and you want to do four tablespoons of sugar someone and you want seven tablespoons of fish sauce 1/2 and the final ingredient is of course the red chili pepper you know like is it that it's famous color so the recipe actually calls for one one two quarter cups but my family's kind of weak sauce so we don't do anywhere near that so I'm going to do about I'm going to do about like a quarter of a cup okay and also you can also just test it as well so if it's not hot enough for you once you put all the kimchi you know all the cabbage and all this stuff together you can just add more of the paste if you want so basically you can just do what you're liking so after you add all that stuff then of course you want to mix everything together and it should kind of be like a like a paste okay so if it's not it's not Pacey you want to add a little bit more water to make it a little bit more pasty and the final thing you want to do is take your kimchi take the cabbage out of the container and wash it three times and then want to do is just put it back into your huge container okay and last thing you want to do is take your your big pace that you made and of course dump that thing into the bowl as well into the big container okay all you need to do is just mix it together so the last thing you want to do is mix it all together so I just use a plastic bag give a glove it'll work too and then just basically mix all this together and of course if you want to ferment it what I would do is put it into packing into jars really tightly so there's no air and then leave it room temperature overnight and then you can store it in the refrigerator or if you want to just eat it right now it's ready to go so I'll help this tutorial helped too and happy cooking
