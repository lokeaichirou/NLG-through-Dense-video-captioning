 okay I'm originally from Sheboygan Wisconsin and that happens to be ground zero for bratwurst period I believe the correct method for making brats is genetically imprinted on my DNA so this is not just my opinion it's science so we start with the brats now there are thousands of types some are good most aren't first thing do not get precooked brats you can find good ones if you're lucky locally but Johnsonville brats are available all over the US they're made in Sheboygan and they're excellent another thing is the roll a few bakeries in the Sheboygan area make the perfect hard roll these are not readily available and an acceptable substitute is a Kaiser bun I suggest staying away from the white bread Pam burger buns and those things called brought buns because those are just hot dog buns anyway if you can't find a real hard roll go for the Kaiser bun now to cook them charcoal is recommended but a gas grill will do whatever you do don't close the cover you need the brats of course tongs a squirt bottle and a beverage remember this is man land so something you do not need is your swallows telling you how to do it so you want your fire one coal deep not terribly hot maybe six or eight inches below the grate and on they go oh one thing do not pre cook these in any way we don't boil them first nothing they go raw right onto the grill I mean you don't blow your steak before you're thrown on the grill do you because they're uncovered you'll occasionally get a flare-up that's what the squirt bottle is for now these are looking good now this one's not quite ready to turn with the right fire we want to do about five minutes per side all four sides about 20 minutes total let me tell you there is nothing like the smell of broad smoke on a summer afternoon when they're all nice and dark brown they're ready to come off and it's time for the next step okay now we're going to simmer them in beer for a little while now you don't need your expensive micro brewery in port for this just about anything will do you can also put a little butter in here and some people even cut up onions and put those in too but remember we're going to simmer not boil if you did this right they're already cooked as I said earlier hard rolls are hard to find but here's what one looks like now we put a little butter on the Roll and for me a slice Iranian and it is ready to go I guess ketchup and mustard and sauerkraut are okay but I usually only use that stuff at the company picnic when they're making precooked using your brats or something like that you know just to cover up the taste oh and it's also best to eat them outside if at all possible and there you have it you
