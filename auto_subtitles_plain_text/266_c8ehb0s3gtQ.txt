 the Kentucky Beef Council and Kentucky living magazine proudly present executive chef dr. Michael rigs for the lean beef cooking demo good evening everybody doing good okay you're off to good starts all I got to do is keep the pace going all right okay what Alison referred to is that we are going to do a dish called beef burgundy on now if you're in Paris or France you call it booth and I made a mistake a couple years in Paris calling a beef burger in yewland I got some really bad looks from the waiter so I've worked on that over the years but beef Bergen young is a peasant dish his history comes from the Burgundy region of France and just like in America it comes from the concept of one pot cooking so the whole idea of that as these dishes were created by cooking what was available at the time by the people what they had no most to them one of the things we talked about in culinary world is what grows together goes together so if you're in a part of the world where they have beef and the Burgundy region of France is also known for its mushrooms and its cheeses and its wines as well it would make sense to use those ingredients to create this dish so it was a way of taking beef and cooking it for extended period of time in burgundy wine I have a sign above my kitchen that says I like cooking with wine sometimes I even put it in the food so we're going to start by saut√©ing some bacon it can't go wrong whether you're in France or whether you're in Bowling Green Bacon's bacon okay so we're going to saute that one of the things we're doing we saute as we heat our pan first the reason you want to heat the pan first is you don't want to put food into a cold skillet you want the skillet already be hot so we're going to render the fat off of this which basically means we're going to cook it a little bit and then we're going to get it where we get the grease off of it then what we're going to do is when that's done I'll pull that out and I will remove all the fat the grease and I'm not going to throw it away don't worry I'm going to use it okay it goes back into the dish so basically just warming this up now the beef I've got is Kentucky proud because when I Bob meat for our program i use a butcher on the bypass called the fatted calf Ryan does a tremendous job when he does that and he uses all Kentucky proud products he tries his best to get only meat from Kentucky if you can so I appreciate that kind of working with him on that so that's where I get in mine so we're going to pull this out this wasn't dinner I'd be looking for some breakfast right now someone put that back in it now I'm going to save that at the same time now we're going to take our beef which is lean beef because we don't want a lot of fat content we got into fat with the bacon kind of got that covered so we're going to take that and we're going to lightly coat that and flour and the reason when I cut that flower is that's going to keep it from sticking to the pan sauce is going to help sear in the beef now what happens when we put this back in and this is where I add the bacon fat backing this is the good part is that that's going to start to stick to the bottom of the pan in a few minutes once this just gets slightly Brown I'm not going to cook this all the way because part of the process of making a good stew for those you like to make them is a long slow simmer right got to put it in a bra so once we Brown this I'm going to pull it back out and put a little salt and pepper on it at that point because I want to flavor it but I don't want the salt and pepper to burn out while it's being brown I want to flavor it when I bring you back out so we're going to move that around a little bit now all the good stuff that's left in the bottom of the pan when you're done makes really good what the French call fond it will be in the South call gravy okay that's the good stuff so we don't want to cook this long because it's going to cook following a recipe the first amount of time it cooks is a solid hour when it's all submerged in this red wine that has garlic and tomato paste and margarine and all that kind of stuff that makes you wish you would cook faster but a good stew you have to cook the meat slow because you don't want to overcook it you really want to be very tender you really want that taste so I'm gonna pull that out and I'm going to sprinkle that with a little salt and pepper without salt basically you not gonna taste anything else the salt gives everything a kick that's what gets the start that's why you find salt in all kinds of recipes okay so here's the bacon fat we've been waiting for so we're going to put that back in there and I'm going to start adding all the good stuff once you get everything started this is a really simple dish okay this is the best part right here now I'm going to add that tomato paste and this is just steam coming off of there still hot weather it's Justine so that was kind of hot a little marjoram in there and we're going to let that cook so we've got tomato paste that's mixed in with this burgundy wine that's got bacon and bacon fat sounds kind of help me then start with lean beef so we got the least lean beef then cover okay that what i'm going to do is I'm going to add baby carrots and I'm going to add in pearl onions you can buy them this way okay think about working on the farm anywhere in the country that you got root vegetables everybody plants the garden so these things are really available on a regular basis so we're going to let those cook for a while okay and what we're doing is that we're putting the root vegetables in first because they take the longest to cook once this is all cooking then basically I set it on the side put the top in about an hour later I'm going to come back okay it's going to thicken up because that flower is now going to mix in with with the wine and all the other flavors and that starts to create that thick sauce because we use flour and culinary business to create what we call a roux which is the thickening agent at this point activist is cooked for an hour and i'm doing the fast-forward thing here right case magics ben and i are y'all been sitting around watching whatever julia child's cooking okay and so I'm going to come back and right before it's done you can smell that then I add the mushrooms the mushrooms not going to take about 10 or 15 minutes now I want to put a lid on this because it's a stew and I want to trap that heat okay it smells pretty good right here that and this is the five minute version versus the two hour so from beginning to end it's about an hour and 45 minutes maybe two hours and the thing about a good Bergen your own is if you have a glass of burger nina and a loaf of hard french bread you're good to go because you can bite on the steak and chop up the gravy as where I grew up in Carolina that's what you did you stop it up I hope you enjoyed your booth bergen young you
