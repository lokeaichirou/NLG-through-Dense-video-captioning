 hey welcome back to a barbecue right today I'm going to show you how to make one of my favourite hot dogs and it's the Chicago doll I ordered some of these hot dogs straight from Vienna from Chicago they even sent me the bright green pickle relish sport peppers even the celery salt to go with them you can see here and today we're going to get them out on the grill because in Chicago they do hot dogs a couple ways you can either steam them or Bowl them in some water or you guys few places that's actually thrown them on the grill and create what they call the Chicago char dog and that's the one that I'm going for which is you got that flavor from the charcoal from the smoke gets on the outside casing of that dog blisters it up real good and it makes it excellent Chicago at all so I'm going to show you how we're going to cook those it's going to be fast there's not much to it and the big parts putting them together everything that goes with a Chicago dog because you know up there then run through the guard and that's what you hear them say when you go to the hotdog places that's what we're going to do so let's get to cooking all right I'm just going to get these Chicago dogs right on the grill nothing to it man you just want to get some hot charcoal you can use any kind of grill for grilling hot dogs even my five-year-old can do this there is nothing to it just wanna get them cooked on all sides will take a few minutes we'll be ready to go inside and build some Chicago dogs alright just after about a minute and a half two minutes I want to end started rolling these hot dogs over you can see I scored the ends on a four or five of them just so they would kind of split open I love the way they get kind of crunchy and it just creates a little more surface area in there and you really get some good bite on the end and it looks cool for presentation when you put these hot dogs together but alright our hot dogs a big grilling just for about five minutes and that's how I like to see them I just want some grill marks on them on a blister duck real good getting some of that grill flavor that charcoal taste on them if you want to take them to where they're a lot darker than that go ahead be my guest cook hot dogs however you like them but for me the perfect Chicago dog blistered up we got some nice grill flavor on it some nice marks all we need there we go that's our grilled Chicago dog we're getting to go inside and assemble alright so how easy that hot dog grilling process was I need some hot coals some fire heat those hot dogs on there get the outside marked off get a little blister on ready to go now it's time to assemble the Chicago style dollars you can't have a traditional Chicago style hot dog without these poppy seed buns so I ordered the bonds also when I ordered the hot dogs and they ship them in a freezer pack so you got a little fallout and to get them back to that soft stage I kind of set up my homemade steamer at home I just kind of pot I bought the water bowl and put a colander in it with a dish towel over it bring that water up to a bowl put those buns in there just for a few minutes and they're right back soft just like the day they were faked so we get the buns open here on the plate now we're going to start simple in the Chicago goes so let's take one of these grilled ones and we'll just get one of the regular ones that we did split and do a couple different ways so for Chicago dog the first step is mustards regular yellow mustard and you better not come with ketchup in Chicago because it is not allowed on a hotdog after the mustard we're coming with this bright green relish that's famous in Chicago and that's really what brings the color to this style of hotdog after the bright green pickle relish comes a little bit of chopped fine onion you got to have all this on the Chicago dog that's what make it this is what running through the garden is so after that we're going to tuck in a couple slices of tomato cut into little wedges got to have it to meit other I'm lucky on this that you're fresh out of the garden I'm going to come with a pickle on this side little tomato and this hot dog oh man it's a middle of the bun you get the salad now you have sport peppers and usually they have two on each one so that's what we're going to do today and last but not least you've got to have that celery salt just a dash to top it off and that my friends is a chicago-style hot dog and it is awesome all right now for the part of the day always when you're cooking time to get the try by hmm there's no way around ugly Chicago dogs you got to dive right in I love that char dog put it on the grills to the steam inner Bowman it gives the hot dog so much more flavor just to get it out on that grill even though it only takes five minutes it puts all that flavor on the outside skin of that hot dog you gotta give this chicago dog of trying telling you run it through the garden get your pickles and pepper relish and sport peppers and onions and fresh tomatoes it all makes the awesome dog they know what they're doing up there in Chicago so the next time you want to make a really great hot dog at
