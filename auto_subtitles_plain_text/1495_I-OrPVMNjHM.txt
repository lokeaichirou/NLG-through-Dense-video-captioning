 hello so today's recipe is going to be a margarita pizza for this you're going to need some strong white bread flour plain flour salt fast-action dried yeast extra virgin olive oil and some warm water I will put all the measurements down below I'm using my stand mixer today but you can do this part by putting the ingredients in and you'll be using a knife to mix it up at first so I'm gonna add in both flours your salt and yeast and I'm just gonna give this a quick mix so once you mix them together I've made a little well in the middle and you're gonna put in your oil and some of your water and this is the part where you will be getting a knife and mixing all this part in yeah so I'm gonna give it a mix and I'll show you what I'm done okay so you keep mixing it don't add in all of your water and we keep an eye on it make sure it isn't too sticky and just keep mixing this until it becomes a smooth dough so once you're happy with the consistency of the dough as you can see it's not sticky it's very smooth in my little pot here which I had the olive oil on I just brushed around the edges of the bowl to stop the dough from sticking and I'm going to cover this with cling film and I'm gonna it rest in a warm spot for about an hour and depending how warm it is until it's doubled in size basically so once your dough is double in size like that you are going to break this into four and make four little pizzas out of it so then you're going to need tomato I've got tomato puree right here with onion granules and some oregano in there and you're going to need some low fats to show you pack it this is half fat mozzarella I'm gonna need some cherry tomatoes some bug and you're going to need some parmesan in there so once you've done your four little disks you're going to roll it out with a rolling pin to 20 centimeters I'm just going to carry on with the rest and I will show you the next step so once you've rolled them out I've put it on my pizza tray and I've put my tomato puree mixture on top and then I'll separate it my cheese into four and you just fill up your pizza next toppings puzzle Parmesan cheese and then you're going to put this in the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes there we go so that's the pizza done we're one of them anyway I forgot to mention to add some black pepper on to that before you put it into the oven and it's 13 points per pizza but the recipe actually calls for you to make a speedy tomato sauce but I've used tomato puree so I will adjust the points and find out what they are so that will be in the description box below with all the measurements so hope you enjoyed the recipe if you try it out as always let me know what you think and I will see you in the next video what you think mmm really good winner yeah definitely thumbs up you
