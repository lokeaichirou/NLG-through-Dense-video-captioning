 we're adam and joanne from inspiredtaste.net and today we're showing you how to make extra smooth hummus it's really easy you're gonna start with tahini which is a creamy sesame paste just give it a stir and measure out about a quarter of a cup then add it to a food processor or blender next you'll need some lemon juice we like to use about a quarter of a cup but you could use a little less or a little more depending on your taste add the lemon juice to the teeny but use a strainer to make sure no seeds get through now process for about one minute the tahini and lemon juice creamed together and become thick whipped and creamy that's the secret to creamy hummus all right now for some flavor we like to use about half a clove of garlic but we peel and mince it really fine first that way we help out the processor and no one is ever gonna bite into a big piece of garlic next two tablespoons of olive oil about half of a teaspoon of ground cumin and some salt start with half a teaspoon and then taste later and add as you need it just scrape the bottom of the bowl and process again after about a minute open up the lid scrape again and continue to process this all helps to make extra smooth premium now for the chickpeas we use one can but we drain and rinse it first add about half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for another minute scrape then add the remaining cookies now process for ones two minutes until extra smooth go ahead and scrape the bowl again and now to make things really really smooth and just like the hummus you buy at the store we like to add two to three tablespoons of water this just thins it out a little bit you can add as much or as little as you want as you add the water you can literally see it gets smoother and smoother [Music] so good okay you're done give it a test [Music] add it to a plate and then top with olive oil or paprika and enjoy
