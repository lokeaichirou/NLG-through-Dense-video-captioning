 hello I'm Georgie from Jamie's food team and I'm going to show you how to prepare the base for your soup so we've got here the key ingredients what celery carrots onions and garlic and this is the perfect base for any soup not just the soup we're making today and all of these will add great flavor sweetness and they can be used for almost any soup so what you want to do is if you just remember - so you want two sticks of celery two onions two carrots two cloves of garlic and that will sort you out so start with the celery now depending on whether or not you're blitzing your soup or you're keeping it as a broth or determine how chunky or fine you want to chop your veg always have an empty bowl to hand as well for scraps it just makes it easier then keep going to dustbin so for the set oh you don't need to peel it just trim off the ends and if you want it for brothy soup it's quite nice to keep it quite chunky if you're going to blitz up it doesn't really matter to be honest as long as you get lots of lovely color and you soften it you're going to bliss up anyway so slice up your celery fish that's one side and now with the carrots depends on how you know small or fresher carrots are you can peel with them I'll just describe them just let peel these remove the onion cuts it in half I always find it easier to take the outside off if you cut in half first keep the root intact because that's where that will help keep the onion layers together so when you're cutting it won't fall apart if you chop that off then you'll be in trouble because then all the layers will fall apart and you'll make it much harder to chop so keep that whole and you can just discard it at the end and again kind of onions as fine or chunky as you like depending on your type of soup and then feed garlic just need a couple of cloves I just cut off the end just to make a bit easier to crush get the skins off so put the flats of your knife on top of the garlic using the palm your hair and just push down let's push too hard and this is the easiest way to get the skin off and again you can slice or chop your garlic I like to slice it just because I don't like it to burn or catch too easily and if you chop it too fine it can catch an even really bitter taste so just slice it quite fine there you have it there the base ingredients and all you have to do now is let them get lovely bits of color okay so put it on medium low heat I'm going to add the garlic first just for a minute just cuz I'll get a little bit of color onto my garlic there we go is getting lightly golden now so that's perfect at the rest of your base a good stir and then literally to saute the vegetables soft and this will give you fantastic flavor the base of any soup so there we have it that's the base of our soup and as I said before that'll be the base for almost any soup those are the key ingredients my lovely and sticky and sweetened they've been cooked down and now we've got them to that stage we can get on with the rest of our soup okay now we've made our base on a turn this into really delicious tomato and basil soup so all we need to do is we'll turn this back on back onto a medium heat and we're going to put in a tin of really good tinned tomatoes that's on the side and break it up a bit just put a tin of plum tomatoes and broken them up a bit lot of do now is add 3 fresh tomatoes a nice tip here is actually you could if you wanted add the stalks as well because loads of flavor if you smell that that's actually where that amazing vine tomatoes smell comes from it's not the tomatoes themselves it's the stalks and they'll break down and actually you know what put them in as well some chicken stock if you're vegetarian you can use vegetable 'im we've got a litre really lovely organic chicken stock there and then gently just bring everything to the boil season it well get some freshly ground black pepper good sea salt bring it to the boil and then simmer it for 15-20 minutes and put in some fresh basil so I grabbed some the bigger leaves we can use the little ones for garnishing later stir that through I need to now splits it till it's smooth there we go that still got a bit of texture to it which is lovely if you want it super smooth than just care and blitzing it that's fine and you can finish the soup belf however you like really it's really lovely with like little basil oil we have to do is crush up some basil leaves and a pestle and mortar bash them up with a pinch of salt really good oil and drizzle that on top or you could even finish it off with a really good homemade pesto some shavings of parmesan or a little chopped red chili for a little kick that'll be great so we have it just because I absolutely love loads of black pepper to put an extra pinch soup it up a couple of beautiful little puzzle leaves and drizzle there you have it really fantastic and dead easy tomato and basil soup
