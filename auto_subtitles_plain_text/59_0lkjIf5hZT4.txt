 hi guys it's Warren here and today I'm making the ultimate Mexican recipe and it's for Chile beef burrito served in a crisp tortilla and this is enough to make four burritos we'll begin by making the beef chili so take 1 onion cut the ends off slice it in half and then peel then using a sharp knife finely chop the onion now take 2 garlic cloves peel them and finely chop as well now place a saucepan over a high heat on the stove and heat some oil once it's hot place the onion and garlic into the pan and fry for about 5 minutes then take 400 grams of brown beef and place into the pan and then it's time to add all spices so add in a 1 TSP of chili powder 1 teaspoon of cumin 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of Oregon and then fry the ingredients until the beef has browned up nicely and remember you can watch hundreds more of my cooking videos by subscribing to my channel by clicking on the link on-screen once the beefs cooked then add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes followed by good squirt of tomato puree crumble in one a beef stock cube and then combine the ingredients together once everything's mixed together top the chili up with some hot water until the ingredients are just covered and then it leave to simmer away with the lid on for 20 minutes and after 20 minutes give the chili stir and then add 1 tin of kidney beans that have been rinsed and washed stir the beans in and then leave the chili to simmer away for a further 10 minutes with the lid off meanwhile take 1 red pepper that's been washed then cut the end off and remove the core and seeds then cut the pepper into chunks and 5 minutes away from the chili being done stir the peppers in for the remaining cooking time and then when you're happy the Chili's cooked and the sauce is nice and thick removed from the heat make your burritos by taking 4 tortilla wraps and splitting the chili between them then tightly wrap each tortilla up with the chili packed into the middle then take a large nonstick frying pan and place on the stone heat some oil up and then place the burritos in the pan Brown each burrito by carefully moving them around the pan and was flipping regularly in order for them to brown on all sides remember to brown the edges and then when lovely and golden and crisp on all sides they're ready to serve and of course these go great with a big dollop of sour cream and remember you can watch hundreds more of my cooking videos by subscribing to my channel by clicking on the link on-screen
