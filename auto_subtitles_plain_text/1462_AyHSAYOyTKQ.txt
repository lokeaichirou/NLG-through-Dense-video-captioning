 welcome to cooking in HD it's Bart and today I'm making for you a beef Bergen young the thing about my beef bourguignon recipe is that it's inspired by the classic Julia Child's recipe which serve as the hallmark for French cooking but I've also used some Tyler Florence techniques to simplify it a little bit and I've added my own twist which is to use beef cheeks and the neck of a cow to make a really really succulent and tender piece of beef that will literally melt in your mouth so stick around and I'll show you how to make this delicious beef bourguignon recipe okay guys let me show you what's going into our beef bourguignon and I start with my favorite part the booze so we need some good cognac um you don't need like the really expensive kind but um buy something decent you need a bottle of Burgundy wine which is actually how that where this dish gets its name from this bottle costs about 20 bucks it's not the cheapest but um use something good and hopefully in your part of the world it's a bit cheaper I've got some all-purpose flour in there I've got beef broth olive oil I've got some time which I'm going to use in a bouquet garni with my rosemary I've got some tomato paste pepper salt I'll use a few cloves of garlic one yellow onion and two or three carrots so let me show you guys why my beef burger your recipe stands apart from others this is a neck of a cow that's what this cut is called I know it's fairly rare and you can actually ask your butcher if you order to have time they can usually get this for you I had this in Portugal at a Portuguese steakhouse and this kind of beef is amazing it's so tender and flavorful but it has to be cooked low and slow so it's perfect for this beef bourguignon recipe and then this is the cheek of a cow a beef cheek and a and if you look in here there's just so much marbling there's connective tissue and so many good things this actually has a bit of a rough texture to it but I guarantee you if you can get this in this recipe once you cook it properly it's just going to melt in your mouth it's absolutely amazing and really inexpensive and finally I've got some smoked bacon in this package here and i'm going to use about five or six strips all right so now you can see I've cubed my beef into about one and a half inch squares these are the cheeks same left some fat on it I've tried to trim up most of it but you know fat equals flavor so I don't want to cut all the fat off now I've cut my bacon into what are called lardons which just mean sort of long skinny pieces like this and actually lard on is the name of the restaurant in Toronto on roxas ville Avenue where I got the inspiration for doing this recipe and I'm going to put the bacon lardons into a large pot which has some boiling water in it and that's going to actually help crisp up the bacon and I know that seems counterintuitive but believe me it works ok so my bacon is nice and golden brown and crispy so now with the slotted spoon I'm just going to drain with the fat drain out a little bit you put it on a paper towel I want to leave the fat behind because I'm going to actually just brown the outside of the beef for my beef bourguignon in the bacon fat right now I've got salt and pepper on the outside of these and i literally just take a handful and throw them in and start flying the other side for just a minute or through the picture it's got a a nice brown coating on the outside I don't want to crowd this so this is probably enough and i'll do the whole thing in bathroom there's the first batch of deep that i fried up you can see it's kind of a a little bit browned on the outside and i'm just going to do the same for the remaining pieces check on those saut√© my onions and my carrot of the Flying Cloud medium chocolate I just want to soften them up and I've just added one heaping tablespoon of tomato paste and two big tangle spoons of flour and I'm just going to mix this around cover everything and fry it all together okay next I'm gonna add about 1 cup of pena and I'm going to mix this up and then I'm going to light it to get all the alcohol out of here you know the alcohol just boil out but um I think I'm okay you see it's lit do flings alright so the alcohols now burnt off and I'm just going to take ol bottle of wine and just dump it in there by the way I tasted this just to make sure it was in court because you don't want to go this far and then find out that you used a cork bottle of one okay now i'm just putting the beef back in and you know you saw me put in a bunch of flour earlier that's actually going to help thicken the beef bourguignon and this sort of cherry color a wine color is going to darken over time as we braise it and then we're going to add some beef stock and i'll show you how much to add just based on the sort of the level of liquid in in the pot got what's called a bouquet garni these are the herbs that you saw me use earlier I've tied them up using butchers twine there's a bay leaf thyme and rosemary I'm going to put that in and then I'm just going to put in a little bit more beef stock I reckon maybe I don't know cup or cup and a half okay what I want to do next is bring this up to like sort of a fast simmer and once it's thoroughly heated I'm going to take this and put it in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit alright so I just brought this up to a boil and now i'm going to put the lid on and we'll put in the oven full at 300 degrees fahrenheit well it's been one hour so we'll take this out of the the oven and check on our beef bourguignon alright so you can see the liquid starting to reduce down there's a little bit less of it will give it a mix and then I'll put it back in for another hour and then we'll check on it again okay now we're going to add grow onions and some cremini mushrooms to the beef or genome and for that I need just a few sprigs of thyme obviously pearl onions I have blanched these and the peeled um like yesterday so the day before i made this because there is a little bit of effort required to get these done and so you probably want to prepare them ahead of time a few cloves of garlic cremini mushrooms and some extra virgin olive oil is what you need for the next step so my garlic is in my pearl onions have a little bit of color on them my mushrooms have some color on them it's now time to add this is that be for a venial okay so let me show you guys what I did I've added the pearl onions the mushrooms and the garlic into the beef bourguignon and I've also added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar just it was a little bit acidic and I thought that it would bounce it and it has and i've added salt and pepper just to suit my taste and now it's ready to go back in the oven for about another 45 minutes and that will finish it off ok guys so here is the final product as you can see I've got my beef cheeks and my neck of beef plated over some egg noodles and I've got garnished it with I'm and parsley and I've got pieces of bacon on top so let me taste this for you and I'll show you that looks like inside and if I just cut in literally the meat is just falling apart I mean you can just pull it apart and it is absolutely delicious so this from oh it's like butter and melt in your mouth is incredible and what great value for meat that really isn't expensive but if you cook it properly it's just so tender and juicy absolutely incredible this may be one of the tastiest things that I've made on cooking in HD give it a try I know you guys will love it I'll see you next time on cooking
