 hey guys I'm Amy and I'm Julie we are the Duncan sisters welcome to the scoffs kitchen today in our Asian bite series we are doing a Singapore fried rice noodle with curry is you can see it's this bright yellow sort of concoction and it's super yummy so let's get started so the notice that we're going to be using today are rice noodles which are ones like this all we've done here is just soak them in cold water for about half an hour we're going to leave them in there until they're ready to cook so next up we're going to do our prawns which is the meat in this dish all we want to do is pop in a wee bit of corn flour about a teaspoon for 150 grams as good this coats all the prawns and gives it like a really kind of well alloxan or the moisture of the poison also gives it a really kind of like a silky coating around the no one likes a rubbery fraud so we just put about a tablespoon of oil in the wok now you want this quite hot don't you do them you do you have to basically see those prawns immediately so in it goes so we're just going to stir fry these for about two to three minutes until they're flesh of the prawns is pink and firm so as you can see the paws are now a lovely opaque kind of peach color and I've got a lovely little crust on them as well so they're ready to come out lovely person job last week obviously brilliant so for the omelette I have a couple of beaten eggs with some salt and pepper and some oil and we just want to put that right into a hot frying pan now you could just do the eggs as a scramble in the wok as well but I think there's something really like is quite joyful about picking up ribbons of eggs we're going to cut that on into ribbons so picking them up with your chopsticks along with the with the rice noodles so the egg is just cooking now we haven't moved it at all and we're just going to keep it on here until it's almost although pay before you transfer it to the chopping ball cause it's going to keep on cooking from the residual heat so almost there so the omelet is ready to come out of the pan so just slide it straight onto your chopping board and then we're gonna roll this baby up a bit hot it is and you can see how the undersides lovely and golden like those blistered bits yeah it looks like Tiger KK she doesn't it does look like Tiger Kate which is one of the recipes that we have in our upcoming cookbook so plug a little pride yeah I'll let me just like flip that over like so just cut this into strips you can see that these ribbons are going to be almost like it's all it's like egg noodles yeah yeah lovely all right so we'll fire up the wok get it on a kind of medium heat and then we'll pop some oil in so and with the garlic look this sizzle a wee bit thanks Amy Oh lovely so we'll just let that kind of do its thing releasing its flavours for a bit and we like to do the onions and the garlic first because they flavor the oil which is going to be really delicious for the real movies as well so we're really now to put an our red pepper now this stays you don't really need to cook up for too long we're just going to stir fry this for about a minute because it's all gonna go back and to the noodles later so here and about the stage when you can see that the onion kind of has a little blisters on it yeah everything is pretty much ready to come out sorry just pop it straight back into your vessel you guys so that is it for the beach we're ready to get onto the noodles so for this we only want the wok on kind of like a low to medium heat and and we'll pop some oil in there about a tablespoon and this is the part we will just fish these noodles straight out of here so they stay moist because I though the rice flour which is what these are made of and alum sucks up moisture a lot so just give it like a little shake and then straighten and so that we are going to add some curry powder which has been mixed up with a wee bit of water so when you do the sudden pace it just makes a bit easier to incorporate into the noodles yeah I always get clumps of curry and it's like it's not fair someone gets more care how you feel about that I knew that okay right so did we get two spatulas and we'll just incorporate that courier all the way it's gonna take a little bit of tossing action you can just leave the water here just get your hands in the sprinkle it in the way that mom used to do it right you can bring that heat up a little bit so we're using the heat now to really soften them and use the residual photos like moisture that was still hanging on to each noodle and kind of cook through okay now we're going to put on some bean sprouts so I mean if you want to take over the section and now see all the other foots we couldn't fill it all back in and then if you follow the noodles are trained to clump together away but just a wee bit more water let's just gently doesn't really because if you put it all in one so you've worn it with Drew cilia we're gonna go back in with the broad and then your gonna eat ribbons about a tablespoon of soy sauce for seasoning so you just need to finish up some spring onions that's right for a bit of freshness and vitality oh and a wee bit of salt so popping a wee bit of salt there and spring onions okay final toss and then we're ready to plate up so how good is this looking bright yellow I can smell that curry I can't
