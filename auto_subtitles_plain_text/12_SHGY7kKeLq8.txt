 hey there it's bill Weston barbecuetricks.com everybody loves a good bratwurst good cookout bratwurst are pretty easy but the big thing you need to remember is the insides of a bratwurst are raw sausage round meat so you're going to want to cook the sausage up to the correct temperature unlike a steak or any other meat unlike the guys that they're usually cooked along with their distant cousin the hot dog pretty much cooked already you can eat them raw and be fine these you got to get them up to temperature and I found three different ways that you can do just that brats can be made out of beef veal or pork one where you're using are the most common in the states here labeled all premium pork on the packaging but bratwurst is an old German name derived from throt which is finely chopped meat and Wurst which means sausage brats are almost like cheese there's so many different varieties 40 different varieties if you want to go online and look them up but it basically it's raw sausage so you got to get it cooked and the most basic way is going straight to the grill for a lot of people it's fine you may want to brush it with a little light coating of oil before you hit the grill it can help a little crisp texture to the casing and you're going to want to grill over indirect heat for about 15 to 20 minutes it's going to take some time usually longer than everything else on the grill is like burger so keep that in mind indirect heat which means not directly over the flames it's going to allow you to get the internal temperature up a little slower and I get the sausage hot enough without over charring the rest of the broth the other benefit is keeps the flare-ups down you want the final product you appear golden brown with an unbroken skin if you can't I won't worry too much about that and make sure you use an instant-read thermometer to make sure you hit the recommended internal temperature of 170 degrees or at least close if it's going to sit around a little bit longer remember just because the outside is charred inside may not be done yet so use the thermometer it's also coming to precook or par boil the bratwurst in a pan from the comfort of your kitchen or use that side burner that you never use on the grill just add one or two inches of your favorite beer into a pan over medium heat add the sliced onions maybe some peppers and the brats bring it to the lowest possible simmer that you can you don't want to boil it you don't want to rupture the skins of the brats by getting the liquid to hot cook it for about six to eight minutes and then you get to finish it off on the grill like you did in the first procedure with a shorter grilling time only three to six minutes that removes a lot of the worry about the insides being cooked the third way to cook these is kind of a combination of the first two someone once called that a brats tub I think it's the most fun way to cook brats simple shallow pan with the same mixture we just did butter onions and a beer or two and you put that pin right there on the side of the grill also over indirect heat but get it hot this gives the brats a little hot bath after your first grilling step that way you can keep them cooking always have a hot broth on handy to pay attention to the game or socializing and also eliminate some of the worry about it not cooking long enough you don't have to hover over the grill as much a couple other pointers use tongs never a fork you don't want to prick the casing that would diminish the juiciness of the end product and also could cause a big flare-up and if you even want to add a lick of smoke even to a gas grill you can toss in a foil smoker pouch full of wood chips under the grate before cooking it's real easy you can see how we do it on the website if you like this video we appreciate it if you subscribe rate and comment on iTunes YouTube even Facebook and for tips tricks and other fun stuff head over to WWE
