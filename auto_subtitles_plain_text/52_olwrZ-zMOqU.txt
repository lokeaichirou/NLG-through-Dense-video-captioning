 okay hello everyone um so I haven't been doing a lot of cooking tutorials here lately because it's been getting into summer summertime more about just eating fresh stuff a lot and not so much I get off the meat a lot in the summer and definitely don't cook a lot of big meals and solid but those German recipes on the on the site you know those seem to be so far like the most popular and I thought I'm going to make them I had a hankering for some schnitzel so I thought I'd make some uh so I make pork schnitzel I don't even feel at all I haven't ate veal since I was a kid and I saw some documentary about what they do those poor cows so I mean I know all meats bad but pork schnitzel is really good you don't have it's greenish schnitzel and that's veal but I just use pork these were frozen i buy a pack and I've seen him in the grocery store their boneless pork chops basically first thing I want to do is I want to get all I get all the fat off of it I pushed it soul and pork chops you know I might leave that fat on there but for uh no not pushing it so I don't want any fat at all on the schnitzel and I'm even going to cut off this little end piece all the way off you know as you if you've ever seen any my videos I have dogs so cook that up and they're going to hit love that okay so do the same on here now this thing we're going to pound it and it's going to be quite a bit bigger than it is right now ok so here I've got my two pieces fat off and then you need one of these you know pounding things you start how I do it is I start with the big teeth there's big teeth and small teeth I start with the big teeth one side the other side and then what this does it just kind of loosens up the fiber of the knee if you start right in with the little one sometimes it ends up falling apart so I do this first like so now I go back add it with a little one is the thing about soul is you want it to be pretty much like paper cinemas I just remember I don't have any fresh lemon either so look that's you know this is what it looks like now it's very large and very thin I'm going to do the same with the other one flip it okay so these two feet normally you know when like I'll do one more the reason I did that a little one works i picked it up and it felt too thick so it should be very thin you know almost a little bit thicker than paper you know okay so here's a step one next step is we're going to read it and then we're going to fry it in some while and then you serve it with a little lemon and butter okay I'll be back in a bit to show you the breading all right I'm back and I'm on to the next step here this is the same reading technique that I use on the porch as if you watch that video the only difference on this is I don't add any garlic in this case so what I have over here i'm getting my little workstation setup flower here i'm going to crack an egg now i'm only making two so i'm not using much but you'd want to adjust your proportions a little bit more a little bit of milk and always in my breading stuff I always just throw in a little shot of soy sauce to it don't know why I got into that habit ok so I've got over here flour egg milk tiny drop of soy sauce then the third step is usually our normal circumstances would be you know just seasoned bread crumbs but I've been doing this mix lately and I'm really liking this mix I always forget to have a dry fork to mix it up so I'm going to add a little bit of seasoned breadcrumbs a little bit of that would be Italian season this is wheat wheat bread crumbs pull we playing and then panko I get panko rocks man panko is some good stuff I mean it looks kind of funky now but it really does given a really nice kind of crunchy texture you know a schnitzel I mean I'm making it a spork when I was in Germany practically every other item on the menu and the restaurants were schnitzel seneschal schnitzel so they make it all sorts of different ways and different things on it this is my ex mother-in-law's recipe i learned how to make it from her she was the shuttle schnitzel queen so shout-out to Marianne alright so here we go i'm just going to do these 2 i've got my thinly pounded out pork loin i'm going to get a nice coating of flour throw it in the egg do the same with this just sit it in the flour for a second here oops sometimes in this you might have to use your fingers i'd try not to because i don't want all the goop on my finger that's gross wow my kids are going up we would make 2 i'd make you know they would just die for this stuff we just gobble it up it was one of our favorite dinners you had a patty once a week ok so that's there and I'm going to get this one coated with flour see on the pork chops I also rubbed some garlic on I don't put the garlic in the schnitzel because that's how she didn't do it that way so I kind of just I pretty much stick to her recipe other than the soy sauce here and the panko mixture thing here okay so i got i have this on a piece of wax paper and give it a coating flip it another coating sometimes it helps oops sometimes it helps if you kind of press press that breading down on there i find really get it is i like a lot of breading this is pretty much you know fried bread a little bit of meat in there ok so there's that's one and I'm gonna do the same with this one and then all it is is you just tell we're going to fry it up in a little bit of a little bit of oil I think she used olive oil on this but I'm not going to i'm going to use canola I'm gonna have to use my hands because this is folding so there we go get it in there she can see give it a sprinkle on each side I think I have enough here try to try to make that work there we go yeah I don't like goopy hands so I've got it on my finger this doesn't have to really wash my hands out really good they have to anyway great cuz you're handling raw pork you're gonna have to wash your hands up you know with antibacterial soap and the whole whole bit okay so I'm just going to give this a little bald spot there the bare spot get it make sure it's really coated okay so here we have normally before I was making this have a stack this high of ash that's all that's just me and this is I'll probably eat one today and save one so here it is these are the finished ready to fry and then we're going to move on to the next phase of frying them up and top with a little butter and lemon I didn't get fresh lemon so I'm gonna have to maybe use lemon juice I know but I'll be back to show you the frying process in a few minutes okay here i am with stove I've got some oil it's got a couple drops of water in it that's why it's from doing that you know stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and get my skips off oh yeah hard time here give it into the pan as i said earlier i'm just using canola oil I sleek like some other ways to use olive oil you can use whatever you want I think canola is better for this kind of thing some things I like olive oil on that's just ain't one of them okay so get it in the oil I'm going to crank it and i'm just going to brown it on both sides so just keep an eye on it and then when its brown on one side you take your fork and flip and then it'll be browned on the other side all right so check back in a few minutes when it's completely browned alright so here's just a couple minutes later and thank you sniffles are done this one's definitely done the other ones not quite in brown but that's okay because I'm not going to eat it both today so then this one will be when I warm it up I'll probably one laughing out toaster oven or something and I'll have a little little room to be brown down I'm going to scoot over here and show you too since I'm not going to eat this one today I'm just going to not do it but normally how we always did it was my knife this is it hot out of the fire you put a little tablet butter on it right away and then that melts and then you add fresh lemon would be preferable but I'm going to probably have to use some just a bottle of lemon juice so you let that butter melt down there and then you put a little lemon on it and wound ova I was going to say many feet but I better these German and say Bulova Bulova okay so now you know how to make pork schnitzel enjoy
