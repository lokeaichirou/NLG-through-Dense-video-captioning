 all right you have to look at my frying pan again about a tablespoon of olive oil and you're going to cook one large onion and you'll start with this so it can cook till it is caramelized my kids have a bit of a sweet tooth they do not like onion but if I caramelize it they don't even notice onion or sometimes they don't notice that the onions are in it so that's gonna cook a while while I prepare and chop the other food so while my onions are cooking I'm gonna chop up one romaine heart into small I'd say slices but so you get this broken up okay I finished the Leveson I start the onions it's starting to turn a little bit Brown my husband wanted to thought salsa would be good but I wanted to go with some fresh vegetables I don't like don't always like going with a can especially since you may go with can in with the beans so two tomatoes chopped into or diced great this is a very pretty color and it tastes just right for the onions all right you have a good another onion because I thought it needs it I'm going to add turn this down to low and let that cook while my rice is cooking this is about 3 cups of wild rice cooked in a pressure cooker adjustment I will use jasmine rice cooked on the stove as well but the pressure cooker gives it the kind of machinist that I like pour in the dressing and stir now it's time to construct your burrito you have your tortilla that has been heated in the oven for about five minutes at 350 you have your lettuce your tomatoes your rice and your beans then fold it up and you're ready to eat enjoy your insane vegetarian burrito
