 everyone loves to cook breakfast down again and no cook breakfast would be complete without some of these little babies let's make some hashbrowns on the one pot chef to make our hashbrowns first things first we're going to obviously need some potatoes and what I've done is I've just run a kilo potatoes through the food processor using the shredding blade if you don't have a food processor you can just run them through a cheese grater and I'll put them into a colander with a glass bowl underneath or you can just stick it in the sink and just squeeze the potatoes with your hands just to get rid of all that excess liquid I've transferred a potato into a large mixing bowl and to that I'm adding in two tablespoons of flour just plain flour a little bit of salt and some pepper I'm also adding in some garlic powder which is great for a bit of extra flavor you don't have to use garlic it's entirely optional you could also use a different herbal spice that you prefer or make your own mixture and one lightly beaten egg and just using a spoon just mix all that together i divided the mixture into little patties and we're just going to flatten them out as we cook them I've got my fry pan with a bit of olive oil on the bottom and we're just going to heat this over a medium heat until it's nice and steaming hot we're going to cook our hashbrowns in batches be careful putting them in three all the first go and just press them down slightly to flatten them and we're going to fry these for about two to three minutes each side or until they're golden and crispy these are looking golden and delicious we're just going to transfer these onto a baking tray lined with some absorbent kitchen paper once all the hashbrowns have been fried we're just going to put this into a low oven 120 degrees Celsius for about five to ten minutes just to make sure they're nicely warmed through and fully cooked and here are some of our completed hashbrowns looking absolutely gorgeous and they smell amazing so I'm going to have a little taste mmm young mm-hmm Brisbane golden and gorgeous on the outside and got that fluffy sort of little bit's potato all inside you can really taste the garlic in it which is great because you can pretty much change the flavor of these to whatever suits your own personal taste this is perfect as part of a nice full cooked breakfast bacon and eggs and sausages but it's two o'clock in the afternoon when I'm recording this so I don't really feel like cooking a full breakfast at this time oh I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show comm and until next time see you later
