 hi this is pretend you're watching duction curry but they're just breakfast time tea time snack dinner or a roadside meal the most sought-after recipes are usually idlis and those are and put the pumps today I'll be showing you a really really super easy to make masala dosa recipe and you know how to make that statement so when I say masala dosa obviously there's going to be a batter involved and there is a masala that has to be made now this masala is made from a potato filling and let's have a look at the ingredients for the same now for the masala I will be using around 2 to 3 medium size potatoes and to make the third cup for that I'll be using some oil around one and a half teaspoons of oil 1/2 a teaspoon each of mustard seeds chana dal chopped green chillies some curry leaves he in for chopped coriander I have some red chilli and garlic paste that I have made I'll show you how to make it later on I have 1 medium sized onion which I have finely chopped salt to taste and pinch of turmeric and last but not the least obviously dosa batter now that we have had a look at her ingredients let's get started with the filling I have a pan here and I'm adding oil now like I told you I said 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of oil why don't I have teaspoons of oil is for making the filling we will require oil probably a teaspoon of oil or half a teaspoon of oil to make your dosas for each those are that's separate so let's add a third kind radiance I'm adding around 1/2 a teaspoon of mustard cheese the flame and once that starts to crackle I can actually add the chana dal also little bit of chana dal we'll just allow master to splatter the rest of the ingredients add some curry leaves some green chillies I'm using two varieties here the red chillies are nice and spicy a little bit of heat a little bit of coriander this is optional the corianders optional but somehow it gives a nice flavor these chilies are really really hot now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the onion I'm going to reserve some onions very little just to show you something it is done usually on the roadside now if you want you can also slice the onions you'll add a little bit of salt to allow the onions to faster now we don't need to cook this till it's brown just till it's translucent and now we'll add a little bit of turmeric and potatoes now these are medium-sized 2 to 3 potatoes what I've done is I have boiled them in the pressure cooker with their field then I have discarded the peel I have not added any salt while cooking the potato if you want you can also add the garlic and all but I'm just making the most basic version now let's add the main ingredient that's the salt now as you know I already add a little bit of salt so keep that in mind just give this um mix and what we'll do is we'll just cook this for a few seconds till it's all come together and then we'll transfer it into a bowl and then we will start with the dosa process now that our potatoes are cooked I have just removed it transferred it onto a bowl now the next process would be to make the dosa so I have a Tavia a nonstick tava now I'm going to put this on the dosa mode and what I'll be doing is applying a little bit of oil and I'm just dipping a small chopped onion if you want you can also use a tissue generally we make those on a wrought-iron table [Music] what we will do is we'll add our those up I'm going to be adding the batter as you can see this batter is nice and smooth what we'll do is take a small lady [Music] or in a circular motion and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to add some oil to cook at any stage if you feel that your induction is getting too hot what we'll be doing now is we'll be adding the red chili and garlic paste at that stage if you feel it's going to get a little too hot what you can do is you can switch off the induction smear the paste and then switch it on again not a problem it's not going to hinder the cooking of the dosa at all now that I've added the oil what I'll be doing is I'll be adding the paste here now this is nice and spicy so not ideal adding a lot of it little now what I have done is I have sold dried red chilies a good quantity around 10 to 15 around 8 to 10 cloves of garlic and then I have ground it into a paste now fuze want to store this for long you can add vinegar in this I have also added a little bit of salt now what we'll do is we'll just allow this to cook can see that these pots are getting a little brown now what I'm going to do at this stage is I'm going to add a little bit of onions and because it's getting brown I'm going to switch off the flame now usually in the roadside they do this you know they add a little bit of onions and coriander when they are stuffing the door sound is completely optional [Music] just going to add that and I'm going to take a good portion of potatoes around two to three tablespoons now in the roadside what we usually do is in Bombay they smear this nicely evenly if you go to the hotels what they do is they just add it in between and then they serve it so whichever way you want it can do that now I'm just going to switch this on again the reason like I told you before why I switched off the induction was because I saw a little starting to get brown and I don't want my daughter to burn nor do I want the paste to burn now once this is done you know that a dosa is ready if you want to cook this little more what you can do is drizzle some more oil on top that is not required actually so what I'm going to do is just see if the dough size cooked on this side as you can see yes it has so we just push this off and I'm going to just remove a plate for myself - first roll this sleep as you can see nice masala dosa is ready nice and crisp and did not take too much of oil since then masala dosa are really easy to make what are you waiting for I hope that you will make this recipe and I'm waiting for your feedback if you like this recipe
