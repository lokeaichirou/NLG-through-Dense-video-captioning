 let's make a shepherd's pie so what is a shepherd's pie well it's a cottage pie that's instead of using ground beef it's ground lamb you know it's just a meat and potatoes kind of dish which is why I like it and it's made with lamb which I love lamb I realize that's not the most popular cut of meat but or animal in any way I happen to like it a lot so anyway pans hot oil is hot now good swirl I've got to undercut some onion and half a cup of carrot cut up be honest I got a little bit more than half a cup of here we're going to take your pool bit of salt in here salt helps these vegetables cook a little better my vegetables are just starting to get a little color on we're gonna do you're going to throw two tablespoons of butter in here two cloves of garlic we're gonna put in two pounds of lamb that I bought a couple days ago that's brown it's still good fresh it's edible I'm gonna kill anybody today anyway we're gonna Brown this up a little bit okay we've got our meat starting to brown a little bit we want to go ahead and I want to season the meat a little bit of salt now the the stock that I'm using today is the homemade stock and there's no I didn't put any salt than that so if you're using a store-bought stock it has lots of salt in it you may not want to put any salt in there I'm gonna put a little black pepper now herbs you can kind of use whatever whatever you liked I mean I want to put about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning because it has a nice mix anyway there's half a tablespoon there's one tablespoon and then we're gonna Brown this meat up all right we've got a little color on our meat now we're gonna mix that up a little bit what we're gonna do now is I've got two tablespoons of flour we're gonna dump this in we're gonna mix it up and we're gonna put a little color on this and then what this is gonna do is help thicken our sauce or block or whatever you want to call it anyway let me get this browned up a little bit all right we've got that makes the nco I've got some Brown in happen in the bottom of my pan I got two cups of a lamb broth or stock I'm gonna put this in and we're gonna cook this down okay I've got a heat turn down so just send me along come around once in a while scrape the bottom any that way you scrape up any Brown bits on the bottom because that's really good stuff you want that in in here we're just gonna cook this down till it's a really really thick all right so now our mixture sticking it up it looks really good so go ahead turn this off does I have half a cup of frozen peas put them in there little stir kind of blend them in oh by the way I have my oven preheating at 350 degrees F it's not quite there yet but it's getting there now going to assemble yes dish now you can use any kind of oven safe dish that you want to use it really doesn't matter sure get some juice in there just about halfway up my dish good now I've got plenty left over but what you can do is you can make one to cook now make another one and then you can actually wrap it up and freeze it potatoes he's just leftover mashed potatoes for the mashed potatoes I took them boiled some potatoes so they were nice and soft mashing some butter and cream spread this out a little bit it's like putting in sheetrock it tastes a lot better you want to make sure that you have a little bit of room at the top because you're going to have liquid bubbling up through there now I want to make some ridges before so increase the surface area the potatoes and help them Brown up and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pop this in the oven until the top is nice and brown and bubbly all right so let's take it out of the oven oh man it looks good now I'm gonna let it sit there and cool down before I cut into it and I'm gonna go ahead and take a paper towel just because I'm extremely health-conscious dab up some of this grease off the top of it you don't really have to eat that looks good and smells really good see how it tastes
