 greetings my name is Elizabeth Denise I'm the director of culinary arts and the college executive chef at Burlington County College today I'd like to make a very simple Irish box T which is a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes here we have some nice fresh shredded potato some fresh dill some mashed potatoes leftover from last night's dinner some fresh sour cream and some wonderful smoked salmon I purchased this morning we're going to start with making our potato pancake I'm just going to take a little bit of the leftover potato mash it in a bowl I'm going to take a little bit of the shredded potato and mix it with the mashed potato I'm then going to take the little pancake that I have take shredded potato and essentially just press it into the outside of the pancake so you get this wonderful little potato pancake that's coated with fresh shredded potatoes you don't want it too thick because you want it nice and crispy and you want a fluffy on the inside I've already seasoned the mashed potato so I won't be seasoning again until the pancake is out of the frying pan it's going to turn on the frying pans a little bit of oil not too much just enough to coat the bottom of the pan we're gonna let that heat up for just a moment we'll put our pancake in there you can also add things to the potato before you make a cake out of it you can add a little bit of ham or a little bit of fresh chives or fresh dill makes a wonderful addition just be a moment till the pan is heated we're gonna let that cook for about three minutes on either side so it's nice and brown so as you can see our pancake here is just about finished we're just flipped it over we did relating the pancake cook on the other side let me grab my plate just want to make sure this is nice and crispy this dish works wonderfully when everything is crispy grab my spatula put a little bit of sour cream on the bottom little bit of smoked salmon a little bit more sour cream right on the top there little bit of fresh dill and there you have a smoked salmon potato boxty great way to get rid of leftover mashed potato and make a beautiful breakfast or brunch dish you can also make this dish in miniature and serve it as an hors d'oeuvre at your next house party you
