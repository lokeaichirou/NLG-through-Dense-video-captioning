 that's how you do proper what I do that's like a fresh bratwurst never froze I think B froze long as you call them out but I've caught up a sweet Vidalia onion put them in a steam pans first and get a good light beer and then we'll put them on the grill I just put them over direct heat put this pan and let them warm up they'll come up steam ball these brats a little bit you don't want to roll them boil them but you just want them to get some good moisture going in them didn't as they get cooked through I'll take them and grill them off directly on the grape but it's a real good simple recipe for some Wisconsin beer box over here I just got some Greek seasoned onions and peppers we'll serve these along with the brats but I'm gonna put a little butter in here and get this on the fire let it melt down cook down a good flavor all right my bots been all about 30 minutes and as you say they're simmered away that's the color I want peppers and onions cooked down what I'm gonna now take them off then I'll put them back on as people want to eat them and sear them off and get them ready they'll stay hot and juicy because the ball keep going keep slowly cooking and getting warm now I'm just gonna sear them all get the color on them they'll be nice and juicy that's how you do beer brats peppers and onions it takes about two half three minutes on each side I'll just kind of look at them they're already sticking they're already starting to get colors I really just want to mark them up that turns all brown
