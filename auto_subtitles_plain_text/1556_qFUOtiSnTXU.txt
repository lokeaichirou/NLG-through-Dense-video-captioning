 hey friends is rosy and in this video I'm going to show you how to make easy mashed potatoes if you want the exact measurements that can be found on my blog I heart recipes calm so we're going to start off with our potatoes I'm using regular old russet potatoes you know the cheap price that you can get like 10 pounds for $1 and some change and those potatoes so I started off by washing and peeling the potatoes make sure you scrub them really good and then you're going to dice the potatoes and I kind of diced mine you know big chunks but you can make them smaller if you want so once they're nice and chopped up I'm going to toss them into a big old pot here and instead of boiling them in water I'm going to change up the game and boil them in chicken broth you will find that they will be so flavorful if you do this so do not skip out on this step okay so you're going to need enough chicken broth to cover up the potatoes I'm making a small amount but I will leave the measurements on my blog I heart recipes calm you can double this just bring it to a boil and you're going to boil those potatoes until they are nice and fork tender just like this okay so once they are drain the broth you don't need it anymore and now in this saucepan here I have it over medium here I'm going to melt down some butter I prefer butter but if you want margarine hey do you and just melt it completely down there ruler to toss in our potatoes okay so you see there's still in lumps and everything we don't want that I'm going to use my little cheat masher here I'm going to mash the potatoes until they are well until they look like that and now I'm going to pour in some half-and-half but if you don't have half in half you can use part milk and part cream okay so I've mastered some more number two sprinkle my seasonings I like garlic powder onion powder and a little bit of salt you can add pepper if you want and my secret ingredient is Parmesan cheese okay so I'm going to toss all that in there and now I'm going to stir it until everything is well combined once it is I'm going to turn the heat off completely and you know what I am ready to serve so to serve this I'm just going to place it into a large bowl and there we are once everything is in the bowl we're good to go but look how creamy it isn't I like fine lump free if you like little lumps or whatever in yours that's you but I like it look free and I like it really creamy I mean look at this they are really creamy this beats any boxed powdered potatoes any day so to top it off I'm just going to add some more butter even though we added butter earlier you know you got to have lots of butter on there mashed potatoes especially during the holiday and then I'm going to sprinkle on some parsley flakes or chives and I am ready to the game thank you so much for watching I truly appreciate come to I heart recipes to print out the recipe card and visit me every Sunday and Wednesdays for new video uploads
