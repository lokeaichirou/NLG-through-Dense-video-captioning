 cooking news plans vegan easy hi everyone its onion from cooking with plants and today we're making no oil potato hash browns so let's get started first of all you're going to need a large potato or depending on the quantity that you make you may want more this will make about four hashbrowns and this is the size of my hand so it gives you a gauge of how big this potato is so I've peeled it and washed it dried it with a tea towel and now I'm going to grate it okay so I've grated potato now that the potato has been grated I'm going to place it in the microwave for one and a half minutes I have an 1100 watt microwave so depending on the temperature and the power of your microwave you may need to adjust that setting but this is going in for one and a half minutes ok so this is just coming out of the microwave it's just lightly cooked through and before I add the rest of the mixture I'm just going to start heating my nonstick pan on a low to medium heat I said to this potato mixture I'm going to add two tablespoons of brown rice flour I have tried either flour just plain wheat flour I find it it gets a little bit heavy whereas the rice flour just makes it crispy and a bit lighter that's up to you whatever flour you have on hand but my preference is brown rice flour okay to that I'm going to add just a little bit of white pepper just season it to taste and about quarter of a teaspoon a heaped teaspoon of Celtic sea salt just the coarse variety is what I've got today could use whatever salt you like if you have Himalayan salt that would be great too okay I'm going to mix this with a fork and just roughly mix all the seasonings through and get the flour or mixed in as well all right now I'm going to roughly divide this into four sections and keeping my four hash browns if you want to you could also bake these in the oven or even get them started in the pan and if you have an air fryer it would be perfect for your air fryer as well so a number of options on how to cook them without oil so to help shape these they will be a little bit sticky I've just got a little bit of water on hand just to wet my fingers and help to shape them do any shape that you like Menma penny I'm just using a small pan today and I'm cooking two of these at a time but obviously if you want to make a large batch probably the oven is a better option for you and you'll want a fairly high heat maybe around 400 degrees Fahrenheit around 200 degrees Celsius and cook them for about 15 minutes then turn them over and do about another 15 to 20 minutes depending on the texture friskiness that you like for the pan cooked version I like to cook them for about 5 minutes on one side flip them over and cook them for about another 5 to 7 minutes so as you can see these are super easy to make no no pre-soaking of the potato no screening the potato I just like really simple easy recipe but don't take me long to make it also enjoy so once your hash browns are cooked all that left to do is to eat them and enjoy so my son likes to eat them with a bit of sauce or the barbecue sauce or ketchup but I like to eat them make sure just as they are you're having these for lunch today and I can't wait I love potatoes hmm healthy hashbrowns how exciting yeah probably not be making these for the next five days running yes humming I hope you make this recipe let me know what you think I say a tasty please give them a thumbs up if you liked them and don't forget to subscribe for my next recipes see you next time
