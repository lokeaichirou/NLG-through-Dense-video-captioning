 today I'm going to be making some really really easy scrambled eggs I've got four eggs four tablespoons of water that's at room temperature and one tablespoon of vegetable oil three ingredients let's get started first thing we're gonna do get all of our four eggs into our Bowl I'm just gonna start whisking those around this is a really really simple recipe and now my four tablespoons of water so that's 1 tablespoon of water correct now you can use milk if you wish however you know there's a lot of debate but in most hotels restaurants the chefs will use water most chefs believe in water over milk but at home you want a little bit more nutrition throw in the milk we'll just mix that up I want that really well whisked and then we're ready to get our pan heated up and get on to the next step all right I'm back and I've set up my hot plate here first thing get our oil in there you can just mix that around a little bit you don't want your heat to high and then I'm gonna grab all of my egg I'm just gonna get a little last minute whisk and get that right in there just like that and then what I'm gonna do is right away I'm gonna start pushing the egg if we leave the egg in there and don't move it we're gonna turn this into an omelet so I'm gonna just keep moving my egg just like this I'm actually gonna lower my heat and then you just want to push it now you do not want to have a really high beat because what will happen is your egg likes you start browning now if you like you know a little bit of a crust on your egg that's fine however I like my egg without that kind of crust and so you want to do a low heat just like that you can see how quickly this is coming together just before I started filming I did make my toast my toast is all ready to go you can see in real-time how quickly this comes together and the longer you let this sit here the more moisture is driven out of the eggs and the drier they will become and at this point right here you can see we're maybe 15 20 seconds away from plating and right there we're almost done and that's it so let's plate this up turn this element right off and I'll go get my plate all right now just zoomed in a little bit here's our beautiful egg we'll get that right on there beautiful scrambled egg platter oh that looks good that's good just like that we'll get our toast on there as well hit that with a little pepper a little bit of salt and there we go my easy scrambled eggs I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time you
