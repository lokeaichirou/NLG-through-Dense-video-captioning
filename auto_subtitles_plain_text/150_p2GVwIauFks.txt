 so today on dirty chicken today on the kitchen we are making asian chicken lettuce wraps with singapore style rice noodles in order to prepare this dish you will need to mince some chicken breast and wash it you will need two cloves of garlic freshly squeezed lime sugar two teaspoons of sugar quarter teaspoon of red chili flakes soy sauce and sesame oil to prepare the mixture for the chicken we've used sesame oil garlic sugar red chili flakes and we are preparing the freshly squeezed lime juice right now pour that in and whisk okay my lovely assistant here is going to pour in the chicken now wait we're mixing the soy sauce three tablespoons so once you have added the soy sauce it's gonna look this color okay and then you can add the chicken in there this is like your marination here and then it's ready to be cooked once it's marinated so we've decided to modify the recipe a bit and use some worcestershire sauce i cannot wish yes i cannot pronounce it properly worcestershire we're also going to use this uh v8 szechuan sauce just a little bit of it let that sit for about five minutes and we'll be right back we have made a discovery here on durgy kitchen we got this recipe from the newspaper and it's for chicken lettuce wraps nowhere in the ingredients does it say chicken and then when you read the recipe itself combine the first ingredients in a large bowl store you mix well with the wigs add chicken cilantro mint toss to combine stand for five minutes spoon two and a half teaspoons of tablespoon sorry chicken mixture into the center of the leaf do we cook the chicken or not that is the question but me being the person that i am i'm going to cook the chicken here it's a good plan good plan so even though the recipe didn't tell us to cook the chicken we're going to cook it so in a frying pan or sauce pan you're going to heat up some oil and then you're going to throw that chicken in there and let it cook okay we'll be right back to show you what it looks like when it's done okay so we're making the singapore style rice noodles now and in order to prepare we've taken two tablespoons of sesame oil and we are going to toss the boiled vermicelli in that toss yeah this is really close to something i'm trying toss or flip or whatever you want to call it they got a lot stuck on there so i know we're just gonna deal with it rice noodles so we've got our shrimps that we had to peel and devein even though the package said it was veined they lied okay and then we've prepared here freshly squeezed lime juice one tablespoon and we're gonna put two tablespoons of soy sauce in that once it's cooked we're gonna have to transfer it out and do our vegetables and okay these shrimps are starting to look real good shine some light on that so we're just going to take them out of this container put them back in what we uh right over here there we go and we're going to use this same wok for the vegetables and the noodles okay so for the noodles you actually do need to prepare this beforehand we bought some chicken stock so we took about half a cube and we put it into about a cup of boiling water and now it looks like this so we're going to be using that in this mixture so to start we're going to use the same skillet that we use the prawns in and we are going to throw in the ginger that is mint the ginger and the green chilies okay i don't know those green chilies bell peppers we're gonna let that go for a few seconds before we add the mushrooms and the carrots stir fry you know what i mean you're adding that in we've got the chicken going on the other side there as you can see and then we are going to let it cook for about one minute and we're gonna add curry powder green onions and the stock so be right back okay we threw in our green onions and now we're gonna put in our this is curry powder it's located we found it after a long time of searching in superstore and this brand storage brand curry powder i got a whole container of it which i didn't actually know i had so i already bought some so that'll be taking it back okay looks like that gonna throw in the shrimps and we're gonna the chicken stock needs to go in it will burn out the chicken sauce vegetables so we're here not chicken really we bought the chicken stock yeah you can use vegetable or chicken if you're vegetarian folks you don't need to add the shrimp nor do you need to have the chicken stock you can make this pure vegetarian if you like and this is what it looks like when it's finished and you mix in the noodles does that look delicious okay so what we're doing is lettuce because we're gonna eat the chicken in the lettuce wrap we gotta core the lettuce we have to peel them off one leaf at a time so we're we're working on this it's not very easy would you like to hold the camera oh yes i can actually do this okay so she's gonna core or she's going to peel off each lettuce leaf so we can put our chicken in there and eat it so there you have it chicken wraps with singapore style rice noodles garnished with array of peppers and green onion enjoy
