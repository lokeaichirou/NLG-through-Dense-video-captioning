 please take a moment to uh just quietly read the three words on the blackboard here I'll wait how you feeling you know a few such arrangements are capable of stimulating so much desire so much nostalgia so much saliva and yet for me these words represent disappointment dishonesty and disillusionment that's because whenever and wherever people say they're gonna make you a grilled cheese sandwich what they really mean is they're gonna make you a griddled sandwich containing some melted cheese will not me know when I say grilled cheese sandwich I mean a grilled sandwich containing grilled cheese and here's how I do it you're gonna need a charcoal grill notice here that I've got a large chimney starters worth of charcoal already started and piled up just on one side of the grill yes see I use natural chunk charcoal because I'm well I'm naturally chunky as for the actual ingredients for two sandwiches you're gonna need four half-inch slices a good hearty country-style bread all right you're gonna need some fat for this if you're a butter fan go ahead and spread a little on both sides if however you prefer olive oil hold off until we're just a little bit closer to the fire time as for the cheese I believe that two cheeses are better than none I want sharp but I want nutty too and I want a little spice I want the edges to crust yet I want a high gooeyness factor so I've got three ounces of extra sharp cheddar cheese and 3 ounces of Gruyere and yes I grated them myself and yes I can tell the difference by the way no pre graded back stuff or I'll find out about it I'll be unhappy all right come here a secret weapon is that I add spices all right I stir in a teaspoon of dry mustard 1/2 a teaspoon of smoked paprika and a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper now you could leave any or all of these out but you're not going to and we both know it good now as far as hardware goes I have got my favorite pair of spring-loaded tongs and check this out to grill spatula with minor augmentations I've used my favorite multitasker heavy-duty foil to make them both into shallow trays with just a little bit of lift and here is why because I'm gonna evenly distribute the cheese on both half goes there half goes there I'm gonna spill a little that's the way it goes now put the cheese down off direct heat you want indirect heat on the cheese or it will burn you're gonna have to move this around and shift it several times during the six to nine minutes it's going to take to get nice and bubbly and listen hey hey seriously when this stuff starts bubbling don't look right at it or you will become hypnotized I promise leave that alone let's prep the bread now I do want to go with olive oil so I'm just gonna kind of spritz this down lightly on both sides I don't care if it's perfect coverage you can use a brush if you want to I just like using the spritzer because I hate cleaning brushes that's gonna go over direct heat and here's the the danger the stuff uh could burn so you're gonna have to really keep an eye on it and keep it moving I am NOT going to leave this spot now that the the bread is down see that one's obviously a little warm so we're gonna move it over here alright I'm gonna take that one off and go to the foil that's gonna be per sandwich one I'd say these guys go pretty well together got to move the cheese over and this is a this is gonna be a lot easier and it looks kind of fold down the ellipse a little bit slide on to the sandwich bread goes over and then just wrap that up I'm gonna put this back on the heat just for a couple of minutes indirect heats and direct heat all the way back over here so that the cheese and the bread can kind of get to know each other now let's build this other one out you go that my friends is a grilled sandwich prepared from grilled cheese now I know some of you make a plain that the spatulas actually function as a griddle but you know what and the words of my 13 year old daughter whatever remember America
