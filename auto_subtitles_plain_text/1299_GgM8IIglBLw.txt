 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens budget meals today we're making some beautiful tomato soup now the ingredients cost me $8 for tea and it serves six so per portion it's only gonna cost you a dollar and forty cents so let's get started he's got budget meals Monday what you want Wednesday fast food Friday what else could he share it's Nicko's kitchen where satisfying meals are prepared so the first thing that we want to do guys into a large saucepan I'm going to add some olive oil now the first thing we're going to add guys I've just got some chopped up onion just here I'm just going to add that straight in and I've also got some garlic as well I'm just going to add that to the onion now I'm just planning off the onion and the garlic because we really want to intensify those flavors when we make our soup so over a high heat it should only take about a minute and a half to get that beautiful brown caramelization happening on that onion once you've done that I'm going to add in some fresh tomatoes cut up now you could use canned tomatoes if you wanted to but I find fresh tomatoes work best for this recipe now turning the heat down to a medium heat on the stove just stir in those tomatoes I'm going to garlic together and at this stage I'm going to add in some pepper and season with some salt so what you want to do here guys for the next four to five minutes over a medium heat just keep stirring around and we want those tomatoes to relax and collapse okay we want those juices to ooze out of the tomato and we want them nice and soft so you can see here our tomatoes have started to collapse and now what I'm going to add in is some tomato paste now what the tomato paste does is it just gives it that beautiful red color and also a richness in the soup now to add the liquid to our tomato mixture I'm going to add in some chicken stock now you could use vegetable stock if you wanted to but I do find that the chicken stock gives it a much much better flavor and you can see here guys our soup is slowly starting to come together now the very last thing I'm going to add to our tomato soup is some potatoes okay now what the potatoes will do it will give this a beautiful creamy texture so guys that's all you have to do now over medium to high heat okay we're going to put the lid on the pot and we're going to let this cook for 15 to 20 minutes run till those potatoes have gone nice and soft so let in 15 to 20 minutes on a medium to high heat and boy oh boy this is smelling awesome already so guys I've just taken the lid off and check out that color it looks awesome now right at the end and this is what brings everything together and makes it taste sensational I've got some fresh basil leaves I'm just going to put them in as they are because we're going to blitz this down but just leave the basil leaves in there just let them wilt down for about 5 minutes more on the cooking time so I've just taken off our soup off the heat and for the next part guys you're going to need a hand Blitzer just like that now if you don't have one of these you could put this in the blender but be very careful because the mixture is very very hot so what I want you to do straight in because we're going to be just creaming together those potatoes because they're still whole just very slowly mix it all together like that and just blitz those potatoes down so that's what you're after guys this beautiful creamy thick tomato soup let's serve this bad boy up and just to finish it off guys over the top just a bit of presentation I'm going to finish it off with a little bit more of that fresh basil so guys it looks sensational it smells sensational and I tell you what it's going to taste sensational as well so let's get stuck in just look how thick that is guys that's exactly what you're after with a soup so let's get stuck in beautiful the clean flavors and what I mean by clean it's fresh it's vibrant the basil that fresh tomato oh that is great that is so awesome it's healthy it's cheap and it tastes phenomenal guys please give this a go it is awesome all the ingredients are below so check it out you guys take care and if you're watching tomorrow we're making chocolate cake on Nico's bakery so make sure you check that channel out otherwise I'll see you back here on Wednesday for what you want Wednesday so until then take care
