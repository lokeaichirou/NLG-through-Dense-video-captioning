 I can't think of a better example of the French influence on Vietnamese food than the Bondi sandwich thin crusted baguette braised meats pickled vegetables fresh herbs all in one sandwich in this video I'm going to show you one my favorite bond me with sweet and savory red cooked pork the first step for this bond meat is to make a red cooked pork this is the southern Chinese technique of cooking pork in soy sauce and spices we have a 1 pound piece of pork shoulder cut into two pieces dark soy sauce light soy sauce these are really the ingredients that give it the color hence the term red cooking Chinese rice wine two sticks of cinnamon and some star anise three pieces lastly I'm going to add enough water just to cover the pork after that all I need to do is bring it up to a boil as it comes up to a boil I want to make sure the pork is submerged if it isn't I'll just add a little bit of water to make sure it is covered then I want to skim off any of the phone then we'll lower this to a simmer for about an hour until it's nearly tender one other element of the sandwich that needs a little advance prep is our carrot and daikon pickles no need to cook them really simple to make first thing I'm going to start with is plain old distilled vinegar 1/2 cup of that then 1/2 cup of granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt to list that a bit you really don't need to whisk it until it's dissolved then next I'll add my carrot and daikon the carrot and daikon julienne could be cut by hand or with a mandolin I just need to give it a stir now after these are stirred I like to marinate them for at least 30 minutes but really no longer than 24 hours if you see there's still some granulated sugar just come back and start in about 20 minutes and it'll be fine after the pork has been simmering an hour I want to test for doneness what I like to do is give it a little push it to be firm but it should be able to be peeled back a little bit now that I've checked that it's tender enough I'm going to add my sugar I don't add the sugar too early because the sugar can pull the moisture out and cause the meat to be tough give that a stir to dissolve the sugar I want to cool it in the liquid so it stays moist and succulent then I'm going to add six tablespoons of the pork simmering liquid to the measuring cup two tablespoons of fish sauce I'm going to use that to season the sandwich at the very end now the carrots and daikon have picked up that pickling mixture I'm going to drain them get rid of most of the liquid a few drops is okay it actually seasons the sandwich now that the meats cool let's slice it get it ready for the sandwich take that slice into thin strips you can see it's got that red hue on the outside from the soy sauce inside is cooked through so now I've got everything ready let's make the sandwich starting with a light thin crusted baguette a spy scent and a half lengthwise leaving the spine intact first thing some mayonnaise the mayonnaise I tend to spread on the top half okay second is my pate the pate I did add some butter too so it was spreadable so it's nice and soft that goes on the bottom now this I'm making one sandwich here the recipe makes two and I'll make one there you have it so we've got our Mayo our pate next I'm going to add my lettuce leaves vietname sandwiches don't have a lot of filling I took the tip of the Greenleaf lettuce and pulled those off and here next the pickled vegetables which have been drained with most of their liquid that comes down the center notice the pickled veggies is a fair amount of them they're really a seasoning in here cucumbers less of the cucumber than the julienned vegetables the pickled ones the shave scallions very light with the scallions sprigs the cilantro the whole sprigs not just the leaves some of the tender stems are fine jalapeno slices any chili will do those are evenly distributed and they get no really spicy bites and then lastly the pork place that in here single layer and spread them out make sure to fill up the whole sandwich with that fill in any gaps and lastly I'm gonna add a sprinkling of the simmering mixture which is a mix with the fish sauce I want to use four tablespoons of that the sandwich is complete as it is but if you can find it pork flosses it's called which is cooked pork which has been pounded and shaved and sometimes fried it's a great accompaniment to it salty roasted in flavor and a little bit crispy so now that the first sandwich is assembled let's cut this and put it on the platter and there it is the Vietnamese sandwich sweet and salty spicy crispy everything all in one sandwich I'm saving this last one for me Wow everything comes together in one bite it's like a party in your mouth
