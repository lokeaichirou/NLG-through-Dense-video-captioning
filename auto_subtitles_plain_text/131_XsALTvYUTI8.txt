 hi friends is Rosie and in this video I'm going to show you how I make my stove top macaroni and cheese at any time that you want the exact measurements for this recipe visit my blog I heart recipes calm I'm going to start off with my elbow macaroni pasta as you can see or if you can't tell I'm using large macaronis but you can use regular size I have some they'll be the cheese that I cubed up you're going to need a couple tablespoons of salted butter in this bowl here I have some sharp cheddar cheese that I shred it up you're going to need some water and that is not the exact measurement here I have some half in half and whenever I use half and half people ask me what it is well this is what it says on the outside of the carton and if you turn it around it says milk and cream sauce half milk half cream if you can't find this in the store you can use part milk and part cream but in this pan or my saucepan I'm going to start pouring in my water and the half-and-half followed by these two ingredients I'm going to grab my elbow macaroni pasta and I'm going to add it into the saucepan as well you can use regular as sized elbows if you want I'm just going to give everything a nice little stir just to make sure that the pasta is nicely emerged into the liquid and now I'm going to turn the heat up to medium-high let it start to bubble just like that I'm not going to start adding in the butter and I'm going to let it melt completely and then I'll add in my Velveeta cheese we're going to continue to cook this mac and cheese until the pasta is nice and al dente and that means until it is nicely cooked but still firmed and not overcooked so once you have a cheese sauce like this and your pasta is pretty much good to go you're going to start adding in your shredded cheese and then you're going to fold it in until everything is nice and combined and all that cheddar cheese is nicely melted as this is the finished look you are ready to serve this is so easy and I think it took me like 20 minutes 25 minutes at most so now I'm going to survey and when I do serve this mac and cheese since it's a really quick and easy dinner I just like to keep everything really simple and I usually serve it with a side salad and by the way you can freeze this I like to make a nice big batch of this and then I eat some now and then we say the rest for later so yeah definitely feel free to turn this into a freezer meal keep this in mind during the holidays if you're one of those people that like to cook things in advance and just warm it up on the day of so now I'm just going to label my container by the way I got that from the Dollar Tree and that is it thank you so much for watching I truly appreciate it don't forget to comment rate and subscribe if you haven't already and visit me every Sunday and Wednesdays for new video uploads
