 this week I made a vegan version of one of my favorite Korean dishes this is beef in map or in this case vegan bap I'm gonna show you how to do it right now on the aimless cook bibimbap takes a lot of prep but you can make extra ahead of time and have enough for whenever you get a craving we're gonna start with about 10 to 12 dried shiitakes and reconstitute them in a bowl with boiling water to cover when they're done drain and squeeze out the excess moisture with a kitchen paper then slice them discarding the woody stems put the slices in a small saucepan with two tablespoons each of soy sauce Xiao Qing cooking wine and brown sugar add a splash of hot water and stir it up to get things going on medium heat and simmer it until the liquid is absorbed when that's done take it off the heat and set aside and take a bunch of fresh spinach washed and rinsed and blanch in boiling salted water for about 30 seconds my shocked it in cold water drain and squeeze out the excess moisture put into a large mixing bowl and season with soy and sesame oil add a pinch of salt to taste garnish with sesame seeds and then set aside Kay let's start with our gochujang sauce in a mixing bowl combine a teaspoon of sesame oil with a tablespoon of gochujang and a teaspoon of soy sauce to that add a teaspoon and a half of honey and a splash of hot water whisk it together to combine and give it a taste it should be spicy at this point but will balance out when combined with all of the other ingredients add some sesame seeds mix well and then let's make our cilantro garlic sauce now normally the sauce isn't in a traditional bibimbap but I like it so in a food processor or blender add 1/2 a bunch of fresh cilantro in a tablespoon of roasted garlic puree and I can check out how I made this by clicking on the link in the annotation - that put in the juice of one lime and blend to a nice pace when you have your paste keep blending on low speed and slowly drizzle in a quarter cup of canola oil til you have yourself a nice emulsion season with a pinch of salt and then set aside now we just need to lightly stir fry some julienne carrots and fresh sprouts separately in a little bit of sesame oil you only need to cook them for about 30 seconds now you can easily make this with either ground pork or beef but today we're gonna use some smoked tofu to make it vegan now simply you dice it and stir-fry briefly to heat through now let's move on to the assembly start with a nice big bowl you're gonna need room to mix everything together when you serve put in a couple scoops of steamed rice and then drizzle the gochujang sauce and cilantro garlic sauce on each side after that assemble the vegetables on top arranging neatly like a clock keep an eye on your colors and keep everything vibrant lastly put your protein in this case our tofu in the center and then top with more gochujang sauce and sesame seeds now when you're ready to eat simply mix everything together and enjoy very hard incredibly colorful delicious hmm so take this recipe with you make it yours and have fun in the kitchen which brings me to my question of the day what is your favorite vegetarian dish let me know in the comments down below and we'll see you next time I'm taking over again
