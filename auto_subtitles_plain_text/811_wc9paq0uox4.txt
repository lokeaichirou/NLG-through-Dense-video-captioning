 hey everybody dr. Pedram shojai founder of well.org and the editor of Bmore magazine here with a fermentation assume our Bock a dear friend and going to show us some wonderful things to do with food add some life to it and make it super food so we're going to just make some sauerkraut today really simple and the exciting thing about this is that all you need here is cabbage onion dill caraway and salt so first of all you're going to core the cabbage always just take out the center there hey we're just going to try to shred this and keep it a very a fairly even texture all right chop up some onion okay the reason I use onion is because it has prebiotics in it it has inulin so it's going to help this to ferment faster but it also a lot of times it guarantees that this is going to work alright so now I'm just going to chop up some dill dill just makes it taste delicious so it's going to add a lot of flavor to your sauerkraut all right so we have the vegetables chopped up and in here and we're going to add some spices you can use any spices we're gonna use caraway because it is a really traditional sauerkraut spice and then we're going to add salt I know salt is important you want to make sure that you are using a non-iodized sea salt right iodine is a disinfectant we don't want to use that in here so I have Celtic sea salt here but you can use like the Himalayan pink sea salt you can use any of these and we're going to add for this but we're probably just going to add about a tablespoon or so generally the rule is three to four tablespoons per gallon of sauerkraut okay so that's a gallon with it all packed in there we're doing about a quart today so we're going to fill it up into here this is about a quart so we want to use I'm saying like one tablespoon one and a half tablespoons you want it to taste as salty as a Lay's potato chip and so you just want to mix it and you're really just get trying to get the salt to touch all the veggies here and so that's going to take the water out of the vegetables and into this solution and I'll show you how this light creates the brine I don't add water when I make sauerkraut mmm so it's going to be a little bit more potent than your normal sauerkraut that's been watered down essentially it's gonna be sour and delicious so that's all the water you need because you're pulling it out of the cabbage yeah and this is why you want to use fresh organic produce because it's filled with all this water and that's what we're trying to use to create the bride all right so let's see here Gooden I can I mean I don't know if you can see it glistening all right like the salt is already starting to get this okay so when you're trying to make good sauerkraut you want to make it taste good here right now pounding it in there you're getting it kind of jammed in there as much as you can right well I want to get all the air bubbles out I see so I really want to push this down here I want to smash all of the cabbage in here as tightly as possible so that the air bubbles are gone we're starting to see some of the water mm-hmm gurgle through here yeah you see that yeah so that's gonna form our bride so essentially let me just kind of show you the stages now so what you're gonna do is you're gonna fill this up you want to leave at least an inch in the top maybe an inch and a half two inches and that's going to just really keep it from overflowing because for the first week it's gonna be incredibly active so what's really interesting is we didn't add a starter if you notice just the vegetables and the salt and the bacteria that are living on this cabbage right now and the bacteria probably on my hands you know as I smash this down in here are the bacteria that are going to inoculate and start growing now that we've created this anaerobic environment so the way that I do it I like these jars because they're really easy you don't really want to clamp it all the way down you just leave it like this right so the air can like basically like flow out the carbon dioxide can flow out as it ferments but you don't have a lot of stuff from your kitchen and your house flying in right so that's how we want to leave it this is one that has been going for a few days right so I want you to just notice the difference in these two this was this a few days ago yep and so one thing is that it's really really juicy I mean there's that in aerobic environment this will bubble for the first week and if you look see how it's like starting to get more translucent like just notice that a lot of the white parts of the cabbage have changed it's starting to starting to break down a little bit mm-hmm and that's what the bacteria do just in a few days huh yeah just in a few days Wow I usually let this go for probably two to four weeks I've open like this like this mm-hmm and then this starts to happen yeah you let it I let it pick it going two to four weeks yep and then at four weeks is when I take it out I taste it and make sure it's good and I put it in the refrigerator and at that point I will clamp this down so this one has been going for about one week and again you can tell like this cabbage it's more translucent look it's changed like from the green it's getting a little bit more yellow and this one's sour it's delicious many people are gonna want to eat it now and that's fine you just clamp it down put in your fridge it's good to go okay so look you could eat this you need anything down mine right so at any point along the spectrum it's all edible but you want it to get to that magic moment this one's been going for three weeks so this one's delicious right again totally different color translucent you can almost like see there's no more white modeling like there is another one and yeah go for it mm-hmm right and so what's changed is this has gotten more sour and that sour flavor is the lactic acid so as you ferment you basically are letting these bacteria create lactic acid and carbon dioxide interesting so the food it blocks out the foodborne pathogens but then the good healthy bugs that made this party happen are still there and then when we eat it they come in to us right so you're getting the benefit of both you're getting this you know this action where it prevents foodborne pathogens from growing right so inside your body it's actually going to help get rid of any bad organisms that you don't want living there and you're bringing in the healthy bacteria unless you're in the good guys right on yeah so you guys you saw the recipe here we'll add it to wherever you're seeing this so you can follow through with this some are how do people find you some herb accom is the best place to find me I also have a free gift on there for the top food that I recommend obviously might be sauerkraut but you should check that out if you want to learn how to shop for the right kind of raw unpasteurized sauerkraut awesome guys fermentation missed summer Bach I think that that's the coolest title in the world I love your card thank you
