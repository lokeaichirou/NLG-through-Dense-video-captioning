 hi I'm Diane cometa and today on dish you would die I'm going to show you how to make corn dogs these are a carnival and fair favorite and they're so easy to make so let's get started I'm dishing what died so who ever thought you can make corn dogs at home it's pretty easy actually so what I have here is some cornmeal and I'm just leveling this off and make it a little bit of a mess and I'm going to put this into a large mixing bowl along with about the same amount of flour so we're just going to pour this in so you want to measure them in the same way and then just level it off and put that into your bowl as well so you have those two things and what we're doing here is we're making a nice batter that outside coating of the corn dog which is sort of like a corn muffin and with that we're going to have some leavening to make it kind of like puff up a little bit and that's going to be some baking powder so go ahead and add that into your mixture and it needs salt so we have a nice you know balance of flavor and I like to use a fine sea salt for this and it's always nice to have a little bit of sugar in there so I like to just use a little bit a little bit more and then go ahead and grab yourself a nice big fat whisk and whisk that all together and get it really mixed through thoroughly now grab yourself some milk and then an egg put that together and then grab your same whisk pop that in there and just get that combined and then take that wet mixture and dump it right into the dry mixture just like this really super simple and that's it for the batter now mix this through until it gets nice and smooth and thoroughly combined now you're just going to let this rest for about thirty minutes at room temperature and that's going to give it a chance to come up to room temperature it's going to give the flour and the cornmeal a chance to absorb the milk and the egg and it's going to give the gluten a chance to relax because by mixing it like that we kind of activated the gluten so we don't want little tough corndogs we want them to be nice and tender so we're just going to let this sit and while we do that we're going to get our hot dogs ready now you're going to need some all-beef hot dogs or the hot dog of your choice so I took them out of the package I ran them under some water and then I patted them dry thoroughly because you want them to be nice and dry so that the batter sticks to them so the first thing you want to do is get some bamboo skewers and you want to take the hotdog and put it right into the center so slide that all the way up there and then just do that to each one once the batter has been resting for about 15 minutes pour some oil into a frying pan with high sides I'm using a 10-inch pan here and you want to get it about an inch high heat that oil up till it reaches about 350 degrees then you want to grab yourself a nice big tall glass or a jar and you're going to pour the batter into it grab your hot dogs and take a little bit of flour and put that on the plate with the hot dogs and just lightly coat them with the flour and the is going to help the batter stick to them brush off any excess and take each hotdog and place it into the batter and give it a nice turn around and get it nice and coated let any excess dribble off and carefully place it into the hot oil and only cook about 2 to 3 hotdogs at a time use a pair of tongs to carefully rotate the dogs so that they Brown evenly and cook them for about 3 minutes when they're done carefully use your tongs and remove them from the oil and place them on a plate lined with some paper towels to drain and to cool and you can either serve them with a side of your favorite condiment like I like yellow mustard or even some barbecue sauce or you can just take some mustard and just swirl that right over it you take your dog for a walk and it's absolutely delicious just like at the carnival so let's give this baby a bite lightly crisp on the outside it's got that nice corn muffin taste a little bit sweet a little bit crisp just perfect go and make these get the recipe dish it with DICOM and I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious doh see you next time bye bye you
