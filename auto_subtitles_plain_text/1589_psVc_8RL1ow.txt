 hey guys so just down in Calgary a little while ago visiting my friends and one of my best friends asked me um how to make yakisoba so this video is dedicated to you Marvin except whenever I'm in yakisoba I always use Moodle noodles so this is actually gonna be yucky you don't and yeah I'm also going to include a link to another video where I'm gonna meet um Jackie Silva on a hot dog kind of like the Japadog that you see in Vancouver so yeah you guys are in just like just keep on watching [Music] so for the yakisoba sauce you can either make it yourself which I'll show you how to do it or you can go to your local Asian store like TMT and buy and yakisoba sauce I just went today and I bought this to see the sauce that I made actually taste is similar and it does so what you need is two tablespoons of soy sauce two and a half tablespoons I wish this here 1/2 a tablespoon of sugar half a teaspoon of midden half a tablespoon of sake and I added actually um half a teaspoon of beef stock mix and some hot chili oil and this you don't really need to add this I added two tablespoons of this to kind of make the sauce a little bit milder if you don't have this you don't need to add it the wishes here is pretty much the main flavors so I actually know what add this it makes it a little milder and it tastes a lot better so that is what we need for the sauce and it should come out like this so the first thing you want to do is just cook your chicken [Music] now I initially wanted to use Forks but when I went to TMZ to have any of the life stories that I usually use for other services so I didn't want to find competent so I'm just using chicken so I just took off the chicken and now I'm just going to add in some onions oh when I forgot to say add a white pepper and salt to the chicken as seasoning and you can just do the same with the other vegetables now just add the garlic and the mushrooms [Music] and just cook until the vegetables are tender so I'm just going to add in the bean sprouts [Music] I'm going to add in the noodles which I already precooked now you can use any kind of noodles you like either gone or the yakisoba noodles and then just for lips like the chicken what we didn't need all that sauce but um just cook it a little bit more and it should be right to eat you guys so this is what it looks like efforts being cooked just as a note the sauce that I made and what I showed you wasn't the actual amount I've already used it from another dish also I was watching TV so please do not add all of that sauce all you need is just a little bit just to flavor it please do not add all of the sauce and so just to finish this dish all we need is some now you can add mail if you like you can add Japanese Mayo oh dear God and then all you need is some our naughty and some cuts off just in the middle some naughty some green onions and some Vinny shoka and that is how I made yakisoba whoopsie so leave a comment guys and tell me how you like this dish obviously you can use the prepackaged yakisoba seasoning but um I kind of like trying to make my own sauce so tell me how you like this sauce and yeah just leave a comment alright official taste tester please please taste this [Music] once again great is it is this yucky tone good enough to take to work I take it anywhere [Music] very good [Music]
