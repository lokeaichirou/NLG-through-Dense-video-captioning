 if you're cooking a burger and you're actually using a frozen patty like that and on top of it you're using some prepackaged buns you're doing it all wrong if you think you make it easy on yourself and actually using a frozen burger at home especially if you're coming home after busy day I think it's so wrong I even have a hard time touching it not even thing out cooking it that freezin burn that completely dry they're probably grinding that two years ago and that's what you're ending up in your house so of course now if you're not going for the frozen one you're thinking probably doing the right thing and actually buying some fresh ground meat for example the one that I have right here it's nice bright red very fresh but it's extra lean there's no fat in it no fat no flavor it's a boring burger never seasoned the meat ahead of time because what the salt actually does to the burger it starts on curing the meat the texture is not the same you are ruining your burger another big mistake do not overheat and heat the skillet if you end up eat the pan and you put actually the burger into the oil it will not C R therefore the burger doesn't seal and you will lose the juices from the burger if you overheat the pan and you put the burger down that burger will never cook not even to the medium rare or medium side the outside will be already burnt never toss the bun too early because they only get stale and rubbery and the finally steak that I see people doing is cooking this burgers and then really pushing it down on the grill and what you're actually doing there is squeezing out all the juices from the burger the result you're ending up with a thin patty very dry on a soggy bun that's so wrong now I'm going to show you the right way how to do the best burger first of all you have to pick the freshest meat fat in a burger is so important because not only it adds flavor to the burger but also it adds that moistness look for some coarsely grind meat or buy a piece of meat and go to the extra work actually we slice it by hand always think about using a nice piece of chuck or maybe some strip steak and then of course the ultimate would be then the Kobe beef where really is the highest in fat content and as you make your patty the adventures really think a little bit out of the box mixing some ingredients into that brown meat for example some soaked mustard seeds some fresh herbs some sauteed and mushrooms when you're shaping the burger always use a little bit of water on your hand so first of all the burger and the meat doesn't stick on your fingers and you perfectly can shape that burger stuffing that burger either with a little bit of blue cheese or really is going to work really well or what I like to do also having a little bit of leftover short ribs for example I put the short ribs in the center of the burger that brings like the burger two to four different another level don't even think on using olive oil use some canola oil oil who really supports nicely that lead and how do you know that actually your pan is really to the right temperature is when the oil smokes slightly so searing the burner is probably the most important step you put the burger in the oil Sirian means you seal it and by sealing it means all the juices are staying inside think about cooking it like a steak before serving it let it rest a little bit so that the juices inside the steak or the burger are distributed evenly now comes the fun part actually assembling a burger so you're standing with a bun always toss the bun or the last moment that's how you get really the bread showing at its best and what I like really is picking a bun like ciabatta for example which has a nice golden crust on top of it think about using a little pesto you can use the freshest tomatoes of course but you're really layering it up you can push it to using a little bit of sheer pineapple you can use the caramelized onions so really the layers are endless if you do all the steps right you will end up with the ultimate burn
