 hello and welcome to another session of Yasin's cookery show today I want to show you how to make rotis so we're going to begin by adding only water to a pound of wholemeal flour and then stir the mixture together add a pinch of salt and then knead the dough if the dough feels dry add some water and finally add some oil ok the door is now smooth and elastic and is ready to be rolled out so I'm not going to make small balls so we'll take a bit of dog this squeeze it in my hands and then just roll it out into a smooth ball like this I'm going to dip the piece of dough into some flour and then place it on the Chokey so you start rolling it out and you must make sure you roll it out evenly on all sides and form a nice circle okay once the roti is 6 inches wide and 2 millimeters thick we're now going to add the roti onto the hot pan you will begin to see brown specks appearing on the other side of the roti so I turn this over like this not yet like chance for you ok so I'll turn it over now and you can see the brown specks I'm going to set up logon and we'll turn walk around it's going to be a hot pan because otherwise the water would rise you'll see in a bit okay number of turns over so you see those brown specks now just will push down the sides you can see the water rising me to do that that that is almost coaching right so that is done look at that risen beautifully guys a freshly cooked roti look at that and that can be put into the plane like this and the reason why it rose so so much was because earlier I did a good job in kneading the dough my goodness smells delicious another I've shown you how easy it is to make I'm sure you give this a try to you thank you
