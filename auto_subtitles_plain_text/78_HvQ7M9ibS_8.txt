 [Music] Salaam alaikum and namaste welcome back to another session with wash eff at Wawa calm today we are going to learn how to knead dough and make chapatis wild rice is most widely eaten staple diet in southern part of India chapati is more popular in north and rest of South Asia chapati is known popularly as Indian bread it goes equally well with cooked lentils non-vegetarian curries and vegetarian curries and it adds dietary fiber to the meals which is very healthy let us learn the process of making chapatis chapatis are made out of course wheat flour usually with salt and water but with other floors they gain individuality you can use all kinds of flours like barley flour cornmeal or millet flour for different kinds of chapatis chapatis can come in many shapes and variations the most common is flat ground but you can make triangles or layer triangles called Piratas organize all your ingredients whole wheat flour water oil salt in one place so that you're not running around later with flour cover hands you can consider adding yogurt milk if you wish to make the dough all you need to do is add pinch of salt and water make a small well pour water goes slowly on adding your water usually it takes around 55% of the flour let's say if you are using 100 grams of flour you will take around 55 ml of water the secret to really soft Japanese lies in kneading the dough must be smooth and just the right softness which is medium add water or yogurt as required and continue to knead till you get the right consistency just wipe the walls with wet dough and that takes away any extra flour I like to make the dough soft because that produces soft chappathis after you have kneaded the dough add few drops of oil adding oil at this stage is optional but I have found the results in a very smooth dough and soft chapathis i knead the dough in such a way it is soft and slightly sticky that is a secret to make a very soft chapati after I do that I sprinkle little amount of flour and make baked into a ball and let it rest for 15-20 minutes after resting for 15 minutes make soft balls of the dough apply little flour onto your hands if the dough is sticky now let's learn how to roll it chopping all it is add little extra flour as if you are rolling any bread and then use a rolling pin use a circular motion to make it round if you see make sure the dough moves by itself easily if it is not happening if it is sticking add little more flour to it okay this is how you roll it's a body after your roll just tap the chapati in your hand so any extra flour comes out then put your chapati on a really hot griddle and let it cook for around 30 seconds and turn it to the other side and then rotate it a little bit this also gives it even cooking and when you see these bubbles that means it's it's getting cooked the process of pressing gives even color so if some areas is not touching the pan correctly you pressing this gives even color so when it is curved on one side turn it to the other side at this point of time you may choose to add some butter or I prefer to use clarified butter which is called Desi Ghee and I I love to add a little butter on it and if you see how it is popping up that is the best way to cook a chapati so this is how you make a choppa when you remove support ease from the hot griddle put some ghee and serve immediately if possible if you are making chapatis beforehand place chapatis one above the other and wrap it in a clock or napkins so they don't get hard I hope you have enjoyed today's session of chapati making and learn from it remember that whatever is all about inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes cooking videos and cooking tips so others may benefit from your cooking [Music]
