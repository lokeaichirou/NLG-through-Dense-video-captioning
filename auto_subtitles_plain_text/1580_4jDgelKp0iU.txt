 okay hi everyone hi girls I'm gonna toot today I'm going to teach you how to make turbo game it's actually same recipes as you will make type II everybody has a different way of cooking but I still like to marinate the way how i marinate the p√§ivi you can always have carrots and round onions and stuff but you want the meat to be really tender and really juicy so main ingredients this is a meat I have two or three pounds a thing is not sliced meat when you go to Asian grocery store they sell them like this all the time and I have big round onion I'm going to be using half for the marinade and I'm going to be using half when you cook we're going to slice this on the side and so my daughters can pick out she loves to eat the round onion the grilled wild onion so I'm making that um green onion it's a winter so which means you know it's fully skinny I have some ginger ginger is healthy for you and some garlic and as always is I'm using 7up because it has a sugar and everything so but and really makes them equally tender so first thing I'm going to be doing is I'll be slicing the round onion cut them in cube and I'm gonna put them in my food processor or the chopper and Oh swallow this why is it so slippery okay green onion that will probably going to be about a cup when you put them in a little container so I'm not even gonna bother to do that you could always add more round onion so wrong tell you what it does with it is it kind of longer if I have sorry it's hard to get changing right you don't have to make it really pretty to chop it so put them in their minds always liquidy the garlic I would say this is going to be about a 1 tablespoon teaspoon 2 tablespoon I'm just gonna put them in there yeah that looks about T 1/2 tablespoon to and the garlic 5 6 pieces but I don't know how much that would be I would say about a tablespoon okay um I'm gonna brine you're supposed to puree this so okay put all that in there now if you have Asian pear you could put that I don't have one and I usually don't put them anyways so 7up does the job okay now we're going to be adding soy sauce I'm gonna put one cup cup soy sauce and the sesame oil I'm putting in 1 tbsp black pepper about a teaspoon if you don't like it spicy go now okay just ah we have a fly can you believe a fly catcher one of them does not get when you went to throw trash this is a teaspoon so I'm gonna add a teaspoon of meeting you don't have that's fine too 7-up put about 1/2 cup and a half of stepping up from here see what it does bubbly we're going to add sugar I have a half cup here mix it all then now taste now Precog is sweet so you want to taste the marinade to make sure it's sweet mine is a little bit sweet not too sweet you like a sweeter you could add more what we're going to do is I'm going to put this in here and we're going to marinate this mix everything up okay so just mix it well and what we're going to do is I'm going to put this in a little container and we're going to put them in a refrigerator and it tastes better about an hour later you could eat it now if you're hungry and this will serve probably a street pal so six people well maybe not okay so it's all marinated doggies okay show them how we normally eat fish yes that's me oil that we're gonna spring uh-huh this is large so it's like for us into the like life compared to the dinner plate yeah and this is um the romaine lettuce is what is it called hard but we'll make notices up at the phone Oh hard this like romaine hearts cuz look how cute it is see it's like a little we're gonna wrap the blue boogie and that's the cooking that I marinated it yeah we're not really fancy kind of people we just throw it off the plastic thing and to be kinky silly a salt and and now okay I'm gonna hurt and we're gonna be adding yeah my daughter's don't like to eat wall garlic oh we just put the garlic whatever vegetable you wanna eat it with we just throw them all here and that yeah yeah start with that yeah I don't do too much Sally baby system or oil looks dry now do this long side and cook your best friend grant here J -
