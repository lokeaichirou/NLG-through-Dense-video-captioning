 making a shrimp pad thai so like all great Asian dishes particularly Thai we're gonna start with a sauce and in order to get going here we're just gonna boil up a few things to start with I have 3/4 of a cup of tamarind juice now tamarind juice is something that I have noticed you can find more and more and more in the supermarket I used to eat the spiced tamarind candies but they saw them all like the Caribbean markets which basically like sour and sweet taste it and describe what you think it tastes like 1/4 of a cup of soy sauce you know what it tastes like it's like a slightly more sour and sweeter apple juice you know what maybe you should use apple juice and put a little squeeze of lime in it if you can't find tamarind juice basically you're just doing a little bit of liquid that's a little sweet and a little sour I think that's a good idea 1/3 of a cup of palm sugar which we were looking at before it's a cool little disc and it's an interesting sweetener and kalter chopped it up for me you could use 1/3 a cup of brown sugar I'm just showing you some of the authentic flavors here that I've discovered I have fish sauce here which I keep all the time in my fridge and it's a little bit less than a third of a cup you want to get in there and if you don't have fish sauce I always say just thin out some soy sauce because it's a little salty yes there's a flavor there that's really unique but anyway if you don't have it that's what you can do and then of course calder because it's us we're up there's some of your peanut sauce probably probably is mine knowing knowing my you dink habits ok one teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce and we just get this going and let it heat up on the stove and that's gonna be the basis for when we start cooking our shrimp pad thai in the wok we're gonna need this sauce to put in that's what gives it that Jimmy it's gonna be like the sauce that tastes like the pad thai we all know that's right now to get ready for our pad thai of course noodles are the key so I have rice sticks here which don't get boiled the way regular noodles do you just put about 8 ounces of them into a bowl and then you need to take water that is not boiling anymore but it's quite hot and you just pour it over top and then you soak those noodles and once they're soaked they're ready to be put in the wok with everything else and at the end they'll have perfect texture this is fried tofu but you could use an extra tofu if you don't have fried tofu although it is at a lot of Asian specialty shops so if you can get that done kaulder I'm gonna start with the wok action which means you have to have everything ready so I'm gonna actually just finish cutting up the rest of my scallion here and we want it in about two inch pieces and if you've ever had shrimp pad thai from your takeout store you'll see it seems a little bit strange to cut it like that but that's exactly how it looks so I'm just gonna cut this and I have my wok over here which is getting as flaming Li hot as I can get it and I've cut here a bunch of about three or four shallots and I'm putting them in two piles and you'll see why in a second and be careful over there and pay attention over here because you're gonna want to make this yourself when I'm not around to just cook it for you or I can't order it yeah you could order it in but hopefully this is gonna be way better than that so I go in here with a good half a cup of safflower okay so a lot of oil a lot of safflower or peanut oil but in this case I'm gonna use safflower oil and Ingo beautiful beautiful shallots the first thing I'm doing with these shallots it's just getting them golden and fried so we want these to just be golden and they're almost there and wok cooking involves a lot of in and out if you want to do it right I mean you just keep throwing stuff in the wok means it just steams before it really cooks so I've got a plate here so I can just keep getting stuff in and out okay this looks good so I want to leave behind the oil and I want to just bring everything cooked out of the wok and just see how nice and crispy it's gonna be all right now into here goes all of those scallion that I cut the rest of the shallot and calder our shrimp which we peeled and we left the tail on and it's a pound of medium shrimp you just get that right in there oh that's really starting to smell good doesn't that smell great all right now depending on where you're getting pad thai you can get chicken pad thai or you can get shrimp or a lot of time this both chicken and shrimp in it when you don't have a ton of ton of heat which in a restaurant they'd have a lot more heat I leave it here for one second - just get cooked let's see how you're doing over here Oh beautiful on the tofu that's just beautifully cut now would you mind call they're just taking four of the eggs and I'll be all ready then if you whisk them sure all right this looks like it's cooked on one side I'm gonna stir-fry it which is what the idea is and you get all the aromatics in there you can start to see how the scallion breaks down and the shallot brings so much flavor to it and we basically need to cook this until the shrimp is cooked through before we move on to the next stage and that's a really important thing about wok cooking you just don't want to just cram a bunch of stuff in the wok because otherwise it just steams before it gets a nice coating on it hey you stressed that to me so much with wok cooking and with any high heat cooking in general yeah and you know what it was hard for you guys to understand when I would make like Thai fried rice and I'd only make it in batches so that it was perfect and we would never make him out he'd never make enough and I'd be just making batches I'd I wouldn't even get to a batch for myself before one of the four of them would want another batch and I don't blame them because Thai fried rice is amazing all right we're getting there you got that stun you've got your tofu done it looks like this is ready to come out and you can then just throw in the tofu so I always just have a plate standing nearby to receive all of the stuff that's already cooked and again it's okay if we leave behind just a little bit of stuff okay so why don't you put that tofu in there beautiful all right so we really just want to cook this until it's completely heated through on both sides and it's got a little of the patina from the wok my friend who taught me a lot about wok cooking said you want a little bit of the taste of the wok in your food okay kaulder at this point if you can dream those noodles that's gonna be the last thing we do after we finish with our eggs they'll be all ready to go these rice sticks have been soaking for about thirty minutes just to soften them this is beautifully cooked so this can come out these noodles ready to go in there not yet I have one more thing to do and that is I just want to cook the eggs first and those will take no time at all but now everything can just get it kind of piled right up in there okay and go with the eggs well just let that cook for a sec I'm gonna turn off the sauce here this is plenty warm and this is just like scrambled eggs you can see it goes it gets right away it just starts to cook mmm I love this part of the Pad Thai and I love I loved wok cooking because you know it's like you got to get the layers of flavor you really can see how you add the layers exams like it it's like real and you just got to make sure you get everything off the bottom okay so these are a little bit wet I'm gonna get everything out here when I say what you don't have to cook the eggs completely so we'll get all of that out onto our plate and you know what I'm not gonna worry so much about leaving a little bit of the egg behind because right into this pot goes our sauce that we made and so I'm gonna just let me just get one second to lift up the eggs that are around the edges it's still got all got the grape flavor just mix it around a little bit and when you know you're gonna have liquid going in there doesn't matter because it picks up all the little bits in go our noodles I've done would you mind putting the rest of the cooked shrimp and tofu an egg right back in here carefully and while I was busy putting everything together in the wok kalter actually got all our condiments ready which is a wonderful thing because this dish is just it's amazing like this but it's beautiful with all the condiments so if you give me a bowl I will serve each of us a dish so I'm so excited and then we have our fried shallots that we're gonna put on top and at this point I'm going to turn off my wok cuz everything's done I'll give you I know you probably want there you go make sure that you get some tofu I keep giving you all the shrimp I'm sure you don't mind that at all okay mmm I'm sorry you're gonna get a little messy all right I think that's good for me to start with and then we can take it down and go eat trying to grab the shallots should I put another platter full no you know what maybe I'll just do put this whole thing on the platter cuz if I know you you're gonna want more than I gave you we have our amazing fried shallots and there we go Pad Thai we've already eaten up all of our beef satay so it's time to sit down and I can't just stress enough about when you're eating Thai food especially in a restaurant or you see photographs of Thai food in Thailand it's all about the condiments I'm gonna put some bean sprouts I'm squeezing a lime I'm putting some extra peanuts and some cilantro thanks for watching hungry for more click here for more great recipes and to subscribe click here check back every week for more craveable recipes leave a comment
