 I'm here at Islands restaurants in Redondo Beach California where we're going to learn how to make their signature Hawaiian burger join us on get the dish and find out the secrets behind the signature recipes of famous eateries and how you can recreate them at home islands restaurants was founded in 1982 by tony to grazier with a philosophy of recreating that carefree feeling after spending a day at the beach followed by the best burger and fries Myesha smith has been with a company over seventeen years and has been everything from hostess to manager and has a strong passion for food people and service let's go I did not wait what is it about the wine burger that just keeps people coming back for more what's the unique flavors of the Hawaiian burger fresh grilled pineapple and the teriyaki sauce just makes you want to take a bite every single time make sure what's the first thing that we need to do to make the Hawaiian burger well the first thing we're going to do is get our fresh sliced pineapple we're going to take it right on over the grill and put two slices on now I understand you guys use a lot of pineapple islands 14,000 pounds per week that is crazy yes 7,000 pineapples for me so that's what our guys are cutting and this is really going to bring out that smoky flavor kind of caramelize it a little bit yes that's what makes our burger so unique using fresh ingredients so while that's cooking we're going to go ahead and get the burger patties Wow look how big that burger is Island has the biggest burger we do Pacific so we're going to season our burgers with our special Island seasoning just about three shakes is fine and you guys wait to season the burger - lets on the grill look at a purpose is that sir it actually brings out the seasoning a little bit better once it's actually on the burger versus before great I love that tip alright and how long are we gonna cook the burger for I usually cook it between 6 and 7 minutes so Malaysia what are the common mistakes that people make when they're making burgers well you have to be patient oftentimes the mistake is they press down on the burger which takes all the juices out so when you're patient you just watch the juices rise and then we're ready to flip all right oh you can flip that burger on over for us oh so yummy so after the flip we immediately get our Swiss cheese and put it right on that is another tip you put on the cheese right away and we're having Swiss cheese we are using switch to use today for that point and you already see that it's starting to caress the burger patty really nicely melted so we really want to wait till that melts down a little bit more we did already flip the pineapple so the pineapple is almost ready as well we're going to actually put the pineapple right on there so just like the burger patties and the pineapple we put our buns on the grill as well so we want to make sure they're nicely toasted as you see here you have a nice toasted bun and that really enhances the flavor so it's nice and crispy inside but flavorful and soft on the outside perfect you know this is the best part now we're gonna assemble the burger yes with the first component okay so we're taking our nice grilled bottom bun and we're going coast to coast with the mani so we are not shy with our portions I love that because I love mayonnaise perfect yes you coast to coast right across the bottom of the bunch so it's all nice to even now we're going to add a little bit of lettuce just handful and then a slice of onion I love it cuz we're gonna get the crunch of the onion and then the crunch of the pie now yes and all of our produce is cut fresh in every day so you get you really want to make sure you are using fresh bottom to get really enhancing flavors and then we're going to grab our burger patty okay we have the manis covered bun the crisp lettuce the onion the tomato and then that juicy piece of beef the melted Swiss and that smoky juicy pineapple that kind of gives it that little sweet factor right exactly and then the last thing we're going to do which is up my all-time favorite is putting a nice hearty scoop full of teriyaki right on top of the burger oh my goodness an entire scoop of that and then you'll start to kind of see that crepe down through the cheese and the burger patty and then we're gonna top it with our nice crisp oh my gosh Myesha I cannot wait to try this burger I know it's delicious and I have a perfect pineapple cocktail instead of partner them very well yeah let's go to the bar this is the Makaha margarita now we've taken that grilled pineapple that we grill on the grill it's used it with our tequila for three whole days just for this one drink and then we also have muddled pineapple in there and then you have a garnish with pineapple and the pineapple leaf so we literally use the entire pie now and then this cinnamon sugar rim is so good this is so refreshing and light and absolutely transports me to Hawaii yes all right Maya I am dying to dig right into the weinberger please do all right yourself ahh it is crazy huge how am I gonna do the whole thing Oh so you should be taking that teriyaki fresh oh my gosh it is so when I delicious and oh and then the pineapple it's so sweet with in a savory teriyaki yeah I could see why someone would want to order this every single time and you cannot come here and get burgers without getting their fries and these are endless endless fries so you asked for more fries ask for another drink and it's the perfect 19:30 oh this is so delicious Maya thank you so much for teaching me how to make this you were awesome cheers Cheers and thank you for watching and we'll see you next time on pop sugar
