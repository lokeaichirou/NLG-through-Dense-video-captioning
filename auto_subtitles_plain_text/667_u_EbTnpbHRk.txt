 hey everybody today I'm gonna show you how to make Olive Garden's meatballs with spaghetti and sauce it's so good okay anyway what third first thing you wanna do is get you some of my Italian sausage and clean them like this if you can't find some ground I used paste the links and just take that skin off do that to all of them the whole pound put them in your Bowl and then come down with a pound a hamburger meat this is 80/20 Chuck okay and I'm gonna add it to my bowl of sausage here crinkle it all up real nicely and I'm gonna get it all in here I'm gonna come in with a few goodies to make it taste good first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna put an egg in there okay and on top of the egg we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of Italian breadcrumbs make sure it's a tag and then I want to add one teaspoon of onion powder one teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt ok and now we want to get in here with our fingers and our gloves on when I do this I want to mix it up really really good ok and when you get it mixed really really good want you to kind of flatten it down where it can be covered with plastic you know it'll me but oh wait a minute we done forgot to put in one of the most important components of this thing all right and what is that pepper you can't make meatballs without having pepper in it you know to me anyway so I give up on having clean hands when I'm there with my fingers just did a real quick mix got to make sure all that peppers well distributed within the meat you know I'm saying and I got it pretty good so then I come out here with the plastic wrap like I was telling you earlier and put her on there and we've got to go in a refrigerator for at least four hours okay let's ease all these spices get up marinate into the meat and when you do it's time to make some baseballs I mean if you ever ate Olive Garden's meatballs spaghetti oh baby they're good anyway what you want to do is you want to get your mixture and you want to spray a little canola oil like I did on my pan my baking sheet here and I'm gonna make me some baseballs okay not quite baseball size but pert near you know what I'm saying and we need to make a de that's what my mixture made two pounds of meat made eight nice meatballs and then I want you to put them babies in a 350 5 degree oven for an hour after one hour take them out and I'm showing you here that I tested mine too that they were at 160 with an internal temperature that's right about where you need them when they come out of the oven after that one hour if you know what I mean and once you get them to that point and you are satisfied that your meat is done I want you to transfer them into a nice heavy skillet and pour in your favorite spaghetti sauce try not to pour it on the stove like I did okay and once you get her in there I want you to pick your spoon and move around and line them up properly in there where they'll cook evenly and maybe get a little sauce on you know me and my OCD I got a line up but perfectly miss like every time and then come in with a nice lid and simmer these babies until they're nice and warm or thinking you can take them like another maybe 45 minutes if you are too fast simmer to make sure they're nice and dumb and they are they're already done 160 inside and let it simmer like that with the lid oh oh they're done believe me okay oh baby will you look at those d delicious I guarantee you all right now here we go it's time to show you what we got now remember I'm a he that okay a good chef would remove that piece of spaghetti it fell over all my veggies at another I don't know a good chef probably would have made that spaghetti flat where these meatballs don't want to roll all over the place you know what I'm saying I'm trying to go all out for you guys I'm telling you you know I mean I'm trying to go all out for you here but shoot I said heck with all I'm gonna do is eat it it's gonna be all mixed up and run get it in there anyway so I'm on a coder here with little parmigiano-reggiano cheese Oh baby if you don't like Parmesan Reggiano don't add it and then I'm gonna come in here at my fork folks and when I made this yesterday I was so freakin hungry I'm not kidding you i starving and I forgot that I was just supposed to take a bite receipt to eat supper ah under the lights you know what I mean don't let nobody tell you that we don't use lights cuz we do you know what I mean hey folks if you like spaghetti and meatballs I know you're gonna love this give it a try please rate comment subscribe have a good date night
