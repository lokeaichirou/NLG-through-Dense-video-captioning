 welcome back to another sushi video tutorial I'm chef Devaux and today I'm going to show you guys how to make something spectacular something impossible something revolutionary something innovative it's possibly the future of sushi although it might not be who knows but what's certain is over the last hundred years sushi has evolved so much from something that took six months to make by fermenting rice and fish together to something which is made instantly in sushi bars across the country so this could be the future basically I use a Sumi machine to cook the fish to an exact temperature 40 degrees Celsius and then what happens is the fact dislocates the fish and you create these sesame sized fish flakes which are juicy and tender and perfectly cooked unlike anything you'll ever be able to achieve in a pan or pot and they're just magnificent it's a completely new way to love sushi so I hope you guys enjoy this little video let's get straight into making it let's go it's the first thing you want to do is you want to get a nice piece of salmon with the grain going right across and you don't want a curving of the grain so I've cut it specifically to be like so now you just want to make the brine which is simply 500 milliliters of water and then six percent salt and four percent sugar I just want to let this dissolve inside and then add your fish [Music] okay so it's been 24 hours since I brined the fish and I just Pat it dry and what's happened is the brine has seasoned the fish perfectly and it's changed structure so the albumin doesn't leach out the albumin is the white stuff that usually coats the outside of some when you cook it and this way you'll stay nice to oranjee when you cook it now I'm just going to stick inside this sube bag and then I'm just going to add 40 grams of extra virgin olive oil perfect all right so this pot very easy just put it inside your vacuum sealer make sure it's lined properly close it and perfect not easy alright and doesn't matter there's no air pocket with oil because you just want to basically poach it inside oil that's the Pancham okay so I've got this would be mushy 241 degrees Celsius I'm just gonna add the salmon in okay so you want to cook the salmon to about 40 degrees Celsius and I put the sous-vide machine at 41 degrees Celsius to make it go a bit faster and you want to leave it in there for about 25 minutes or 27 minutes 27 minutes if it's pretty thick piece of salmon 25 minutes not all right so after 27 minutes you pull yourself up and then you just let it rest for one or two minutes all right so once it's cooked what I'm going to do here is just take a butter knife and get right in between layers of fat and separated like so this piece a little bit small and just like so they come off pretty easy and it's almost like sashimi slices but not quite because it's not the way you cut a seam [Music] okay so you just put your knife in between the fat layer and it just comes apart and just help it slightly with your hand and this is so soft it's just incredible okay so you place your knife in between the fat layer and she's just slide in and it just comes off the fish-like so it's extremely soft because what's happened during the soft cooking is the fat has sort of melted and the tender tender fish is just so soft and juicy that it just falls apart oh it's now I've got everything prepared I've got some avocado slices and my salmon flakes in pieces wait look we like sashimi I'm just gonna add a little bit of soy wasabi err which you could check out how to make by clicking on the link on the top left corner to a plate now you just pull it out alright so now you just add some sliced avocado make sure to spread them out nicely perfect and now you add your salmon and just finish it off by adding a couple lower herbs or something to decorate in this case I'm using some mint and you can maybe just make your air come towards the mint so it can be fixed in place okay perfect okay I hope you guys enjoyed watching how to make this delicately cooked salmon sashimi and if you want to make it without the stream machine it's possible but it would take a lot of effort you'd have to sit there and turn the gas on and off and watch it with a thermometer for 27 minutes which would be hell so I would suggest just making the investment it's the same as any other cooking machine in your kitchen it's it cost money so if you want to buy it you can just right now by clicking on the Left anyway I guess that's everything and I guess there's nothing let's do but try it yeah delicate fish dip inside the soya sauce and they it here it's got such juicy delicate flavors of fish and the textures just it's somewhere in between cooked Android's remarkable i really suggest you guys try this at home it's amazing god alright that's all and now I'll just show you a little clip about my new kitchen which being built this will be my new kitchen now it's still under construction as you can see I'm really excited about it it's been taking so long to build this I have to lay down a concrete floor with tiles 2.4 I think that that was painful and I figured out how to do it all the way just watching some YouTube videos and getting on with it which is what you do know about it okay so once this kitchen is finished in about what two months it will be dedicated
