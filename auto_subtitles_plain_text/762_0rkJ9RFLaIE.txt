 [Music] hi i'm stephanie manley with copykat.com today we're gonna revisit the Olive Garden we just love recipes from the olive garden today we're gonna make the pasta fazool soup so many of you love this recipe and we are going to prepare this recipe for you right now so we've got lots of ingredients in this Olive Garden pasta fazool we have ground meat that's not pictured here but we're gonna go ahead and brown it up and then we've got white beans we have Tippie beans we have two jars of marinara sauce just use your favorite kind a couple of cans of diced tomatoes we have some low-sodium beef broth it's a really good idea to use the low-sodium because we don't want to get in too much salt then we have chopped onions chopped celery [Music] give carats a little bit of Tabasco or just a little bit of heat some ground black pepper oregano [Music] parsley finally some dry pasta so use whatever you have on hand I'm using penne pasta right here but it really doesn't matter what you use so let's go ahead and get started cooking that recipe okay we're going to begin by sweating the vegetables so that means we're gonna just cook up the celery and the onions and everything until the onions are translucent now I'm sweating them in a couple of tablespoons of butter you can use vegetable oil both work equally as well this is at a medium to a medium-high heat so my onions are almost translucent and I'm gonna go ahead and add in my ground meat I'm using a really lean ground meat so I'm not gonna drain this but if you're using something that's fifteen or twenty percent fat in your hamburger meat you may want to go ahead and drain this but again this is extremely lean so we're just gonna break this up and let it brown for a few minutes and then we'll add in everything else don't be concerned that the meat isn't fully cooked at this point the soups gonna cook for an additional 45 minutes so by the time the soups done the meat will be cooked thoroughly okay we're gonna begin by adding everything else into our pot and again that's two jars of marinara sauce the mirin era sauce helps flavor the soup itself so you don't have to worry about a lot of seasoning so go ahead pick out your favorite kind of marinara sauce I always buy extra but it goes on sale so I have plenty on hand we're going to go ahead and add our canned diced tomatoes [Music] we're gonna add in our white beans we're going to add in our red kidney beans [Music] see it's looking really good already we're gonna add in our black pepper we're gonna add in our egg I know we're gonna add in our parsley a little bit of Tabasco for a little bit of heat and then we're gonna add in our beef broth again I really recommend you using a low sodium cause you don't want your soup over salted even before you get the chance to season it yourself I raise now we're gonna add in our pasta if you plan on freezing the soup you may want to cook your pasta before and add it just before serving but sometimes freezing pasta makes it soft and mushy so just a tip if you want to freeze the soup don't add your pasta in until just before serving we're gonna eat all of our soup right away so we're gonna go ahead and add in our pasta and we're gonna let the liquid that's in the soup cook the pasta so the students been cooking for about 35 to 45 minutes and you can see it's just chocked full of beans and meat with tomatoes and carrots it's gonna be so good we've just finished making the Olive Garden's pasta fazool soup so please come to my website copykat.com because there are lots more recipes at ich just like they do in the Olive Garden's hi I'm Stephanie Manley have you ever wondered how your favorite restaurant makes that special dish well I put together over 1500 recipes that taste just like they do in the restaurant visit copykat.com and find recipes from the olive guard steakhouse the cracker barrel and so much more visit copykat.com and discover recipes such as the olive garden alfredo sauce olive garden salad dressing and hooter's fried pickles you've tried it in the restaurant now make it at home [Music]
