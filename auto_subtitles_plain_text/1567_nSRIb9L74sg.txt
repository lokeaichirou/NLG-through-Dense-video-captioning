Pat's cruises calm you - Mike Higgins I'm chef of the old salt restaurant in Hampton New Hampshire today we're going to be making a nice professional clam chowder first of all you need to start with some great ingredients before you make your clam chowder's or anything else for that matter we have saw we onions potatoes creamed clams clam broth these are the clams that you would buy and you would get at the your local retail store like 3 ounce cans you need 12 ounces for my recipe along with some clam broth fresh parsley possibly grow outside their own herb garden here these are types of clams here that that we purchased for the restaurant ourselves we get larger cans because we make it much larger quantities when we get those clams we get them whole so we dice them up ourselves so we get a less consistent clam in the in the chowder itself which is great these are what the clams begin with so this is a cherrystone clam you know they open them up here and you know open up the clams and this is the clam that you see and then they end up whole clams we get a little larger clam sometimes and then they dice up here we get a little less consistent clairement in the in the chowder which is really nice you get some big pieces in little pieces that go all throughout one of the real secrets to clam chowder is the cream that you use and this is a local clean cream from a local farm this is actually maiden or farmed from Haven New Hampshire hatchling farms and it's a pasteurized cream but it's not ultra pasteurized so you have a much higher butter fat content and sweeter cream in it it really enhances the chowder first we start cooking our bacon and we take the bacon and we want to cook it on a medium heat because we don't want to get any little black chunks or burnt pieces in there and listen to that you can almost smell it can't you that's great and so we'll cook the bacon down and then we're going to save those drippings and we're going to cook our potatoes and onions and celery and stuff right in that bacon so we'll take this bacon when we move it from the pan we can save this bacon for BLT sandwiches the next day or we can I come lit up put it right in the chowder that's what we normally like to do always you know I get a quarter inch slice of my potatoes and stuff like that I usually put my potatoes in first once again you want to keep this on a nice low heat a nice low flame because you don't want to get any burnt pieces in there while that's cooking and simmering what I'll do is and I dice up my onions and celery I've already done that for time here that I can add my onions and celery that's beautiful then we are will just saute that up for a while keep that on a nice low heat as I said and we're going to cook that in a low heat for about 20 minutes we'll let that cook okay now we sauteed our onions celery and potatoes for about 20 minutes they're all nice and tender and cooked up nice potatoes are still a little firm but there's still going to be some cooking once we add the clam broth so we're going to just add a little butter in there and let that melt down beautiful we let that melt in and by your adding the butter when you add your clam broth it's not like adding your a liquid right into your bacon drippings which would splatter all up so that helps so quite a bit so then we can add the clam broth and now we're going to bring that up to a boil now we can turn up our heat a little and this is going to you know help finish cooking the potatoes and it will help cook those onions down so you won't even you know you won't even see and notice those onions in there but you'll just get that great flavor get out a little fresh parsley pinch of black pepper that's just a taste beautiful stuff I always have my clams last because they're already precooked and stuff and I don't want to get them all all rubbery and stuff like that so once I once I get this boiling and I start to thicken this and when we make this we make just a base we don't add any of our dairy until we're actually reheating it for a second time we get ready to serve it that gives us a much better shelf life we don't have to worry about the cream breaking down or anything like that you do have to let it sit for a few minutes just so you can get you know all those flavors extracted into the cream so we have that at a nice nice simmer we've been simmer for about 15 15 minutes it's actually reduced our clam broth down a little as well and really enhance the the clam flavor in it so then I can add a little a little flour and a couple of spoons of flour you want it you want to turn this back down now you want to simmer it again make sure you get all the lumps out of the clay out out of the flour but that will stir in nicely and then once I once I get that going and I get that thickens I will take my clams and I will add my clams at this point and the clams still have a lot of juice in them too so you're actually going to see it's going to thin it back out a touch but then you need to just let it simmer for a while and that will thicken up to a nice nice paste and you want it nice and thick almost like a pancake batter or something like that you're going to mix it when you get this base you want to mix it about 50/50 with the cream so now what I've done is I've transferred my base and I've got it nice and thick and this is the consistency you want it I've transferred into a bigger pot because I'm going to add the cream to it now and I'm actually going to double the volume that I've made you can take this base and you can you know you can cut it in half but happen to refrigerator and it'll hold for a couple weeks easy because once again you have no dairy products in there let's get nice and thick and it'll continue to thick so we do want to simmer it you know what once we get this cream in there and this is once again is a nice fresh cream it's a New Hampshire cream beautiful beautiful product but I'm going to do is I'm going to just sit here I'm going to let that simmer now I'm going to really reduce the heat get it on as low as I can and I'm going to just heat that up nice and slow in order to not break the cream I want to bring it up to about 160 degrees and it's going to thicken up and you know as it sits it's going to get a little thicker and thicker and that's that's a great great product
