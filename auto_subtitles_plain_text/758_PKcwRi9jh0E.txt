 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale a miscible sort of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mashed potatoes they're going to be perfectly cooked with the most luscious combination of heavy milk heavy cream milk butter put together to make the perfect mashed potato super simple and easy to do so let's go ahead and get started now before we get started of course we got to go over the ingredients so let's do it you're going to need some Yukon Gold potatoes some whole milk heavy cream unsalted butter salt and pepper that's it simple and easy but perfect every single time so first thing you want to do is get a big pot and fill it with water and put a nice gentle sprinkling of salt in there now second thing would don't turn it on because to make the perfect mashed potatoes you got to start with cold water because when they when the when the cold water goes to boiling point that way the potato gets cook really fully all the way through evenly if you put the potatoes in boiling water the very outside of the potato starts to get cooked right away while the inside hasn't had a chance to cook yet so that makes it uneven and not very good now I'm using a potato ricer to get these nice and fluffy which means I don't need to peel them because a potato ricer catches the skin so that's another reason why I love the potato ricer but if you want to use this a regular masher then I will suggest you peel them first and all I'm doing is just quartering the really big ones and having the little ones and then I'm just going to put these into the boiling water or actually into the water bring it up to a boil and let it cook for about a half-hour or so or until the potatoes are tender now if you haven't seen this yet this is a potato ricer this will make your life a whole lot easier when you're making mashed potatoes if you have one of these because as I'll demonstrate you can put your potatoes peeled on everything in here I'll just put a couple pieces in there so you can see then you can just pass it through there's no peel in there right it's all up here see that that's going to make your life a whole lot easier if I can get a hold of it and get it off so I'm just going to continue passing them all through I my potatoes all pureed in this bowl now in this little pan all I did was I put the heavy cream the whole milk and the butter and I just let it warm up you don't want to let it come to a boil don't want to do that you just want everything to kind of warm up and the butter to melt and that's it now the consistency of this is completely up to you some people like them really thick and chunky some people like them super creamy and loose I like it somewhere in between I guess but you know it's like I said it's totally optional so I'm just gonna work this in little by little you don't want to start with too much because then it's going to be difficult to take it out if you've overdone it I'm going to just season it you want to season it well my mother is what my mother would have a heart attack right now because I'm using black pepper she uses white pepper but she's not here so I do what I want season it well with salt because potatoes are just very very bland and they don't taste like anything unless you salt them touch more cream and then this consistency is perfect for me so I'm going to stop but again you can control however you like it now I'm just going to put in a bowl and we're pretty much done now with Thanksgiving run around the corner you know everyone's going to have mashed potatoes and I know quite a few people we're going to make them right out of the box and I think that that is tragedy because you can make it from scratch you can make it super easy it's not expensive and it's so like how long did it take I mean you really didn't do much besides put them in a pan let it come up to a boil they cooked you finish them off done that's it hope you've enjoyed spending time with me to get this recipe and others good Debbie Debbie Debbie kitchen comm that's the next time bye bye you
