 thanks to Allrecipes member Marshall Malloy know who shares this recipe for sauerkraut for canning Allrecipes member hot she says after making this easy to do recipe she'll never use store-bought sauerkraut again the original recipe uses 50 pounds of cabbage but we've cut it down to just 5 pounds begin by cutting the cabbage into quarters for a twist on your sauerkraut try using purple cabbage instead then remove the cores and thinly cut the cabbage about the thickness of a dime if you prefer you can cut the cabbage using a mandolin or food processor in a large bowl layer the cabbage with three tablespoons of canning salt mix it together and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes to wilt add the cabbage to a clean food safe container or pickling jar press firmly until the juices come to the surface there isn't enough liquid to cover the cabbage many all recipes members suggest making a quick brine with 2 cups of cold water and 3/4 tbsp of salt next cover the cabbage with cheesecloth or muslin and tuck the edges down against the inside of the container be sure to weigh the cabbage down so that it is completely covered by brine set the container at a room temperature of about 70 degrees to begin the fermentation process this will usually take anywhere between three to six weeks if you notice any scum forming be sure to remove and discard it after several weeks of fermenting the sauerkraut is ready if you wish you can follow the recipe directions to can the sauerkraut or keep it refrigerated for up to a month you
