 nobody can resist onion rings and these old-fashioned onion rings are simply scrumptious one Allrecipes member named genie who submitted this recipe says this is an actual recipe from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant crispy coated onion rings like the pros make you'll need a deep fryer for this recipe let's start by heating one quart of oil in the fryer to three hundred and sixty-five degrees you'll need a deep fry thermometer while the oil is heating slice one large onion into slices now separate the onion slices into rings then in a flat bowl add together one and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of baking powder a teaspoon of salt and blend these next dip each onion ring into the flour mixture and coat them fully now add in a cup of milk to the flour and mix it with a fork then beat in an egg to make a batter then dip the floured onion rings into the batter set up a wire draining rack using aluminum foil or a baking pan as a base to catch any drips and set them on the wire rack to drip when all the rings are battered or dried breadcrumbs into a shallow pan or dish now lay the battered onion rings onto the crumbs and scoop the crumbs over the rings to coat get each ring a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs to shake off any loose crumbs the coating should really cling to the onion rings once you've breaded all the rings deep fry them until each ring is golden brown let the rings drink briefly on paper towel serve them while they're warm mMmmm old fashioned onion rings just like the ones you get at the drive-in only better because you made them at home
