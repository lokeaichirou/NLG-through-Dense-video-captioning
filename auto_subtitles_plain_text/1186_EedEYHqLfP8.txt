 you know my son really loves my big macaroni and cheese and so does his friends I always say how do you get it so creamy and cheesy so I'm going to make some put a graduation party I'm going to show you how I make my creamy baked macaroni and cheese here's everything you'll need you can also find this recipe on our website at your house a home TV calm - macaroni first you're going to need cheese like a Velveeta and this is a 32 ounce and I'm going to use about a third of this and when you use four cups of shredded I like to use a Colby Monterey Jack mix this is a Mexican Blin so that's about half at this 24 ounce bag you're going to need a can of evaporated milk and a can of water and 16 ounces of elbow macaroni and that's it so let me show you how to put this together this will make a pan about this size that feeds about eight to ten people start by bringing a large pot of water to boil then add a little salt to the water then you're going to pour in your box of macaroni cook for about 10 minutes on a medium to high heat stir occasionally when it's done drain into a colander put a macaroni into a baking pan or a baking dish and while that's still warm at one or two tablespoons of butter and a little bit of salt and mix it through the macaroni let that sit and cool while you make your cheese sauce before you start making your cheese sauce pre-heat your oven to 350 for the sauce in the same pot pour a can of evaporated milk then refill the can with water and pour that in and add 10 ounces of Velveeta type cheese turn the heat on medium break up the cheese and stir occasionally as it starts to melt after the cheese is melted and blended pour in 2 cups of Colby Jack shredded cheese stir for a few minutes and turn off the heat now that the macaroni is cool blendin one egg throughout the whole pan then pour new cheese sauce and mix in well if you need to you can add a little more water to make a creamier sauce you really want to be able to see the sauce right below the top layer of the back aleni after that's blended cover the top of the macaroni with the last two cups of shredded cheese then cover the pan with oil then bake at 350 for about 15 to 20 minutes after 15 minutes check the pan if the sauce is bubbling it should be ready you want to take it out while the sauce is thick and creamy and the cheese is just melted on top nice and cheesy and creamy so at the graduation party the macaroni was a hit I made four pans at ease and they all went really fast along with collard greens barbecue chicken barbecue ribs baked beans hamburgers hot dogs corn on the cob shrimp and we even had a little Lobster so everyone had a great time inside and outside
