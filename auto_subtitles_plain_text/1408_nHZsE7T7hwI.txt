 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the potato pancakes one of my favorite potato preparations is something i just don't make often enough super easy to make take two pounds actually i had two and a quarter two pounds of russet potatoes peel them and then grate them with a cheese grater into a bowl of very cold water and I'm also gonna grate in half an onion into the same bowl and by the way you've never cried until you've created onion it's good it's good cry all right once that's done I'm gonna add some more water fill it up a little more and these are just gonna sit in the cold water for about 20-30 minutes you don't need to rinse it just let me sit there in the meantime take a couple eggs some flour black pepper little pinch of cayenne salt of course and we're gonna whisk that up until very smooth and then set that aside when our potatoes are ready drain them rinse them put them in a colander and squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze all the water must be squeezed out so I squeeze it a fistful at a time and then I press it again with some paper towel make sure all the waters out of your potatoes it's the only way to screw this up is to have wet potatoes once the potatoes are as dry as humanly possible add them to a bowl mix in your egg mixture with a spatula and that is a potato pancake mixture ready to fry it's an incredibly easy recipe I told you I'm gonna cover that while I make these because you don't want any air to get to the potatoes if possible because they do oxidize this is not something you could store put away and you know it's gonna be good the next day you're gonna want to make this stuff fresh all right now to fry these we're gonna use a heavy-duty skillet with a good amount of oil you they say a quarter-inch of oil I don't know if you can quite need that much on the bottom but you need enough oil to come up the side at least halfway up the pancake if you want a nice crispy cake this one I'm just doing a little test to taste for salt we're gonna heat the pan on medium-high and when it's hot add your pancake mixture flatten it out this one's a little smaller than the ones you're gonna see but again I'm just tasting for seasoning I'm gonna taste this oh man so good and it did need a little more seasoning so what you want to do is you want to put your oil in the pan he had to medium-high when it starts to shimmer add your potatoes flatten him down a little bit they don't have to be round who says they have to be round if I've said it once I've said it a thousand times the kitchen is no place for a perfectionist all right flat him down to about a half inch cook them for about like I said five minutes per side you've got to see the edges get really crispy and crunchy before you turn them five minutes on the other side and when I flip them normally I'll turn it down to medium because this is raw potato you got to give it time to cook through if you keep going on high heat or medium high the whole way sometimes towards the end the edges start getting a little too Brown in the middle isn't quite tender enough and there you go I top mine with smoked salmon sour cream and dill very classic combination you can do these with apple sauce a sour cream another even more classic combination or just plain next to some eggs and bacon anyway go to the site the ingredients for the filling are quite important so go check those out and as always enjoy you
