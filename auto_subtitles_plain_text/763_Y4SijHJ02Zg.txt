 I'm Johnny and this is my North Beach making pasta fagioli aka pasta fazool this is a favorite of mine and it's also a favorite of lovely on more thirteen who suggested that I make this on youtube so that's what I'm cooking today so let me show you the ingredients for pasta fazool here's a cannellini beans that I soaked overnight de tolly nee the little short cut pasta extra virgin olive oil celery onion garlic fresh Italian parsley bay leaf dried oregano sea salt black pepper tomato puree and some pecorino so let me get the Odori going first I'm gonna use celery and onion so there's one the second one see these leaves over here this is gonna get flavor to it if I got celery leaves we're gonna use them okay there's my celery then we're gonna take a half an onion okay down we got a little bit of garlic here babul and babul is this a rough chop also let me get my pan going I'm using this enamel pot we're gonna give it some olive oil maybe about two tablespoons I'd say get these in does the celery the onions the garlic bay leaf well that goodness is going right in there I don't want to get any color on this so I'm gonna keep a good eye on it and we just want them to soften a little bit they'll finish cooking in the in the soup of course but I just want to cook them a little bit to bring out their flavor any time I'm making a soup or a stew I'll always start this way by cooking your herbs or your garlic onions we'll just let those go for a minute isn't now that the onions and the celery have sweated down a little bit this is my Sicilian art oregano and they're gonna add that now just let that toast up I've got the cannellini beans that I soaked overnight and I'm gonna put a cup or two of these in you don't want to soak beans overnight because you can use can cannellini beans just make sure that you drain them well because you know there's gonna be a lot of that starts down at the bottom of the candy you don't want that in here we're gonna add some water to this you could use chicken stock you can use vegetable stock but this is going to be such a flavorful dish I don't think you need it I don't want the salt I don't want the other flavor so I'm just using some good old Hetch Hetchy water here in San Francisco you want to make sure that you're more than fully covering the beans so we're gonna bring the the heat up to high the lid on the jar and we'll just test these in about 15 minutes and see if the beans are tender so the beans have been cooking for about ten minutes in the boiling water so I just want to add the final ingredients here before the pasta goes in so I'm just going to add some parsley here to help flavor that broth right because it's just water a little bit of salt and pepper and then we can always adjust this is a tomato puree from Italy so I'm going to add some of this for color take a look you see how we're doing I think my beans are gonna be let me taste one for you don't get burnt here mmm beans are around just about for the cleaning stage time to get my DEET aleni you know usually my mother used to make this with de tolly right there but it's it ended over here no way and I because they're a bigger cut than this it's hard to find Attali this cut sometimes so DITA Lina you see more often so I'm using that it's gonna be just as good [Applause] some people like to cook their pastas separate and then add it so there's one downside to doing it this way the pasta is gonna swell up so you better eat this soon the good thing is that some of that starch from the D talena are gonna help thicken this soup so we'll let it go probably about another five six minutes and we're gonna we're gonna be eating some pasta fazool let me taste it I've got a bean and I got something I think it's gonna be done perfect these a little salt right oh is it just salt and pepper now give it a little bit of fresh pepper too here okay so this isn't a real watery soup see you can see ER Co thicken because it had the starch coming off the pasta it's the way you want okay so here's our pasta fazool I'm just gonna brighten it up a little bit with some parsley I saw the boiled a little drizzle a little pecorino look at the mess I made over get that all in there that cheese is expensive I don't want to lose any okay let me take a little bit here see how nice and thick it is though you don't want this to be like a broth look at that some of the beans some it a little de tolly nee burn in my hand mmm just like my mother made it in Jersey be sure you subscribe and you can check out another episode here [Music] hey what are you waiting for click son [Music] [Applause] when the moon eat your face wake up big pizza pie dance some more day when the stars make you drool that's pasta fazool and I'm having some more rave [Music]
