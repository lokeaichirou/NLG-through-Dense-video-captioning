 all right so let's make our marinade for our chicken wings remember these are crispy wings anyway we've got some black pepper some salt some granulated garlic I'd rather use that than the powder but you can get powder be fine some cayenne pepper for a little bit of spice now I'm going to put some hot sauce this is the vinegar base stuff use whatever brand you like now we're going to add our buttermilk and then we're just going to give us a really good stir to mix everything up and then we're going to pour our marinade over our chicken we're going to mix it up really good and then we're going to put it in a refrigerator for about one hour you can go two hours but I would not go over three you marinate these things too long and the butter melts going to break them down and they'll just fall apart I have some all-purpose flour here and we're going to season that with the same seasonings that we seasoned our marinade with except I'm not gonna put any hot sauce in here then we'll give us a good mix and we're going to coat our chicken with this seasoned flour now don't wash that buttermilk off just let it kind of drip off a little bit and then we're going to get a nice thick coat of this flour mixture on here what we're going to do we're going to put it on this sheet pans we're going to let them set for about 10 minutes and after about 10 minutes they're going to look like this see how you got some dry spots and some wet spots like right there you get a wet spot anyway we're gonna take care of that right now and all we're going to do is we're going to put these things back in the flour this is the same flour that we were using before but now whenever I get done doing this part I'm going to throw that flour way I don't want to save it because it's had raw chicken in all right I'm gonna test my oil I put a little piece of flour in there looks good I want a nice gentle fry on this first fry that's a lot of fries yeah anyway um if I had a thermometer I'd be looking for about 340 F now as soon as I get some color on both sides of this chicken color just about like that I'm gonna take it out and put it on the wire rack and then I'll start on the next batch alright my last batch is done and what I'm going to do when I get these out is I'm going to crank the heat up to 375 F and now that the oil is up to a second fried temp we're going to put our first batch of wings back into the oil now that we have this batch of wings in the oil we're going to keep stirring them around I don't want them to set on the bottom because if they do they'll get black spots on and I want them to have a nice pretty golden brown color all the way around and then when our wings get nice and crispy and golden brown just about like that we're going to pull them out and put them back on the wire rack now don't those look good nice and crispy nice and hot a little bit spicy as always how does it taste I know one thing is hot like the only thing crunching it's got a little bit of heat it's not hot not gross spicy then again the depends on your spice level this thing is loaded with flavor its moist absolutely wonderful please give this a try
