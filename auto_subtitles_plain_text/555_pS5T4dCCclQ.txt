 anybody that buys hummus needs to watch this because it will taste fantastic and it's going to taste much better than what you buy at the supermarket right little blender perfect for the job can of drained chickpeas next up the lemon juice lemon zest I'm just going to put in a little bit of the lemon zester right George get a little festive worried about the zest of half a lemon I don't think we need the the whole one especially with a microplane because you get an enormous amount of zest often then we just roll that lemon just to sort of break the segment's inside just to release the juice I'm just going to squeeze the juice of that lemon in obviously just using that little sieve because I don't want the hips in next up half a clove of garlic and then this is tahini this is organic tahini which is beautiful and tahini is a ground sesame seed so it's ground into a paste bit like peanut butter that's essentially what it is so I normally put in a good spoonful of teeny because I love the stuff and then a little pinch of mild paprika a little pinch of salt from George and then just a bit of good extra virgin olive oil just to get it started so just get it going and then obviously what you're doing is make it into a nice paste so you can add a little bit more oil it's probably going to be about half a cup of oil to 3/4 of a cup by the time you finish we want this to be a little bit lighter for this dish so just a splash of water and that will lighten it up and make it nice and smooth hmm yeah right isn't it how easy is that so there's the hummus here to fall easy to make and if you buy one of these little babies just put a lid on and chuck it in the fridge done
