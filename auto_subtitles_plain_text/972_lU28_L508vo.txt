 Lubin bub is a staple dish in Korea and it's so healthy for you this version is called dolsot bibimbap and the difference between this and the normal one is that it's cooked in a Korean style play pot you can use this recipe to make regular bibimbap as well just use a normal bowl and fry the egg before you put it in I also use multigrain rice instead of regular rice as it's much healthier for you if you watch the middle of this video I also have a bonus beauty treatment for you using one of the ingredients let's start you'll need a small bowl of cooked rice I've used Korean style multigrain rice some veggies I chose English spinach and enoki mushroom and carrot some marinated bulgogi beef you can see my blog for more details on how to marinate this or you can buy it pre-marinated an egg and some Korean style chili paste also you'll need a Korean style clay pot to cook this in step 1 prepare your vegetables use a vegetable peeler and peel your carrot throw away the first layer you can use a knife to cut the carrot into thin strips but it's easier and safer to just use the vegetable peeler to create your carrot strips peel a small handful and put it aside why should prepare your other vegetables like your spinach in your key mushrooms now you're ready to cook them step 2 cook your sides put a little bit of oil in a pan and cook your beef stir until the color has changed to a brown take it off the pan now you have some leftover beef flavor in your pan add your carrot strips straight in to absorb the beef stock this will add flavor to your carrots and minimize waste put your carrots aside when it starts to wilt now add your na q mushrooms and a little bit of water these mushrooms cook better with a bit of water and steam once they start getting soft you can add some salt to season put aside lately oil your pan again and cook your spinach add some salt to season once I start getting softer cooked you can put it aside in a box with your other vegetables step 3 make your clay pot rice you want to put your clay pot onto the stove and lightly oil it use a paper towel and spread the oil evenly on the bottom of the clay pot so your rice doesn't stick now it's time to arrange your clay pot rice place your rice fast and spread it lightly so it's even now arrange your cooked beef carrots spinach and enoki mushrooms around the plot it looks so pretty crack your egg and use a spoon to carefully separate the yolk from the egg way the egg white will make your bidden bubs soggy so we'll only use the yolk for this place your egg yolk in the middle now turn on the stove and heat up your clay pot now for the exciting bonus part don't throw away your egg white yet you can actually use the egg white as a tightening and softening mask while you wait for your boomer back to cook all you need to do is apply it on your face and let it dry this will take around 15 to 30 minutes it will start to feel tight when it starts drying I use the foundation brush to put it on my face so it's not so messy and for those of you with sensitive or broken skin or acne prone skin this may not be the best treatment for you now back to our booming bub after about three minutes it will be done you can leave it for longer for around five minutes if you want the bottom of the rice to be more crispy the aim is to cook it enough for the stone pot to be hot enough to cook your egg when you mix it and now we're done delicious and healthy doll slop moving but the chilli paste is to mix in when you're ready to eat and you can add as much as you like I love the chilli paste so I actually add a lot of this when I start to eat it the clay pot keeps the rice warm and it's perfect for a cold day I hope you enjoyed this recipe for this hearty healthy Korean style dish which comes with a bonus natural face treatment all in one healthy body and glowing skin it's such a perfect combination but is your favorite Korean dish I also have a soft spot for spicy tofu stew and ginseng chicken soup remember to thumb this video up if you'd like more cooking videos for me make life beautiful the wonderful world of wengie don't forget to check out my other cooking videos I've shown you how to make three delicious and low calorie snacks from egg and you should also check out the sweets I made for Halloween they're super cute I'll see you guys in my next video bye
