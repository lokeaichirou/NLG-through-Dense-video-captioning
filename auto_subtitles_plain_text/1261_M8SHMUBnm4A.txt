 okay gentlemen we're making scrambled eggs today it's very simple as you can see what I got here two eggs and a tablespoon of butter that is it very nice very simple very fluffy very yummy now while our pan is preheating we're going to crack to it all right so we put our two eggs into the bowl here so what we're going to do now is while we're just waiting for our little pen to preheat we're going to go ahead and wait for that to get to the point where when we put the butter on it bubbles a little bit then we're going to scramble the eggs we're not going to scramble them and let them sit we're going to actually wait for the pan to be warm enough and then we'll go ahead and and scramble the eggs there it only takes about a minute or two anyway so you're not you know that pan is pretty much ready to go in about 3700 pan is preheated and how do we know if it's ready simple we put our butter in you'll start to see the bubbles forming on the butter there see how it's starting to form go ahead and let that butter get melted through see that butters or bubbles are coming up through and then while we're doing that we're just going to go ahead and whip these eggs the key to whipping the eggs and the reason as to why we're doing it is because we're trying to get bubbles see those bubbles those bubbles are we're going to make it fluffy the more bubbles the fluffier da you don't need anything else to add to make it a fluffy egg and that butter is almost ready there so yeah fluff the butter around the pan see that beautiful butter key to it is a lot of butter as well that gives it a nice wonderful flavor so now we're going to put our eggs in and we put our eggs in it's going to whip them a little bit more before I put them in like this and then look at that look at those bubbles absolutely beautiful now the key here is as we cook them we're just going to kind of move along a little bit like that one to the side one to another side little by little and as we move them little by little you see the egg starts to form the scrambled egg starts to form there all right so here we are 20 seconds later here see how everything is coming together the butter is getting nice and soaked up into the egg which is going to be absolutely beautiful and lovely you can even go like this if you'd like let's some in the middle it doesn't matter you don't even need to flip it the key to it is just going like this back and forth that's it really look it look how beautiful look at the color of that egg it's gorgeous okay so we're back and look at the egg now it's almost finished you see that I'm going to give it about another probably eight seconds because it's going to cook once I take it off four three two one look at that the computer phone yellow that is done and here is the final product here what you got here is your lovely scrambled egg and if you like put a little salt on top and little crush pepper voila there you go simple is it composite going to be you're going to taste absolutely delicious you
