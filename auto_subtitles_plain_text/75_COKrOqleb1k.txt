 my name is Rene and welcome to proudly Indian cooking first you add four cups of baking flour to a mixing bowl then you add one and a half teaspoon of salt then you add 1/2 cup of oil and one tablespoon of butter add a little bit of boiling water at a time as you are mixing until it forms a soft dough note water must be boiling water once your door is nice and soft remove it from your mixing bowl and add it onto a table add a little flour unto your working surface to prevent the dough from sticking to your table now roll your dough out into a sheet add some flour once your dough is rolled out into sheets add a little butter and a little flour to your dough and roll it all in together now once your dough is rolled out pinch out small pieces and roll them into small balls now using a rolling pin flatten your small pieces of dough into rotis place your chin to a flat frying pan ensuring each side cooks for plus/minus 30 seconds now we have added butter to one side of the roti but this is optional so let's demonstrate just one more Rorty this mixture makes two dozen rotis we're rolling out your ot ensure that you roll it as thin as possible because if the Rajee is too thick then it gets too hard overnight with the roti that we've made you can keep it in the fridge or freezer and once reheated it's still a soft so if you try this recipe Alex be sure to send us your feedback on our website at proudly Indians Co today we would love to hear from you
