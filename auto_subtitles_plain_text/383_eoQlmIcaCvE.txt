 hi and welcome to cooking with karma now this week I'm sharing with you two really great bread recipes now started off the week with that delicious wholemeal bread of course if you haven't seen that video you can click right up here and watch it now today I'm going to show you how to make some naan bread this is so delicious and yummy and it is a lot simpler than you think so let's get started and I'll show you how to make it first up into a glass filled with a small amount of warm water we're going to add in the sugar and the yeast while up to one side into a bowl we're going to sift in our flour and add in the salt and the baking powder the natural yogurt and the milk once our yeast mixture has become nice and frothy we're going to add that in as well and then give everything a good mix now you can start off with a spoon but eventually you'll need to get in there with your hands you want to mix everything together until it forms a dough then onto a floured surface we're going to knead that dough now we're going to knead this for about 5 to 6 minutes until that dough becomes nice and smooth then within a pop our dough into a greased Bowl cover it up with a tea towel and pop it in a warm dry spot for about an hour now to prepare the spinach into a pan I'm going to add a little bit of olive oil and a teaspoon of garlic cook for a minute or so and then turn down the heat to low then I'm going to add in the spinach drizzle with a small amount of water give it a quick mix and we're going to pop the lid on and let that spinach wilt down then we're going to drain off any excess liquid and put it to one side to cool once our dough has risen to about twice its size we're going to give it another quick need for a couple of minutes and then we're going to chop it up into three different pieces or two if you want to make them bigger and then we're going to roll them out into an oval shape until they're about half a centimeter thick then it's just a matter of assembling everything together add on the spinach and the cheese then place the second piece on top and press down the edges for the garlic naan simply to spread on a little bit of olive oil and add on the crushed garlic sprinkle with some cracked pepper and then we're ready to cook them into a pan on medium heat we're going to add in some butter and then we're going to cook these on either side for about four to five minutes until they're nice and golden brown do the same with the garlic naan then we're going to pop them into the oven for about seven minutes to finish that cooking process and then they are done so whether you stop them with your favorite filling please keep them nice and simple these really are delicious hmm YUM now whether you serve that up with your favorite curry or your favorite condiment I do hope you give it a go because it's absolutely delicious thanks again for joining me and I'll see you next time I'm cooking with karma
