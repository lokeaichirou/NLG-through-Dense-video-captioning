 we are Ben's Jamie Barry and Mike the guys are the hearts of sorted food in this series of videos we look at some of the most popular recipes that feature Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce shepherd's pie in my opinion is the family dish but how do we make it out of the ordinary well especially in parents and a few other flavors this is going to be special this recipe we've got a selection of root vegetables will cook those off in passata with some Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce add our lamb mince obviously the main base meat of this dish and top of the creamy mashed potatoes other cream perfect so start with our root veg they did a bit of shopping we look carrot onion celery and garlic should I do this into the left hand on the right hand both peeled and diced if you do the same with those two is this kind of dish you'd have a home you're growing up with your family definitely it seems to be one of those things that you cook that's really nice feeds a lot of people that's it it's never something that I would order in a restaurant because I don't think I've ever seen you on a restaurant man I don't think it's considered restaurant fare it is more comforting for home but there's no reason why it shouldn't because the flavors and combinations are Britain so onion and carrot going into Errol and I've a gentle heat we're going to start to cook those and sweat them up we don't too much color autumn so gently is the key I'm not going to eat your garlic you take that I mean I'm aware that I've been peeling this for quite a long time so I might chop it yeah just fingers first so time is fine didn't garlic going in there also at this stage is worth adding in a pinch of salt well it does just draw some moisture out of the onions they do that celery come in demo and with a vegetable stop when the pedicure a few minutes or so allowed to go in as well how much lamb was that and how many is this going to serve so this is 500 grams Atlantic's how easy do all portions because white something all the sauce and the plate a toes it bulbs the whole dish out yeah they turned a burger you'd want you know good 200 grams of meat and ain't count burger something pretty much get away with a half back and you're making a dish like this it's quite cost-effective - all right I'm really try to keep the heat up high on that you want some good color on that lamb while we wait for the meat cook we can crack on with our spuds this is for the creamy mash so if I quickly peel these and then all we want to do is chunk them up into pea says that golf ball-sized some people cutting up a lot smaller which means up cook quicker but they take on a lot of water and become quite waterlogged it's a wet match rather than a nice creamy mesh I chose a marriage piper to use because I think it just needs a fluffier mesh as well Marisa Piper I don't know it's type of potato but you can just get white potatoes now they call in just generic white potatoes or often supermarkets actually labeled off as what they're good for all these spuds can go into our cold salted water and the reason it's cold I guess another tip as to how to make nan lumpy mashed potato you wanna cook all the way through so it's a really hard vegetable you start with cold or lukewarm water and as it comes up to a boil it starts to cook right through the core before the outsides get overcooked so bring that up to a boil and they need to simmer for a good 15 or 20 minutes until they cook the way through test them with a knife right now our shepherd's pie that lamb mixture nice and cooked all the way through and golden colors starting to fall we can add in all of our sauce ingredients so lamb stock and tomato puree next up tomato passata now this isn't quite so traditional traditionally it would just be lamb stock a lot more of it and juiced right down but when you guys with the factory Jamie did the flavor combination said it works really well with tomatoes they leave Paris tomato yeah Bloody Marys things like that so it's a lot softer going in there and finally we need to add in some Lea and Perrins so generous splash that goes in there and then just before we leave it to simmer gently for about an hour we add in a bit more water now the reason is we put the stock cube in so this is kind of the balance of that that will get evaporated off and you'll still be left in the same consistency you started with accepts her chance all that meat to cook down and soften so all going to do is leave our potatoes to cook for 15 minutes or so then we'll drain them and mash them adding in butter and milk and this needs to cook out for an hour or so before constructor shops this is the shepherd's pie mixture that we made earlier it's also had time to cool but you can see how much thicker that is now and here are potatoes so they've been trained you can start to mash those and all we need to add to that is plenty of milk you want this super super creamy and a good knob of butter what you do need to make sure you do is to season it so pinch of salt yeah white pepper if you don't want the specks why should quite light little specks in there and then it can go on to our chef spike this doesn't have to be cold makes this stage a lot easier okay and then one other thing I think it's absolutely beautiful and that's a cheesy mash but we're going to go for a little bit of blue cheese because the savory your mommy favorite blue cheese grate with all those other flavors in there that tomato Liam herrings you're not even going to grate over now just a little bit cuz it all melts in the oven now that can go into an oven 180 degrees for half an hour to crisp up a good goal just a few very simple peas keep the veg nice and simple because all the flavor is here that's crisp up nicely it smells amazing is our shepherd's pie with a dash of Liam parents sorted man that's good oh that is good it is a family favorite thrown through and if you want to give it a go at home then click below for the full recipe
