 Moomba is well-known for adding twists and turns to authentic food from across the country and those are is one such recipe which is highly experimented with so in this episode I'm gonna make miso masala dosa which is popular on the streets of Mumbai so let's see how I'm going to start with heating a dollop of butter once the butter is melted I'm going to add some curry leaves finely chopped onions I'm sure you're wondering why am i cooking the onions and everything in a pan separately generally the filling is directly made onto the dosa but there are two reasons why I'm not doing that one you have to use a lot of butter and second they use a very thick pan which normally everybody doesn't have at home that's why I make the filling separately once the onions are soft I'm going to add some finely chopped capsicum deseeded and finely chopped tomatoes green chillies salt ities sambar masala cook these mixtures of the tomatoes are nice and soft some coarsely mashed potatoes all you've made the aloo Wadi you can even add that smash everything a little bit and I'm also going to add some coconut chutney and coriander leaves mix it well and the filling for the dosa is ready [Music] I'm gonna taste it for the seasoning it's perfect now let's just make the dosa eat a flat pan for at least three to four minutes on the flame and now let's get it off the flame let's spread a ladle full of batter on the pan turn the spoon in a circular motion let's get the pan back on the flame and on high flame cook the dosa always remember to clean the pan after making every dosa it also helps in bringing down the temperature of the pan once the batter dries out a little bit I'm going to spread a little bit of the butter some of the filling I'm also going to add just a little bit of butter mix it properly with the filling and spread the filling all around the dosa grate some cheese if you like let's get the dosa out [Music] let's flip it over and I'm also going to garnish it with a little bit of cheese let's get it out on a plate I'm going to continue making these lovely dosas since my crew members are very hungry now that you know how easy it is to make the mess or masala dosa why don't you take this Mumbai Street food to your own kitchen till then subscribe to the channel see you next time ciao [Music] you
