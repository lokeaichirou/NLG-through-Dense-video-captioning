 today on Nico's kitchen these onion rings are going to be some of the best you've ever had we're making my deep-fried onion rings so first of all we're going to make our batter and this is really really simple and super tasty just into a large bowl I've got some plain flour that I'm going to be adding in I'm going to season the flour with some salt and pepper now this next ingredient isn't just for flavor it's for color as well and I've got some curry powder and I'm just going to add in some curry powder and it just gives the better a wonderful color but also some great flavor it doesn't overdo it with the heat it's extremely mild so just get a fork mix the flour around just make a well in the middle now we're going to be cracking one egg straight in now next I'm going to be adding in some cider now if you wanted to use beer you could I actually really love the crisp flavor of side up if you want a non-alcoholic version just use some soda water you want it nice and bubbly that's going to give our batter some nice airiness to it and make sure make sure whatever you're using it is ice-cold so just using a whisk we just want to give this a good mix around and that is exactly what I'm after it's not so thick it's not too runny it's perfect so of course we've got some onions that I've just cut into rings and all we want to do is just cover them in that batter and now we can deep-fry them to deep-fry heat up some vegetable oil or use a deep fryer carefully placing the onion rings and fry for 1 minute or until crispy and golden brown drain the excess oil on a paper towel and serve immediately now all we have to do is get stuck into these bed so like I said before I just love the color of these and what the curry powder actually does not just for flavor but also for looks as well I love love the color of them so beautiful and crispy spice really well on that cider really really goes well but like I said if you want to use soda water and have them non-alcoholic go for it because essentially what you want is some bubbles in there you want something that's going to give that better a nice crispy texture please give these ago they will not last long let me tell you you put some of these bad daddies down and they'll be gone in no time
