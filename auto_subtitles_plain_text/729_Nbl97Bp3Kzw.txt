 I lived on top of the hill but every day I go down to the village to buy the food that I'm gonna cook that night welcome to what's left of the italian-american neighborhood in San Francisco I'm Johnny and this is my North Beach [Music] I'm cooking calamari fritti I'm gonna do some fried squid for you today very simple it's very quick and I wanted to try to get another fish recipe for you because we're coming close to the Christmas season and you know I'm gonna do a post about the the Italian tradition of seven fish dinner so this calamari fritti is one that I always include in my Christmas Eve seven fish dinner I'm gonna make it for you today we got some local Monterey squid fresh really beautiful I've got some of the tubes that I'm just gonna slice in rings and a lot of people they don't like tentacles I love the tentacles this is a more flavorful part of the of the calamari so I'm gonna I'm gonna fry those up too the only thing I'm gonna do is dredge these in flour and I'm just putting some freshly ground black pepper in this flour and I'm gonna give it a fairly good amount of my Sicilian sea salt so these are vinegar peppers I'm gonna take a couple of these because they're pretty color and I'm gonna take one of these firecrackers one of these Calabria not peppers are gonna mix them together we're gonna put them in that saute pan with a little oil figure these would be nice festive colors let me see if they still taste good mmm but I want to get a little bit more heat than what I'm getting from the vinegar in those vinegar peppers so I'm gonna slice this one up seeds and all now if you're using these Calabria peppers at least when I use it I gotta warn people were eating these dishes because this could get hot so I said I want a confetti so I'm just going this way in these slices got a little smaller pieces we're gonna let this come to temp a little bit and then we're just gonna saute these a little bit and put them aside that should be fun though so we'll let these just kind of mellow out a little bit in the oil get a little color in the oil and bring these peppers up to the temp so that's pretty much where I'm gonna we're gonna leave them I'm gonna put them on the side here see I don't want all this excess in there because that flowers just going to burn so as I put it in I'm gonna be tapping it off at the hole and the oils at the right temperature so I want to get this in it's gonna fry very quickly [Music] but this is a pretty quick process so if you get your heat going at the right temperature you want to get this in and you want to get them right up quickly so see how they're just starting to take on that color just a light tan they just need another minute or so not even a minute and we're gonna take them out see that you just want to cook through but you don't want to overcook because then they're gonna tend to get to get tough just picked up a little bit to see that the very light tan color that's what we're looking for and he's gonna be good eating there's one of those tentacles okay so here we go so these things usually if I'm finding these on for you know for the seven fish dinner people are going to come around we're gonna sprinkle this with salt and they're gonna eat them right here they never make it to the table so maybe we'll have to do that over here too let me put some over here look at this beautiful beautiful beautiful okay now I think I'm gonna have enough flavor here from these peppers that I don't need to squeeze it a lemon but you could always do that if you want let me just taste a couple for you grab this one a little bit of the pepper mmm freshness to the see how quick was this took me about five minutes to make up for you right I got out one of these is my favorite part [Music] Christmases comments I'm a foreigner Christmas Eve you gotta make all of my defeat [Music]
