 hanging on Showtime and making tempura shrimp last couple video I used a tempura batter and some people told me that they can I get that ingredient so I'm gonna show you how to make it from scratch so first I have this ocean daughter shrimp very fresh with shout just the 21 count which is pretty good-sized so we're gonna kill to show off first and what I like to do is I want to save the tail the reason is easy for you to grab to dip in and fry after you peel the show right and there's a vein in the back here you just use a toothpick or anything just kinda like this scoop it out like that alright pretty simple thing to do see ya in out and use some salt like a paper towel next you see this firm here we wanted to keep them a lot a little cup here just halfway like that the reason is because once the strength cook they tend to see wanting to curve in right so if we cut here and then you turn around and keep them a quick push gently push the feeler shrimp meet a very tender like this sit outside and you move to work on your next one this one's a good size so watch me just hop halfway and don't cut through sit down and keep them a quick push that now this trim is done cutting I'm gonna add a pinch of salt and black pepper here I have one cup of all-purpose flour 1/2 cup of corn starch and then we're gonna use ice water to mix it in that gifted when you fry the tempura shrimp will give them a nice crispy coal batter and hot oil the reaction give you super crispy and here I got a little bit of sunflower all-purpose flour we're gonna use the shrimp to dip it in and with the batter and fry so now let's see I'm gonna crack one egg and then we're gonna get them a quick stir a pinch of salt my pepper option let's see how much water do we need usually I go by the texture oh my god I see you inside no big deal we're gonna use to have tap them first give them a quick mix so I have about one and a half cup of ice water three to full cube of ice mix the end well evenly you can have a little lump it's okay welcome brush rims okay I will say the texture like pancake texture here's a vegetable cooking oil 340 degrees very hot so we got the best time make some batter first at that tripping me let's see how I do it and then quickly get one shrimp drip some flour and the batter and then put it right here on the top trying to connect with all those little from and then at the contour to the external like that so we're gonna add some batter in first and then dip it in still around so we couldn't make it lots of batter first you see that and then you dip with your shrimp in just like that floating on the top of those batter right and then we're just gonna slowly mix that batter in together with our sperm like this so they will tied it together okay simple as that see that don't think about couple minutes to cry now we're just gonna let them fry until like crispy hey pretty quick as I say two minutes the most and then I have a paper towel and a tray here just set it up tempura Crump at the sushi restaurant they charge you right I save a huge bowl see before Super Bowl you can make this some Super Bowl recipe too actually if you go to my channel I do have a lot of Super Bowl recipe also about the smoke pipe right oh this one dialogic one which is beautiful it's crispy very crispy you hear that very crispy here very super crispy here we go and then you make your own sauce okay any stocks that you like if you I just like like this crispy just come home from a deep fryer beautiful I hope you like a video I'm chef Tom thank you for watching and you can make this for your shrimp tempura with a little soup or you can make this for any kind of party tray or duping with any kind of cocktail sauce and you sauce in your life come on stay on yep hope you liked the video I'm chef Tom thank you for watching bye
