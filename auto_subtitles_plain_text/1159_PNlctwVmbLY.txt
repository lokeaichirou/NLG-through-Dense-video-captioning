 Muenster it's a day I hope I convinced you guys not to throw everything out and to compost and if you can't compost it try to eat it such as this watermelon rinds there's an abundance of it right now and it's my favorite fruit so instead of throwing away the brine I've used the outer green part compost fat in the inner part to make a really light crunchy and refreshing and easier version of suits you watermelon is my favorite fruits so the fruit part the meat part of it is my favorite part but the part we're looking for here is that inner white rind so this is like a perfect recession food nothing gets thrown away so using an ice cream soup I want to scoop out all the meat and put it in a bowl and I love bread blending chunks of frozen watermelon with some agave and some wine and doing kind of like a watermelon slush in the summertime it's so delicious so this will definitely be eaten but like I said we're looking for that white rinds part so I'm gonna scoop all of this out second step is to shave off all the outer green bits so you want to make sure you scrub your watermelon pretty well because a lot of people have handled it so just for sanitary reasons but this is what the inside looks like I have scraped it all of its juicy and crunchy juicy bits and you want to take a sharp knife and you want to start shaving away at it so I like to take the top part off like this and don't forget to compost this stuff every bit of this cacophony all parts of this watermelon can be used so it's just a great way to reduce waste too and then just shave down kind of like you would when you segment in orange just like that and then just keep working down for making little strips until your entire watermelon is left with just the white now I just want to cut little strips into the so cut it down in half and let's see let's cut this in half as well and then just that and maybe make little cuts like your best little strips like that I've tumbled all my little shards into a bowl and I want to sprinkle over with some coarse sea salt kosher or table or fine salt will not work here so you want to make sure you get your hands on some coarse sea salt and use your hands and kind of massage it and the purpose for this is for it to draw out all that extra specks of excess moisture chips off today I'm fumbling around my words yeah because it's a very juicy fruit it's going to still be a pretty juicy finished product when you bite into it'll be crisp and refreshing but it'll draw out and extract all that extra moisture so you want to kind of sit in this salt for about an hour or so well my rided hanging out it gives me ample time to make my paste so it's in the bowl I want to add in my finely minced garlic my finely minced ginger and then quote ricotta which is the pepper flakes the Korean pepper flakes not the powder just like that in as well and then I have some green onions and you can use sugar agave or honey I'm using honey because I have an abundance of honey today so I'm going to drop that in there and optionally you can also use some anchovies or some brine shrimp and I'm going to mix this together and set it aside until my wine is ready to be mix with it I have trained and rinsed my rice so it's just a matter of meshing the paste into my little slivers so I'm going to tumble in all of that paste into my big bowl with the rinds and I just drained and rinsed it if you like that brain√≠s and that salty bite doesn't bother you I just took a bite of it if it doesn't bother you just kind of let it sit and it'll act as kind of like a sauce to kind of combine everything together but I trained in rinsed because it is a little bit salty for me you can always add a little bit of salt back in later but she can't take it back out so you want to toss this mixture for about three to four minutes until everything is nicely combined and the pastes have kind of melted the heat from your hand has melted that paste into the watermelon rinds my favorite way to eat kimchi would have to be with some steamed rice and some grilled mackerel some type of protein a little bit of like sticky rice and maybe a soup with you too but I'm going to go in here and just try this because I didn't sneak a bite while I was mixing it so it'll be a complete surprise to see how it turned out it has got such a nice salty bite and it's got the flavor and all the essence of coochie but as we saw QT either in the flash and we utilize something that may have been returned away or put in the compass teeth it's delicious crunchy and refreshing I hope you guys give this a try I wanna thank you guys for hanging out me this is the fishy monster and on v.i.c
