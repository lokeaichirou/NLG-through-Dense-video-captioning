 love this is chef john from food wishes comm with buffalo bacon meatloaf that's right this magnificent loaf of meat features delicious and nutritious buffalo and as if that wasn't enough we're also going to cover it with America's most ubiquitous breakfast meat bacon and by the way I'm not one of these people that will just add bacon to anything I mean people go crazy with this stuff I once saw a woman wearing a dress made out of bacon although I do have to admit she did look delicious but anyway there's nothing gratuitous about its addition here as it's going to provide some much-needed fat and of course flavor but anyway let's get this started by cooking some of the aforementioned bacon in some butter oh yeah that's always a good way to start a recipe so we'll cook some sliced up bacon and a little bit of butter and a skillet set over medium heat and we want to cook this almost but not quite crisp which is of course going to take five or ten minutes so keep an eye in it but while that's working we can go ahead and get our vegetables together so in a bowl I have a beautiful array vegetables featuring onions carrots and celery we're also going to do some mushrooms and some pepper I have two kinds I'm gonna use some red and a green poblano and I think we'll also throw in a few cloves of garlic that should be goodness and what we'll do is we'll cook these vegetables in that bacon butter mixture but not like this what we want to do first is grind these in the food processor fairly small all right we don't want a super wet puree but we do want to pulse on and off until we have something pretty fine and by the way anytime you're doing something like this make sure you stop a couple times and take a spatula and scrape down your sides so everything ends up about the same size so we keep blitzing on and off until we end up with something that looks like this so like I said we're going to grind it pretty small but we don't want a big soupy mess here so go to fine make it look like this and by now hopefully that bacon that's been cooking in the butter on medium is ready so at this point we'll go ahead and transfer the vegetables into our pan and we'll cook those turn occasionally until they soften and sweeten up for about five minutes or so all right we're not trying to caramelize them or brown them but we do want to take the riot off and while that's happening I am going to add a small pinch of dried rosemary I generally don't like a really OB meatloaf but we will stir in a little bit of dried rosemary because that's going to work really well with the bacon in the Buffalo and then like I said we'll cook that for about five minutes until it softens up and kind of looks like this and it's hard to tell by looks but if you were to taste a little bit of this it would not taste raw so that's looking good at that we will turn off the heat and move on to the breadcrumb stage swimmable I have a couple cups of fresh breadcrumbs those are not dry that's just the inside of a day-old loaf of Italian or French bread and of course you can do that in your food processor also I just broke them up with my hands and what we'll do is we'll add our cooked vegetable mixture to these crumbs along with a splash of whole milk and we'll give that a very thorough mixing before we have the rest of the ingredients speaking of which we don't want to add those if this mixture is really hot so once we mix this up we should probably let it cool to room temp before adding the rest of the ingredients now did I not really I lit a cool little but it was still kind of warm but officially let it cool to room temp and then once that does cool down we will proceed with the rest of the ingredients which include some freshly ground black pepper and some salt of course we also want to give it a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce as well as one large egg and then let's do just a little shaker Cayenne or big shake up to you you are the meatloaf of your meatloaf and then what we'll do is we'll give this a mix before adding the star of the show the Buffalo and by the way while it is nutritious and delicious ground Buffalo does provide a couple challenges it's generally very very lean and for whatever reason it's sold ground very finely are two things that aren't necessarily great if you're making meatloaf so to counter that that's why we're doing the recipe with fresh breadcrumbs and all those vegetables this way despite the issues with the buffalo meat we're still going to get a very juicy very moist loaf so we'll toss in a couple pounds and we'll mix that all together I'm going to use my bare hands is it's the best tool for this and once we do have this all mixed together we will transfer it into a lightly greased baking dish and form it into your classic meatloaf shape what is that four or five inches wide three or four inches high and at this point if you were just making regular meatloaf you just toss it in the oven but we're not we are going to shroud this in bacon and if you do shape yours into a similar size one strip of thick cut bacon should fit perfectly over the top with just enough on either end to tuck it in so we'll cover that in bacon then as you can see if need be you can use the tip of a knife to kind of finish pushing that bacon underneath and that is looking bacon-wrapped and ready for the oven so at this point we can transfer our meatloaf into the center of a preheated 350 degree oven for about an hour or until done as you shoot for an internal temp of about 155 and by the way if you want about halfway through we can pull out the meatloaf and baste it with a glaze and yes the step is optional but I do it because I'm all about that baste bout that baste it's no trouble just takes a minute so I'm gonna brush over a very simple brown sugar glaze I'll give you the recipe on the blog but it's just rice vinegar brown sugar and mustard and once that's been applied we can go ahead and pop that back in until like I said we have an internal temp of about 1:55 at which point we'll pull it out and you should be looking at one of the most beautiful Meat Loaf's you've ever seen and then I know it's not going to be easy but you really do want to let this sit for at least ten minutes before you cut into it but I was starving I wanted to finish the video so I sliced right in and as you can hopefully see from this shot we have a meatloaf that's not only beautiful on the outside but incredibly tender and moist on the inside I mean look how juicy that is so let me go ahead and cut off one nice big slice and serve it up properly next to some veggies and mashed potatoes along with some classic mushroom gravy by the way mushroom gravy sold separately I know we have a video for that or you could just make a gravy with the drippings and I hope it's pretty obvious to see how incredibly moist and tender this meatloaf really is it really does melt in your mouth and of course the bacon helped and what is Buffalo taste like pretty much exactly like grass-fed beef and what does grass-fed beef taste like pretty much like corn-fed beef except maybe the tiniest tiniest bit more gamey and I mean really tiny you probably won't even notice it okay so Buffalo is nothing to be afraid of unless of course you're talking about an actual live Buffalo they can kill you but as far as ground Buffalo meat goes there's nothing to fear as I hopefully showed you here so I really do hope you give this a try head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
