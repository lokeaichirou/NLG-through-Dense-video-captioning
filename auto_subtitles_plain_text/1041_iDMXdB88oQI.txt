 hi everyone welcome to feast in the Middle East my name is Blanche and I'm going to show you how to cook middle-eastern food fast easy and the modern way now how do I do that I'm going to show you shortcuts today we're going to talk about a salad called fattoush now fattoush is actually an Arab word that means pieces of something little bits of something so in this case in this salad we're going to use bits of bread pita bread that we're going to bake and form into croutons for the salad so it's kind of like a bread and vegetable salad it's kind of close to panzanella which is Italian version of this salad so with that said we are going to start with the veggies with this salad you want to use vegetables that are in season right now I happen to have some amazing tomatoes and cucumbers so we're going to add about two cucumbers that already slice these are the Persian style cucumbers which don't have the big seeds oops I should probably take out the cutlery here traditionally the salad uses green bell pepper but I love red so I'm going to put red bell pepper in here so the salt is going to have tons of vitamin C and these are the tomatoes for my backyard so I have about three small chopped tomatoes you could use Roma or beefsteak whatever kind of tomatoes you like and then for the herbs this is really key for this salad I have some finely chopped parsley about a handful of chopped parsley 1/2 a cup probably and I have another 1/4 cup or 1/3 cup of chopped mint now this is actually the basil of the Middle East Italians like to use basil we like to use mint so that's how it's a lot different from panzanella so we're going to use some mint and to give it a nice fresh taste we're going to put some green onions probably about three chopped you might be thinking this is kind of close to tabouleh which is in another one of my videos it's kind of different because the vegetables are a lot bigger and we use the bread which I'll show you how I'm going to prepare in a few now this is I use purple onion this is traditionally what's used not white onion but purple I think this really makes a difference in this salad I use about 1/2 of a 1 and about 1 clove of garlic that's been chopped you could use more if you want but I have about 1 clove that's been chopped ok so this is the basis of this salad it's beautiful and colorful so far I haven't even started with the dressing but what we're going to do is talk about the croutons of the salad which comes from pita bread because that's what we like to eat in the Middle East a lot of pita bread but a lot of it goes stale so this was a great way to think of how another use for stale pita bread instead of throwing it away they came up with this so I have whole-wheat pita bread because I like to use whole wheat if you're a low-carb person you can use sprouted tortillas if you want for a change so I have a whole wheat pita bread that's been cut into squares and actually stale bread works better it turns out crispier in the oven and I'm going to put actually a little bit of garlic powder too to season it and salt so here's some salt just put some on there I have some garlic powder in here I believe yes I do so here's some garlic powder just a little sprinkle you don't want to drown the stuff in garlic powder and some olive oil about two tablespoons now traditionally this salad was made by deep-frying the bread but what is the point of eating the salad if you are going to deep fry the bread right I mean you want this to be a healthy salad so this is my adaptation my modern adaptation of the salad and it actually don't sacrifice flavor so I'm just stirring this up and I'm just going to put this in a pan and I'm going to bake it until it's browned and crispy so here we are we're going to put this in a nice sheet and I have the oven set for 400 degrees and it only takes about 6 minutes to cook up nice and brown so I'm going to just put this in the oven right now okay so my croutons are nice and crispy now you can use store-bought pita chips if you want but why bother if you can make it so quickly and easily at home a lot of other times those pita chips have a lot of funky oils in there that I wouldn't want putting it in my food and they also put too much sodium so this way I can control how much sodium how much fat goes into my croutons so that's that now we're going to go back to the salad we're going to make the dressing it's just so easy it's ridiculous basically I've got the juice of one lemon already squeezed into this bowl I'm going to add about two tablespoons of olive oil and to that I'm going to add some Mac now so Mac is that beautiful purple spice that's made from a berry and it gives it a nice tangy flavor so I'm going to add that and I'm just going to whisk it doesn't take long I don't need any fancy contraptions this is this is a salad dressing folks it doesn't get simpler than this so the sumac is really what makes this salad a lot different than tabouleh as well so anyway we're going to add this to the vegetables look how gorgeous this is and it smells so good it's got a really nice fresh flavor and now we're just going to add some salt to taste and then finally we're going to add some of the croutons so I'm just going to grab a handful toss it in and it makes a beautiful hearty salad it can be a complete meal if you add some kidney beans garbanzo beans chicken whatever kind of protein you like and it makes a beautiful complete meal and it's really pretty to look at thank you so much for joining me here on feasts in
