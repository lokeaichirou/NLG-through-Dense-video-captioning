 breakfast is not complete without a gray hash brown and this is how you make it it's really really simple you get yourself a nice big pot of potatoes and salted water okay so I'm just gonna pour my potatoes in there it can be cold a generous pinch of salt we cook them until they're are about 3/4 of the way through so it'll be about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of your potato so we bring it to a rolling boil I'm gonna grate them when they're three quarters of the way cooked okay still warm I'm gonna mix it with a little bit of corn starch or corn flour some fresh thyme leaves which I've got over here you won't need much salt because we're cooking it in quite heavily salted water and that's it it's really really a simple recipe okay I've got some potatoes that are already cooking you want to check that there's sort of three quarters of the way course so get yourself a little secure poke it in you should still feel some resistance you don't want them fully cooked and these are just there so I'm gonna pull them out you let them steam dry for just a minute or two until they're sort of cool after handle and then you're gonna grate them so I've got my semi cooked potatoes here what I've got is a box grater and a little bit of parchment paper so you literally just you can do this really roughly but you can even hear the texture see the propeller still rather firm in the center which is what you want because it is semi coated in my bowl the reason I do it on this little bit of parchment is simply because you can just pick up the piece of paper and take it straight over and then you can mix just a little flavor through so I've got some fresh thyme leaves sprinkle those in lovely perfume just a little bit of salt we already put some salt in the in the cooking liquid so you don't need too much just a couple of tablespoons of corn flour two or three tablespoons full then you just sort of mix that together and you'll see the moisture of the potato will actually eventually take on all of that corn flour that we put in there right so once you have your mix complete what you want to do is just set it to one side get yourself a tray you can take that little bit of parchment paper that you used earlier and just sort of lay that on the bottom of your on the bottom of your tray then you put your potatoes on top of the paper and then you just sort of press them into the tray you ought to be really nice and firm now of course the thickness of this potato will be the thickness of your hash browns so we're not coating it in anything it's going to be that that thick so if you want them nice and thick then of course you can leave the layer a little thicker I take one more piece of parchment on the top and just kind of smooth it out it's that simple you pop it into the fridge once it's cold you can cut it into any shape you want and then we just cook them in a little bit of vegetable oil really crispy and really delicious so our potatoes are in the fridge they've been there for about 20 minutes so they should be nice and cool let's take a look perfect so you just want to make sure that they're firmed up and they are nice and cool and then this is how you get them out flip it over then I'm gonna go down here I just cut it into nice long strips you can turn it this is why I keep it on the parchment paper because it gives you a good sort of remove ability I'm gonna cut them in squares now if you want to cut them from there into triangles you can you know really whatever shapes you like next you get a hot pan so I've got a pan over here with just a little bit of oil move that around you can use a little butter as well so the oil of course allows you to get it to a slightly higher temperature and the butter gives you that beautiful flavor once your hash browns are golden on both sides you can lift them up to sit them straight onto some absorbent paper the beautiful thing about these hash browns is they're super crispy on the outside but on the inside they're still delicious and fluffy give them just a second on the paper and then you can pick them up and just stick them straight onto a plate of course they're the perfect thing to serve with some fried eggs and bacon or grilled tomatoes you can also serve them with a hot chili sauce or even an apple sauce and sour cream is so many different ways to enjoy hashbrowns now you know how to make him get busy
