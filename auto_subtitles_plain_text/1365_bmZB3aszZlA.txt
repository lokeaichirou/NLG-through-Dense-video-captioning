 everyone is chilly today we'll be making one of my favorite childhood dishes spaghetti and meatballs super easy and delicious almost every person on planet earth enjoys a delicious bowl of spaghetti and meatballs at least once a year right right so let's get started so I used a saute pan with high sides to make my sauce drizzled a little bit of olive oil and throw in my chopped onions i sauteed the onions on medium-low heat about three minutes make sure not to burn them and then add in your minced garlic after I threw in the garlic I seasoned it with a pinch of salt and pepper then I threw in the fresh basil do not saute the garlic for more than 15 to 20 seconds garlic burns extremely quickly I like to use one can of peeled tomatoes and one can of crushed Tomatoes you can do both cans of crushed tomatoes but I do like the sauce to be a little bit chunky and you won't get a chunky sauce from a can of crushed tomatoes poured in it add a cup of water to loosen it up a bit I took a potato masher or in this case a tomato masher and I mashed up those tomatoes even though you mash the tomatoes you're still going to have little chunks of tomatoes floating around your sauce and that's what I love ironically I hated those chunks of tomatoes in my sauce when I was a kid I also hated fruit chunks in my yogurt as a kid things really change when you get older though i season them with salt pepper oregano and a little bit of sugar tomatoes can be a bit sour and the sugar will help with that some people recommend adding half of a grated carrot carrots are sweet but sugar works for me I really tried looking for the lid of this pan I couldn't find it so I use aluminum foil and then I lowered the heat to medium low so while the sauce was simmering I started making my meatballs I used a blend of beef pork and veal I broke it up with my fingers you may use a fork if you don't want to use a blend of beef pork and veal you can use beef by itself and they will be delicious as well here I have one slice of bread that I placed in my food processor I added it to my beast you can just break it up with your fingers I threw in some parsley fresh garlic I didn't use onions since the sauce already has onions I know it has garlic too but you can never have enough garlic an egg some milk to moisten things up a bit a little bit of chili powder I like the kick it gives lots of Parmesan cheese and make sure to season this well with salt and pepper and now I did mention earlier that spaghetti and meatballs was my favourite childhood dish I used to make it all the time by myself while I watched Nickelodeon if you're wondering how I made it back then towards Chef Boyardee manhunt truth or dare Monopoly pool Marco Polo Doug and Rugrats there was just no time for cooking when I was a kid to all my young viewers making all of these recipes you guys seriously Rock already know if a boring mix the meat until everything is incorporated but make sure not to over mix and now if you're a beginner cook you might struggle with the salt and pepper to taste when things are raw like this so a little tip I could give you is to fry a little piece like I showed you or one meatball before you start rolling all of them the worst thing you can do is serve your guests under seasoned food so that's optional to do I rolled little meatballs like this you may make the mess little or as big as you like whatever size you prefer just make sure they're all the same size so they all cook evenly then a skillet with some vegetable oil I fried the meatballs for about three to four minutes on each side over a medium-high heat the inside will still be raw but I like to finish cooking them in the sauce they are pretty small so I just rocked my skillet back and forth and they'll just flip over on their own if they're bigger you can always use some tongs to flip them over my sauce has been simmering for about 20 minutes or so I like to add some extra fresh basil I place the meatballs into the pan and I let them simmer in the sauce for an additional 20 minutes or so covered and funny thing is I loved spaghetti and meatballs so much as a kid then when I went to restaurants with my parents I would always order spaghetti and meatballs and they would cringe oh well I couldn't get enough alright so I placed a spaghetti into my pan I don't like to so diner style diner style they just ladle the sauce onto your pasta and they don't completely drain the pasta so I like to mix the pasta with the sauce during the pasta really well I just don't prefer it watery so this is how I served it it was completely drenched in the sauce which I loved and it was a bit messy but I cleaned it off later I like to serve three to four meatballs per person but of course it all depends on the actual person my brother prefers six to seven meatballs so then I just subtract meatballs from his girlfriend's plate just kidding I grated some fresh parmesan on top so this in total should take about 45 minutes to make but it's so worth it the kids will love it you will love it I place two basil leaves on top to make it look cute I hope you guys really give this recipe a try hope
