 hi I'm Mike Lee and welcome to India Food Network firstly I want to thank all the viewers from all over the world for giving me some fantastic feedback I am so glad that you are watching my videos and enjoying my recipes so today I am going to do a very traditional recipe which is the vegetable and mint Shahi biryani now biryani is can be very daunting with loads of ingredients and cooking techniques but I assure you though the ingredient list is quite big it is very simple to make so to know more about this recipe stay tuned to India Food Network so though the ingredient list is really long the cooking technique is very simple and I assure you that the biryani will be ready in no time so let's see what the ingredients are here I have two cups of rice that have cooked it some salted water and added some saffron to it here I have half a cup of potatoes that I fried about one and a half cups of boiled vegetables like cauliflower carrots peas french beans about half a cup of fried onions some fried cashew nuts soaked raisins one tomato which I've chopped some fresh mint coriander 1 cup of yogurt 2 tablespoons of fresh cream 2 tablespoons of grated cheese quarter teaspoon of healthy or turmeric 1 TSP of red chili powder 2 teaspoons of gana jeera powder about one to one and a half teaspoons of biryani masala about two teaspoons of ginger garlic which I've chopped some salt to taste and two tablespoons of oil so after all these ingredients let's find out how to make this quick biryani so because the ingredient list is so long what I do is I just plop all these ingredients into one big bowl and marinate the vegetables so first let's get the vegetables in this bowl and now I'm going to add the yogurt the fresh cream the cheese then the mint of course the most important ingredient some nice freshly chopped coriander which gives all the freshness quarter teaspoon of healthy or turmeric 1 teaspoon of chili powder 2 teaspoons of Danah jeera powder about 1 teaspoon to one and a half teaspoons of biryani masala some salt to taste and of course the tomatoes so now I'm going to simply mix all these ingredients so that they mix and blend well now last add the potatoes because we don't want them to get too soggy and a bit of the onions maybe a tablespoon or so okay so really there are two ways of doing this very Ani you can just layer these vegetables as is in a pot or a pan that you are making your biryani in and then just layer the rice over it and let cook cover for about 30 to 40 minutes on a low flame so you don't have to wait and watch and you can sip a wine while your biryani is working just remember to place a pan underneath the cooking pot so that the heat distributes evenly throughout so now I have marinated the vegetables for a good 15 to 20 minutes so I'm just going to sautee them now so just put it on medium heat I'm going to add two tablespoons of regular vegetable oil you can also add ghee here or butter and once the oil heats up I'm going to add the ginger and the garlic just to remove the rawness from that just saute it for a couple of minutes and now simply flop in all these ingredients into the pan so now I'm going to let these vegetables cook for a good five to six minutes till all the flavors blend in while I prepare the rice for it so you now have some salted cooked rice and in that I've put some sacral so good tip here would be to dissolve the saffron in some milk to make it more rich and so that the color and the flavor spreads evenly so here I have the rice and to this I am going to add some fried onions and just mix it nicely and remember to flavor it with some salt at this point in time otherwise the biryani can get quite bland so now my vegetables are almost cooked here it doesn't take much time because we already parboil our vegetables before so now just spread it evenly in a layer just reduce the temperature to low and now I'm going to simply layer the rice on top so it's got all the goodness of vegetables you can add ricotta cheese you can add some chicken I mean whatever you like finally I'm going to add some soaked raisins so why we add it right now the rice soaks in all the sweetness and gives it a really rich and decadent taste later on and the fried onion and now I'm going to place a foil or any tight container or something on top so now I have placed this foil over the pan just make sure that all the steam gets trapped so now we are going to let this very Ani sit for about 10 to 15 minutes on a very low flame till the entire house is full of the fantastic flavor so after 15 minutes I'm just checking if it's done oh wow it looks fantastic in most divine the final garnish would be to top some fried cashews on top just to make it that royal and Shahi and some really fresh Lee chopped coriander so my vegetable and mention biryani is ready I hope you enjoyed watching this video and I'm sure you're going to try to make it do leave me suggestions and comments
