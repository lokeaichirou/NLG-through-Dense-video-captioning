 the Allrecipes cook who shared this recipe for rich and creamy tomato basil soup broke the secret to the richness of this soup is to use real butter fresh basil leaves and heavy cream first we'll prepare the fresh tomatoes bring a medium pot of water to a boil make an ice bath in a large bowl and set that to the side slit four tomatoes at the bottom making small shallow X's this will aid in the actual peeling of the tomato later now plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water and allow them to cook for about 30 seconds or just until the X begins to peel back and the tomato skin breaks using a spider or a slotted spoon remove the tomatoes and immerse them in an ice bath let the tomatoes sit in the ice bath for at least five minutes now once the tomatoes have chilled peel and discard the tomato skin cut the tomatoes in half scoop the seeds out and discard them then chop the tomatoes in a large stock pot over medium heat add the tomatoes along with four cups of tomato juice and bring to a boil reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes while the tomatoes cook pick and clean 14 leaves of fresh basil you at the end of 30 minutes remove the stock pot from the heat add the fresh basil puree the tomato soup mixture with an immersion blender if you have one now stir in one cup of heavy whipping cream and half a cup of butter return the soup to the heat but keep it from boiling season the soup with salt to taste and pepper to taste once the creamy tomato basil soup is heated through it's ready to serve garnish with fresh basil Allrecipes member curtis says if anybody ever asks for homemade tomato soup of any kind let this be the definitive one it would be hard to do better
