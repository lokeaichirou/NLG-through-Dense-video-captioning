 I have my pan heating over add three tablespoons of olive oil in there add one medium onion that I chopped up I been making this for years and this is one of my favorite I've tried different recipes and I'd like the other recipe you always come back to this there's a medium onion in there about a cup and here is garlic just one kuo put that in there and we're gonna start our stop this way and I'm going to let this just cook and get soft I have the onions they cooked up the go a little Brown there pop Japan was a little bit too hot so I'm going to add a big can of tomatoes 28 ounces and add 6 ounces of tomato paste better there and another six ounces of tomato paste [Music] and then I'm going to add one cup of water I'm just going to go ahead and put the water in this pan and kind of rinse it out and now for the seasonings here is one tablespoon of sugar 1 bay leaf 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt and I also need one and a half teaspoons of flaky oregano leaves oregano and about a half a teaspoon of pepper and you just want to stir this up and cook it for 30 minutes for the meatballs here I have three slices of bread that I have in a a colander strainer like thing and I've run water over it to get it all wet I'm going to take it over here to the sink and squeeze out most of the water and I'm gonna put that in there if you're using the real cheap bread I have three slices there if you're using the real cheap bread and I would use four slices and here is one pound of ground beef and one garlic clove that I chopped up and I'm going to put two eggs in here here is one teaspoon of salt we're going to add dried parsley one teaspoon of dried parsley and oregano 1 teaspoon of dried oregano 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese [Music] and just a little pepper we mix all this up in and make meatballs and fry them up my pens been hating on medium heat I'm gonna add some olive oil in there and here's my bowl with the hamburger the ground beef mixture I'm gonna start making the meatballs and just put them in here and you want to fry these up just slowly not fast or anything just slowly just put them in there probably do the half of them and then you know in two batches god I can't wait to eat this this is gonna be good one of my old old recipes I'm still on my first batch here probably gonna take three batches I just carefully turn them just want to gently cook these and then down on however many sides they turn out to be these are three four sides turn down the pan just a little bit medium heat was just a little too hot you just want cooking slowly [Music] the sauce is simmered for really 45 minutes here's the meatballs I made and I've let the meatballs rest and cool off it cooled off for like 30 minutes 45 minutes because if you don't let them do that they'll kind of break up in the sauce and you won't have meatballs you just have like ground beef in there so put those in there and mix them in gently and you have your spaghetti and meatballs just about that we need to let the meatballs heat up for about 30 minutes [Music] kisum pasta little bit al dente [Music] and the sauce getting meatballs [Music] check that out [Music] and sprinkle with a little bit of parmesan good stuff the cheap stuff whatever [Music] you have a delicious meal I guarantee you this is good thanks so much for watching [Music]
