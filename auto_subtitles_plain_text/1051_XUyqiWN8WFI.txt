 hi I'm Jason I'm Zeebo and we're cooking sorted foods curd cottage pie with spiced parsnip mash yes but instead of potatoes using rutabaga because this guy can't have carbs so let's get to it what have we got Rebecca parsnip flour milk beef stock cumin thyme bay leaf krei powder beef mince or as real people say ground ground beef olive oil billion parents or sugar shop near para which we painstakingly chopped ourselves and tomato paste yes and we have our water boiling so that we can cook our parsnips and our rutabaga and get them ready to mash so we'll let that boil for like ten or fifteen minutes and then we'll come back to it I'm gonna go fight crime okay so we've boiled our parsnips and our rutabaga so we are gonna take these and strain them right over here so we'll go ahead and mash these so that we can make the topping right for the cottage pie toss these not easily I'm sure I'm just gonna watch you into this your fancy culinary or my favorite so we've got our parsnips and rutabaga we're gonna add our milk and our cool actually the fat in the milk cokes the starch in the root vegetables and makes it smoother really so now that we've got our hand mashing done we're gonna go ahead and use a little mixer to get these nice and smooth so transfer them into a higher pan so they don't get all over this oh my god they're still a little dry should we add a little more milk very good I think I'm a little bit clean here anyway I do we got a shot of oil in our pan we're gonna toss it in the mirepoix we'll let that all fry up so we're gonna take the bay leaves we're gonna toss them in there while we're sauteing the mirepoix yes and then once we've been sauteing the mirepoix for a while we can go ahead and toss in the thyme and the beef mince there here we go we'll brown the ground beef and we'll cook everything together for a little while and let everything soak up all those flavors I make sure every file the time I haven't really made a cottage 5/4 and of course cottage pie is the English version of shepherd's pie yes by is made with lamb and fitted so we'll go ahead and toss the flour in there we're pretty pattern and tomato paste in the tube ready so I've got my pre measured beef stock ready to go we'll go ahead and toss that in there don't be glaze a pan nicely little Lea &amp; Perrins in there little Worcestershire sauce not the easiest word to say but I think I said it better than been your sauce we're gonna go ahead and cover this while it simmers for an hour every container with that we are back and our meat mix is done cooking done simmering give a nice final stir oh man that smells amazing so before we go further we want to take the bay leaves out we're gonna grab our baking dish we'll take the meat mixture we'll put this in the bottom of the baking dish get that all shaken out and then we're ready for our parsnips and rutabaga parsnips and rutabaga just lather on there I do have to say it smells pretty amazing and the curry curry the cumin the spices and just the veggies in general to tell the grade it's no great get a nice layer of root vegetables on top of our cottage pie and shove it in the oven good so we're gonna go ahead and toss this in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit or as sort of tells us 200 degrees Celsius I prefer to use Kelvin yes absolutely I cook everything at Absolute Zero I'm ready to go right our cottage pie is done our timer went off we're ready to gram it out of the oven it's all bubbly boy I'm here Forks with each of us careful cause it's super hot there you are so sorted scurry cottage pie the spice personally spiced parsnip mash good twist on the carbine mmm boy is it and really good I think it was a rutabaga I don't think I even notice if there's anything missing right yeah good substitute for mashed taters a little bit of curry powder there gives it just a tiny bit of kick right excellent good job guys we love it
