guys hi oh yeah how you like to say hi in Korean in Korean you can say on your tail and yeah yeah it's pretty standard awful yarn but for you annyeong if you are well yeah that's good and so where are we what are we cooking today we're going to make a very simple dish you can make it like a day in advance you can make it that day but yeah it's a beef yeah I have like a really nice cut of meat here pretty tasty mm-hmm and this is called a GU bogie pool going we're making nice food okey what does it mean cuckoo Buki I guess literally translates to Poona means fire and Kogi is just neat so hire me so fire me cooked meat cook me yeah I like it yeah it's cooked it's me bulgogi people very cool buggy is that easy very very easy we're just going to dump everything together wait and then cook it oh nice recipes sure where do we eat this in Korea like is it for lunch or dinner occasions um it could be for occasions but this is the kind of dish that's just great for you know you could eat it even for breakfast but usually lunch dinner yeah it's like people make it at home and make it at home you go to a restaurant and have it it's very just everywhere it's a very popular Korean oh I'm so excited oh my oh by the way did you guys my Karine imprint but everywhere I already let this was a good yes this is my first time this my friend a she thank you a she how are you okay okay actually mixed up bring another one yeah okay so let's uh I'm full book if they're shredded okay it's alright that's it's done it okay so here we have about a pound of this is a tenderloin you can use sirloin actually you can use any it's so thin exactly because you can't see my face of it you yeah it's just that's the point you can use any kind of meat because it's so thin that even if it's a very tough cut yeah um it'll still be tender because it's so good and if you can't get it very thin that's okay because you just marinate it for longer okay yeah maybe okay it's in like thin slices not very thin and then you marinate it yeah okay that's that okay so first we're going to prepare a few ingredients this is just one carrot we're going to kill it I'm gonna easy very easy okay so we're just going to take a grater and use the biggest holes right Wow nice carrots here next we take a small onion and we're just going to kind of make a puree I use my weight in it with the really small holes yeah so this is how it's gonna look yes it's like a puree of onions basically mmm one more ingredients to prepare the Kiwi Kiwi yeah guys there's Kiwi in this meat yes the Kiwi is actually really great for tenderizing the knee Wow when you told me this I was like really so they use Kiwi to tenderize make meat so it's very soft and it gives a little bit of sugar a little bit of tartness so yeah let's go as often let's do the Kiwi now okay so we have our Kiwi we're going to slice it in half and this is like an avocado okay we're going to take out the meat just going to I'll show remove it with a spoon yeah I'm just taking the skin off and then you have this trick right yeah we're just trying to get a little bit we maybe need like a spoonful two spoonfuls okay so let's do the marinade a first we have the Kiwi and some brown sugar soy sauce garlic minced garlic yeah mmm sesame oil and then we have some onions yeah then grated onion and then some ginger powder yeah we use a lot of ginger in Morocco yes in Korean food as well and then you have some salt to taste maybe like pincher too not too much because we have the soy sauce the soy sauce is very salty there's also just a little bit okay and then the same pepper just a little pinch okay and then we are just going to whisk this together good smells great it smells ginger and sweet at the same time all of these flavors are going to the meat and just make it super super flavorful so now we add the vegetables onions okay we graded the green onion ooh and you got like this funky mushroom look at this shiitake mushrooms shiitake mushrooms yeah funky mushrooms but you can use any mushroom that you have or if you don't have mushrooms you just don't have to put them in and then we're just going to mix it all together we're going to throw in the meat as well YUM and look at that and we're just going to get it all together moroccans that hand-mixing just to make sure the marinade gets all over the meat and everything's really well coated okay well that looks pretty well mix oh that's good so we just marinate it in the fridge yes you can do it in the fridge for like 30 minutes and I asked you a day Oh fit that you don't have to worry about marrying it for very long oh so you can't do 30 minutes where you can make it the night before and then cook it for dinner the next day sure that's a perfect like easy dinner to even freeze it and then cook it like a month later oh you can freeze it too and quick it later okay now I put it in the fridge and then we cook it later okay so this is what we have here after what's it been like 30 minutes 30 minutes we marinated it for 13 yummy yeah you can see some of the sauce has started to kind of gather and that's gonna be real and the meat is like it tastes colors and it looks like the spice is in mm-hmm yeah it ate up drink up some of that marinade yeah yeah so we cook it down and it's good yep we're just gonna heat up a skillet and it's very quick very thinly sliced so it's not gonna take very long okay cool this is it okay so we're just heating up the skillet throwing in some vegetable oil and then in goes the Prugo ghee Wow the ceiling has to be hot right yes you wanted to be sizzling now me and this cooks very quickly so you don't have to really worry about overcrowding move it around everything cooked so you can see that it's cooking really quickly and almost done and this juice here you don't want to drain any of that best like a sauce so keep some of the Judith here to sit and when you put that on rice the rice soaks in those juices and it's the flavor it's just amazing yeah this is basically ready but it's like two minutes right it's very very quick and you don't want to overcook it because then the meats gonna turn top okay so we're just going to transfer this to a serving dish yeah it smells amazing it only took like two or three minutes to go it's clearly last yep okay so in Korea we just take a little bit of lettuce and put in some of the meat no we have this like yes Korean toss this is a coach's on you can use sometimes done and just put a little bit probably put too much this is a mess out here that's a big piece you're gonna
