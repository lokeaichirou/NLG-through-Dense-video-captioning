 today we are making Chinese hot and sour soup with chicken the beauty of making this yourself is that you can control how hot or house our it is and how thick it is by the ingredients that you add so the first thing you want to do is reconstitute some black fungus mushrooms and this is what they look like when they're dry and I probably have about 2 tablespoons it's just like a little handful here and I'm going to pour some boiling water over them just to cover them and our next step is to shred up the chicken and I just want to show you how I do it I have two chicken breast halves boneless here and I push down with my hand and then I push the knife through gently about a third of the way down and you get a thin slice like that and I'm going to do that again halfway down and I should get three nice thin slices and I feel you know want to cut them thinner you can do another slice it depends on the size of your chicken breast and now the grain is going this way so I'm just going to cut off little shreds like this and you can do this as thick or as thin as you like I like thin shreds if you wanted to do a larger piece you could do this and you get really nice thin pieces of chicken I just want to show you again I'm holding my blade at about a 45 degree angle and I'm pushing it away from me that helps me get a thin slice you could do this with fork too I prefer it with the chicken but if you want to do the poor if you could do the same thing now I'm going to finish shredding this up you need a sharp knife and then when you're putting your knife through the breast to this way just be very careful not to slice your hand you'll kind of feel where the knife is where the chicken isn't for your hand is I hold and you also want a sharp knife that hose so I'm going to put this in the bowl here and i have three tablespoons of soy sauce now going to mix this in and see if it's enough to cover it and if you have more chicken if you have larger chicken breasts you might want a little bit more soy sauce but it looks like it's covering it here so we're good and now I'm going to sprinkle and even an equal amount of phila cornstarch i have three tablespoons of cornstarch and i'm just going to mix that in with my hand and I'm going to drizzle a little bit of toasted sesame oil on here as well it's probably a teaspoon okay our chickens ready so I'm going to let it marinate while I chop up the rest of the ingredients so I've drained my mushrooms and their nights and reconstituted now and i'm just going to take a few and I stack them up one on top of the other and you just cut them into little strips as soon as you can get them or if you want them thicker you can cut them thicker but I like to cut them into little strips like that and I'm going to do it with the rest of them I have a 12-ounce block of extra firm tofu here you can use a softer tofu if you prefer and i don't think i'm going to use the whole thing i'm just going to start chopping and i'll see you when to stop it's up to you how much tofu you like I'm going to cut half of it first so I cut it into these slices here I'll stack them up and then I'm just going to chop down and I'm going to get these little strips I think I'll do it mmm now I'll leave them like this I don't want them to fall apart I have an 8 ounce can of sliced bamboo shoots that I've drained and I'm going to slice them into little strips like this I'm going to do it for all of them i'm going to use up the whole can because i don't really have a use for the bamboo shoots other than in this recipe but if you want to use less it to you you can use less so I brought up about eight or nine cups of chicken stock to a boil and I'm going to add the chicken the mushrooms the bamboo shoots and the tofu and I'm going to cook them for a few minutes until the chicken is cooked through so the chickens cook through it doesn't take long because it's shredded very thin I'm going to add a quarter cup of soy sauce I'm using low-sodium you can use full sodium and I have a quarter cup of rice vinegar I have two teaspoons of salt and three teaspoons of sugar but you want to taste your stock see how salty it is and how small do you want it you might not want to add any salt because the sodium from the soy sauce is probably funny for most people and now I'm going to add some white pepper and I'm going to do that to taste it's very hot so just be careful but you know you can just add a little bit taste and see if it's hot enough for you and then I'll show you the next step so I added about a teaspoon of white pepper to mine it's pretty spicy so you really just have to taste it and see how much is enough for you just go slow and now I have two tablespoons of cornstarch that I diluted in a half a cup of cold water and I'm going to have this to the soup and it should thicken it up if it's not thick enough for you you can add a little bit more corn starch I'm going to let it cook for a while and I'll check if it's thick enough for me so I ended up adding another tablespoon of cornstarch that I diluted with a tiny bit of cold water it thickens it it makes it almost that gelatinous consistency that you're used to getting at the chinese restaurants but i don't like it to goopy and it also depends on how much corn starch you ended up putting on your chicken how thick your soup is going to get and now i'm going to add some beaten eggs which will also thicken it a little bit so i have two eggs that I gently beat with a fork and i'll show you how to add them in second now i skimmed a little bit of the foam off of the top of the soup and i'm going to reduce the flame a little bit but I want it boiling that card slow it down okay and I'm just going to gently add the egg and as I do it slowly I just gently stir open i'm using a fork you can use chopsticks or whatever you want you just want to gently stir it and you'll get these little ribbons of egg you don't want to do it too vigorously because then you'll just incorporate the egg completely into the soup so just do it slowly and slowly stir and you get these it drops and now I'm going to maybe let it stand for I don't know 20 seconds just 2 legs cook through now maybe even less i think i might turn it off in a few seconds and when i do that i'm going to drizzle some toasted sesame oil until it to taste depends how much you like sesame oil bit i think it makes it super Lee good so I'm going to put in some sesame oil and i'll show you the next step okay so i've turned it off and I'd result about 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and now I'm just going to add a whole bunch of scallions that I chopped up and I saved a little bit for garnishing the bowl when I serve it I'm going to stir it in and it's ready to serve so here is our finished product our hot and sour soup with chicken I hope you enjoy
