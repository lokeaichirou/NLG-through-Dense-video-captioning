 call me Johnny Martha affectional down in New York hello everybody and welcome to my channel my name is Kayla and this channel is going to be about Japanese cooking and I'm gonna be throwing in some cultural and language lessons as well so this is my first video so I hope you enjoy and yeah let's get started hello hello everybody welcome to my first episode I am going to be showing you how to make it on today and this is a very very simple way of thinking it on it's not I'm not gonna be showing how to make the noodles or how to make the broth or that sheet and deafening it's just very quick and you can probably make this in about mmm like 10-15 minutes if you push it if you're on a rush so yeah I usually have this for lunch if I don't really feel like cooking if I don't want to get into the whole I don't know complex cooking method and most importantly this tastes delicious it tastes authentic and it's really easy to double triple or make as many as you want so if you have a group over if you're cooking for your partner it's quite easy to double up there's also lots of ways to tweak it I've shown how to add all the little accessories and all the little decorations and toppings but it's totally up to you if you want to not use green onion or not use fish cake which is coming before and Japanese which I'll show you anything like that so it's completely customizable which is really great and easy and delicious so yeah I hope you enjoy okay so here are the ingredients you'll need to leave one packet of fish along and I use Hokkaido divinington noodle some broth and please look in the description for an explanation of what products you use you need 1 green onion 1 egg Sami katenka food which is pickled radish and some cocoa which is Seema fish cake so first you're going to want to boil the water and while the water is coming to a boil chop the green onion and so I chopped these kind of thick here but you're probably going to want to slice them a little bit thinner than what I have because you're gonna want to slice the commonweal or the fish cake and don't like this too thick they taste a lot better when you slice them thinly and then nicely they took ground which you want to slice about the same thickness or maybe a little bit thicker than the kamaboko or the fish cake and once the waters come to a boil add the noodles without breaking them apart once you add them to the pot then set your timer for however long the noodles say to take on the package and add 1/8 and so now we're gonna make the broth and there's my little matryoshka measuring cup and for my broth I use a quarter cup of the actual broth and I water it down with some water so what I'm doing is just bringing it into the quarter cup and then pray into my mug which measures out to two cups which is how much broth you're gonna generally want per dish and then pouring in the boiling water that I've already boiled so that when the noodles are ready I could just pour it on straight away and it'll be hot and just set up my table I've put it on my little pig comes - now you want to take the noodles and the egg out of the pot I couldn't film this because I don't have a tripod that's high enough but yeah so right now without putting the broth in you want to put all the little decorations that egg the chemical everything on top of the noodles which are in the finished fold that you want to serve it in without putting the broth on you put the broth on last so when you're decorating it they don't kind of float away as soon as you put them down on the noodles everything stays in place you can put everything where you like without having it kind of float away and not look it's pretty neat x1 usually goes on the side you can add it to the egg you see on the side also now we're just adding the broth and I didn't add all of it because that was enough for me but it's totally up to you and yep there you go there's your finished product hi everybody so I hope you enjoyed watching my first tutorial please let me know in the comments below if you liked it or what I should change it was my first time doing this and I was kind of holding a camera with my hand as I was filming so I'm sorry if it was a little bit shaky also one more tip before I leave you guys this here has caused me so much confusion when I was first better not kind of getting into Japanese duration cuisine because I didn't really know how to use the spoon I thought that I don't know you just use it to like drink the broth like you do in Western cuisine but actually what you do and by the way this is called the TD dengue and Japanese I'll have you written some the screen Chiti dingus and what you do is you pick up the noodles Bachelor to eat in the noodles so I can't really do this but what you do is you pick up the noodles with your chopsticks and since they're hot while they're cooling in order to let them cool faster which I believe you set them while still holding them with your chopsticks you set like this little base like the end of the noodle in the little area of the spoon so it's cool so it's not sitting in the hot broth so it makes it easier to eat so usually when you're eating you have the chopsticks in your dominant hand which is my right and I have the cheating game or you can just call so-called like I think spoon and spoon and Japanese so you hold it in your left hand and you just kind of flip the noodles like this it's like also another fact about Japanese culture it isn't considered rude when you are slurping your soup actually your noodles I think this was only appropriate when you're eating traditional Japanese foods like them in auradon or soba not like spaghetti or things like that but when I was in Japan the first time I knew this going over there that slurping the noodles is a sign that you're enjoying the food that you think it takes good never something like that and I tried so many times to practice before I went over trying to flirt but it was really hard for me to kind of learn how to inhale when I was sucking noodles I guess that's what you do when you suck your noodles anyway but it was just so so hard for me to like inhale and actually make it sound so the first time I was out eating I think it was on man with my host family I was sitting there eating them and I knew I was doing it wrong I was just like whole thing that they wouldn't say anything and they did and they're like okay that you think it doesn't taste good umm so that's when I kind of learned that you kind of have to do it in Japan so I tried really hard and now I just don't even think about it and I just end up doing it when I'm right you don't like that but yeah so if you see Japanese people eating noodles and they're making a slipper ignore its is not rude it's actually a compliment to the chef so yes just that little pack for you right um but yes this is the end of my video I hope you enjoyed it please subscribe I am going to be posting a little bento box recipe hopefully next week before Easter and me busting my butt but I hope I can get it up by then so I hope you guys enjoyed that and yeah I'm really excited for this channel I hope you are too and yes please give me any constructive criticism anything below I'm always looking forward to learn and make this channel the best it can be so thank you so much guys and have a great day
