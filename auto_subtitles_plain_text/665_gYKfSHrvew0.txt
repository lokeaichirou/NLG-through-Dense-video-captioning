 hi guys and welcome back today mike is gonna be taking over the cooking later he's gonna be cooking his world-famous chef inspired professional to your sous chef position right shepherd's pie my favorite of all chef is Pilate because it's full of flavor I think it's something we've perfected over the years because we tend to cook a lot yeah it's so much better than me chopping things it's not fair so I'm gonna put two cloves of garlic I just gonna crush them and then peel them when there's a chop away it's a small dice two pieces I need to do a drizzle of olive oil I'm just gonna break this up before I put it in so it doesn't burn I'm gonna season it before I put it in the pan with a bit of salt and pepper yeah can you not do this any quicker when I was sous-chef it was done not right now I'm gonna add the meat in so we're just gonna darken the meat and whilst that's browning can i drain the potato you can drain the potatoes so now this meats nice and browned I'm gonna get some red wine which if you've had a glass already you can just pull the remainder in you just stir that in and I'm just gonna let that reduce down catch all the flavors now can you match those how's that sound this is 500 grams and this phone is so I'd seen only about 50 grams surgeon professional so after the butter we add a bit of salt and pepper mash one and we have some kind of machine they can do this no we just have you he's also left the skin on potatoes I don't know if we said that it's a new potato so the skin is much better on them cuz they are fresh I don't tend to put milk in my mashed potato to go in a shepherd's pie you've got so much juice in the mince as it is but then it kind of takes away from it so you want the exact what yeah you want it to be quite firm this is where my special ingredients come in which kind of gets a big renegade which I'm not sure many Shepherd's pies have so first I get some chopped tomatoes but is the same as you put in a spaghetti bolognaise it kind of adds like a sort of rich flavor to it which I quite like this is where I need you sous chef it is time for you to get a bit of gravy granules yeah all gravy powder now very gently and gently okay don't gently add it she didn't howdy Jenny but I do things gently put men and then there's one other secret ingredient you know that is Madan bravely well once prank a lot once brick just scatter those in we just stir that in we're gonna drop the temperature down if you've got time to let it simmer it definitely will add the flavor I need my tasting spoon gotta make sure it's seasoned properly needs more pepper yeah acceptable I mean rustic now this is all mixed in together I'm going to add in the final ingredient which is supposed to be you can use any kind of like chopped vegetable root vegetables a lot peas in there there's a lot of pieces it's good healthy yeah so first things first we're gonna add the meat it's just a bit of the time to make sure you're not overdoing it you know what else is a good ingredient it is honestly Mike hates ketchup but I put it into a pie when I cook now we see if your mushroom tasted a lot to say I think you needed more butter but you know if we've got to be healthy with these things I'll have to go through the middle with it dollops and then work your way out so how does this suck this the middle bit not squish outside because he's a cunning technique which is a fork a follicle gonna gently prod finish push it we did more buses a bit right it's fine so I like it to be a bit rustic any bits sticking up it's kind of good because that means they get extra Brown and so a little bit sticking up higher get more yeah toasty sous chef oh do you like to grate it's really hard because it's really far away from people that's not my problem you're the sous chef sue up ready for the oven right knees hop so it gets the grill action yeah make sure you get up sit so how long have it for 20 minutes I would say in all of them it's probably gonna take about 15-20 minutes hopefully a little less if you've got a grill and probably only take five minutes right I think uh I mean you can hear the sound of their great you're so proud of yourself my dear I'm ready you know I would do to this thing but I do edit and ruin it cover it and ketchup might be fine if I do say so myself acceptable nice really good good well if you guys want to see more of these recipes that I'll be cooking and you might be allowed to cook every now and then couple then either click or subscribe to the channel or the link below I'm just gonna you the chef's pipe on so you guys
