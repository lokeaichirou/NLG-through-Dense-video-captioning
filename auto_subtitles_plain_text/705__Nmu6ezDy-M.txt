 hi I'm John Caleta I'm the executive chef and Managing Partner of Cortino distante was located on the corner of Court of Ontario and state here in Chicago Illinois I've got also got a pasta cookbook that's called 250 true Italian pasta dishes which hopefully you get the opportunity to experience and give me some feedback as to what we've prepared for you today we're going to make an authentic penne alla vodka and we're going to start off by using some extra-virgin olive oil some garlic cloves and we're just going to get the flavors into the olive oil we're gonna had some diced tomatoes some canned peeled tomatoes a little bit of cream and then we're gonna add the pen at the end and some basil and it's gonna be amazing come over with me to the stove okay we've added some oil now we're going to add some garlic I'm going to get that going we've got some boiling water we're going to add the penne that's about 3/4 of a pound and we're going to add about an ounce and a half of salt and we're gonna now we're getting all the flavors from the garlic into the olive oil and that's going to take us a moment out once we've got all of the flavors out of the garlic now we add diced tomatoes and a little bit of vodka now we're going to take a little bit of the pasta water and we're gonna let that simmer we're gonna check the pasta in just a moment to make sure that it's at the al dente stage it's got another two minutes to go okay and you know when it's firm that's when we want to remove it it's a little bit too hard right now and you can see all the flavors coming together here now we're gonna add a little bit of cream ever so gently okay we're gonna bring these okay now this was a dish that was happened to be created in Rome where the vodka came from nobody knows but we know this much it's a lot of fun to cook and it's certainly a lot of fun to eat also so now we're gonna get all these flavors working and this takes about a good 20 minutes but it's worth the time and the the wider the pan the faster the cooking so we want to make sure that we've got all these flavors working together and we'll lower the heat now we want to get it to a medium flame and we want to time the cooking of the pasta and the finishing of the sauce so once we can get that together we're ready for an incredible penne alla vodka we're going to add the al dente pendant here we go now you guys you can see the Penta have been cooked al dente there is enough sauce to coat the penne the flavors from the pendent from the vodka and the tomatoes have been transferred to the pasta and this is going to be roughly about a three ounce portion of pasta which I believe to be an adequate amount I'm going to add some Grandda Padano nicely graded in a couple of sprigs of torn basil and we have a very simple and delicious penne alla vodka thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring these great preparations to you I can be contacted for any feedback at WWE artino Chicago comm I'd love to hear from you again you
