 hey everyone so happy Monday today I have a cooking video for you guys and for those of you who are like Claire you've never done a food video before you are incorrect my friend I have this one over here which is an awesome guacamole with mango recipe and this one down here which is a butter cake recipe which was the first time I had ever done it but I think it turned out pretty well but for today's dish I'm doing something really quick and easy I actually posted a photo on Instagram and if you guys follow me on Instagram you can probably tell that I'm a bit of a food enthusiast I like to cook and bake at home sometimes and I don't think I'm that bad but I don't do it very often because I feel like I always make way too much but with this dish I feel like it's pretty easy to control how much you make and you're not wasting a ton of food this is kind of my take on a traditional Korean dish called bibimbap but before you guys say anything yes I'm Korean but no I was not raised in a Korean household so I don't know how to do the traditional style but I feel like this kind of incorporates all the flavors that I really like that I typically have to get in a restaurant now when I said that this was a cooking video I kind of use that term loosely just because the only cooking that you really have to do is the rice in this video I mean you can add anything that you want to you could add meat if you'd like but I didn't really do that I kind of just used all the stuff that I had at home and I don't have any meat currently just cook your rice this is the kind that I like to use right now it's a brown rice and you can use whatever rice you want you can use white rice you can use brown rice you can use gluten free you can use gluten whatever I am NOT a racist man I was so excited to say that joke anyway like I was saying go ahead and cook your rice according to the directions on the back whatever they may be and since I'm only making this really for myself I'm only going to do half a cup of the beet brown rice just because once cooked it makes about two servings which is perfect for me and the directions on my bag of rice say that you should go ahead and add either butter oil to the pan so I'm just going to add a little bit of sesame oil just to add a little bit of extra Asian flavor in there and then really all you have to do is make the sauce and the key to this sauce the main ingredient that you really can't substitute is the gochujang or I don't know if I was even saying that right but is Korean red pepper paste and this is just a very common Korean condiment try saying that five times fast but I see it a lot in Korean cuisine whether it's just on its own or if you mix other things into it to kind of enhance the flavor I like to add honey as a sweetener because on its own go to Thanh is kind of sweet but it's mostly salty and spicy and then I do add a tiny bit of soy sauce but that's totally optional and unnecessary because like I said it's already pretty salty on its own and just eyeball it or do it to taste because sometimes I make it with a little less honey or make it with little more sesame oil depending on how I'm feeling but it's totally up to you now at this point you can go ahead and cook any meat or vegetables or any other things that you want to add to it it's totally up to you it's really good with like ground beef or some sauteed vegetables even mushrooms I really like in this but for me I don't really have any of that stuff today so I'm just going to add green onion and kimchi cuz I do have kimchi in my fridge and then also I have an egg because why not throw a bird on it and make it even more breakfast like but that's pretty much it guys once your rice is cooked all you have to do is throw in your sauce mix it all together go ahead and put it into a bowl at this point this is where you could add any meats or vegetables like I said I only have kimchi and I'm going to put a fried egg on top and then I'm just going to garnish it with a little bit of green onion so that is my cream dipping Bop Clare version salted just kidding that's a totally different channel and you should check them out because they're way better cooking channel I hope that this expanded your taste buds a little bit and you'll try cooking more exotic foods at home and let me know what other dishes you might want to see in the comments section below I am vlogging this week because it is VidCon so I have some cool stuff happening and yes that is all I'm gonna say about it so I'm going to finish it here thank you guys for watching as always I hope you have a fantastic week and I will talk to you very soon bye you everyone so about a week ago actually that's a lie I don't often cook and bake at home how dare you don't get too excited guys this is just a really excellent bro I am NOT Korean I am Green actually me I get a little bit of a boner saying runny egg it sounds so awful
