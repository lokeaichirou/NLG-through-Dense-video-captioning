 hey guys so today I thought I'd show you how to make some raw sauerkraut it's super easy to do and you only really need one ingredient which is cabbage sauerkraut really good for your digestion I know a lot of people don't eat it because of the acidity but I don't have a problem eating this and my boyfriend loves it on sandwiches I love putting it on my salads I think so you can use this green cabbage or red cabbage in the past we've used the red but I want to try this at this time so I'll show you a couple of things that you do actually need other in this mason jar or some sort of glass jar like this the reason a mason jar works really well it was because you can use these lids and the reason that you want to use those lives is because you're gonna need either some cheesecloth or some sort of breathable fabric over top I'll show you how to do that near the end there and that's just what is actually gonna help the cabbage ferment itself here a little bit of sea salt not very much I think the salt just kind of helps soften the cabbage a little bit so for those watching your sodium intake that's what it's for if you think that you can massage your kale up with by all means do it you're gonna need a big bowl to massage your cabbage in before it goes into your container and the only only things you're gonna need is a knife to cut it up and some water so let's get started so this is half of the cabbage bowl is fairly large and most people see their house right here right now I'm just gonna add the salt and start massaging it in to try to break this down this does get smaller kind of like when you cook kale or spinach or any greens it just starts to break down mmm so I might need to do the other half but I might not so I'm just gonna start with this massage it and then I'll put it in to the mason jar and if I need more then I'll do the other half fact measurements very often when I'm cooking so you should start off with about a tablespoon no fault this is sea salt um I'd never used me Ayodhya salt I mean of that crap so I'm gonna sprinkle this in and I'm gonna start massaging a little bit the last few times we made this we're using a recipe that called for some beet juice and I think that that just helps speed up the fermenting process a little bit doing that today it's just an extra step I didn't cut my cabbage up very much for any pieces because the knife that I have it's extremely extremely dull but when they're a bit smaller it obviously helps quite a bit you'll know it's starting to break down when it's still a little more liquidy and this is about as labour you can see this it's starting to listen a little bit you smell like these cabbage same idea is if you're doing like a raw kale salad you have to use a little lemon juice or simply a pulp massage and break it down I've never used lemon in this recipe and I don't know how it would affect the flavor of the sauerkraut but I feel like that would also help break down the cabbage if you don't want to use salt so that could be maybe an experiment it's glistening now and it's starting to go a little translucent so you can keep massaging this for a bit if you wanted to but I'm just going to get it in the mason jar better lighting if you have amazing jar that has a wider mouth I'm going or you also might want something like this to push the sauerkraut up and down because as you see it's filling up quite quickly but there's a lot of space in there so as you can see I managed to fill up a jar so half of a large cabbage is more than enough I think probably could have sucked a little more into this one but it won't push it now the next step is you're going to pour water and you want to make sure that the water is above the cabbage line if you don't put enough water in this and this starts to ferment it will create mold on top and you're gonna have to throw out the entire thing so more water is better the last time my boyfriend tried to do this he didn't put enough and in his started to get kind of gross now as this ferments it will release its own water so over the next few days you're gonna want to just keep an eye on the water levels of your sauerkraut and if you notice then it starts to get too low you're just gonna add a little more water and if there's any sauerkraut on the side so this is just a little piece of cheesecloth but we don't have this you can probably use like any hose or something else it just needs to be able to breathe it's tight and you're gonna want to keep these on your counter for the next three days every day is kind of you a little check once they start to smell a little bit like vinegar you can put them in the fridge one thing that I forgot to mention it was that when you're putting the lids with the cheesecloth in here you need to also have something to push the cabbage down into the liquid otherwise it will rise up and that can also cause mold when it's starting to ferment so here I have a shot glass and I'm just using the strain from the cheesecloth to push it down and in here I'm using a spice well a little to push it down you can see it's coming on the top if you can find something that is gonna fit the entire mouth of the glass that's even better I don't have anything but these will do we kind of see let's push the cabbage down enough when the liquid is up here so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
