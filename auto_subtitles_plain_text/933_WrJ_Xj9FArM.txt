 hey guys and welcome back to the kitchen so today I'm here on my own like it's not here but I'm doing a very exciting recipe today a lot of you have been asking for traditional homemade fish and chips so we're gonna start off with the chips we're using Maris Piper potatoes today because apparently they go squishy in the middle and then fluffy and nice and crispy on the outside chips are probably one of my favorite things ever but I always feel guilty about eating chip shop chips because they are fried so today we are going to be baking them I always have couples with my fish and chips and now they're hard to find chip shops do not stock cockles anymore if Mike had his way I think we'd probably have fish and chips takeaway once a week however it's usually more like once every couple of months but if it works out well cooking at home you never know maybe we can start doing at home surf game take away so now we're gonna pop them in the oven for about 40 minutes to bake now time for the fish we are actually using coal each day instead of cod because it's more sustainable what we're gonna do first is make the batter and we're using lager so whilst the oils heating up I'm just going to sift in 225 grams of self-raising flour I hate beer but beer battered fish always tastes cats we're going to prepare the fish what we're gonna do first is pop a little bit of flour give it a bit of a dusting on both sides I think this just helps the batter to stick to the fish because otherwise it may be it's slimy I'm gonna put a little bit of salt pepper on so now it's on the fish we need to test that the oil is hot enough you must be very very careful with hot oil but you want to take a little bit of bread and you want to pop it into the oil and see how it reacts interment to fizzle away tada I want it to have a good coating of butter and then we're gonna pop it in oh wow and we're gonna fry it for two to three minutes on each side put the other one in as well never fried fish at home but it looks amazing I'm really excited by this Mike is gonna be so jealous he's missing this look at that golden brown it's difficult to know when the fish inside is gonna be hooked you can see that the batter's done because you want it to still be nice and succulent you don't want to be like a dry old boot and they'll take it out now and pop it on to some kitchen roll to soak up any excess oil they look amazing no fish and chips will be complete without mushy peas though so we're doing washing fees as well DIY style we've got Sainsbury's garden peas boil them away for a minute I'm gonna chop up a few leaves of mint and of course Mike is like the condiment both and heat the only thing he likes is mayonnaise I'm gonna go to my dog sauce you might catch up to my barbecue sauce just mayonnaise boring glad he's not here pop the mint in pop the creme fraiche in and we're gonna mush them together with a fork this is quite fun it's my popping bubble wrap mix it up put it in our little pot I've never made mushy peas before but if I do say so myself I think they look pretty great so I'm going to serve everything up on traditional British newspaper because that is the old-fashioned way so here they are they are looking pretty amazed balls I'm gonna pop on a little bit lemon okay I'm gonna pop a bit of ketchup on don't tell Mike he's not here what he doesn't know won't hurt him moment of truth that is so good almost like a real chip shop fish and chips nothing better than eating chips with your fingers dipped it in the mushy peas as well even though it's not fried I think they're pretty damn good chips I think we absolutely nailed this the batter is just crunchy enough but just soggy enough in the right places if you enjoyed our traditional British fish &amp; chips recipe then don't forget to check out our brilliant British scones here and Jack's restaurant style harissa sea bass recipe here Mike has all of us washing up to deal with when he gets home I love it he's missed the fun parts don't forget to subscribe if you want to see new videos every Wednesday and comment below if you want to see anything special if you have any requests for us and we'll try our best to make it for you see you next time
