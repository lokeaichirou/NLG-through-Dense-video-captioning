 here at the tannery cookery school I always emphasize how easy it is to cook good proper simple food I want to introduce a recipe that's a particular favor of mine its cottage pie but I wanted to cook it my way I have some lovely ingredients here I have the best of Irish mincemeat I have some lovely tomato ketchup I have some marinade me this is a beautiful beautiful marinade just because it says marinade it doesn't mean you have to use it as a marinade only use it as a seasoning for food so I'm just gonna chop an onion and put it into this pan also while I'm putting in as well are some bacon lardons I'm always telling people that he let somebody do the work for you if possible and this is a classic example of that is a beautifully caught smoked bacon lardons that i use what pasta i used with all sorts of things but in here unusually I'm adding these into the cottage pipe to give a lovely flavour to cook good food you gotta have good produce it's as simple as that and this beef it's a hundred percent Irish beef you can't get better than that the secret of mashed potatoes in my view is generosity I mean in fairness okay half the time I worry about my waistline or nearly all the time but butter and milk make beautiful mashed potatoes okay it's up to you how much butter you use if you're feeling naughty you've had a bad day at the office add a little bit extra so posh and Irish butter you can pieces the classic cottage pie of course has mash but I wanted to make a different type of mesh and I also love having an emphasis on Irish food and what's really Irish is our Paris I'm gonna make a parsnip mash top up with cheddar cheese and the depth of flavor that's in here because of all my lovely ingredients it'll make a really well dish you'd surprise people these persons are just gonna be put in with the potatoes and more them cook everything together boil them up and then mash them up now I'm gonna surprise you this stuff is really really brilliant I tasted it and I was looking for something to use it in and that's quite often what I do anything that you can use in your cooking that you keep in the cupboard I'm a huge fan of because it means life is way easier so all I'm going to do just put some of this into my mince now this ketchup is fantastic stuff it's smooth not too vinegary they've done taste tests with this ketchup and it is won all around us taste it and see it is really beautiful so some salt and pepper in here and we're nearly done oh mama I love mash so probably okay now to taste which is hugely important they're lovely little bit of water they're just smiling at me Bobby putting it together is really easy anybody can do it all I'm going to do is put mints into the bottom of the dish put the mash on top and then top it with beautiful mature Irish cheddar the color will be lovely simple as that into a nice hot oven for about 15-20 minutes and you're done I'm getting hungry there you have it my college pie with parsnip mash and lovely melted cheddar cheese
