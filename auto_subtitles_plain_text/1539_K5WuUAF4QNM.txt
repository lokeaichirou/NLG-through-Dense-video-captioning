 all right open to please word by number today we'll be doing a really quick recipe just some Vietnamese style crispy spring rolls so let's just jump right in all right so here's our filling we're going to be using pork today about a half pound but we're not going to really go and do measurements at all we're just going to give you the basic ingredients you can use them or substitute in some of your own so we're start out with some soy sauce actually it was fish sauce this is soy sauce soy sauce along with some assorted vegetables so we'll be using some carrots and that along with some minced shallots and add to that some shredded mushrooms you can use I hope you like these happen to be shitake I think then on some ah was that oh yeah minced scallions then we'll add some more seasoning lot some crushed red pepper either Thai dried chilies actually some ground black pepper a few two or three cloves of garlic minced and then we're add about a tablespoon or so or just enough corn starch to really just get it all to bind together and be smooth and we're going to stir that all up then to this we're going to add just a handful of one inch broken off pieces of vermicelli noodles have been soaking in warm water for like 10 minutes or so till they're soft all right now we are feeling I want to start wrapping our wrappers we're just using round rice paper wrappers and you just take them out of the package there's a big disc and have a plate of lukewarm water and just insert an end under the water and just rotate it until the whole thing is pretty pliable make sure you get the whole thing wet how nice and pliable just take it over until a dry plate and then we're take our pork filling just take a tablespoon put it into your hand make a log out of the pork and this place log at one ends this time we're doing a whole spring roll but you can also use a half and just have a thinner thinner wrapper to it so just put into a log fold that end over covering the log and fold the sides over themselves and roll that up into it like a little burrito and just place that on a plate do about three a time and then fry them in batches so I'm just gonna keep on rolling these up alright now we've got them all rolled up we're just going to fry them in batch to the four we've preheated our oil to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit and we're just going to plop them in there just take a pair of tongs just nicely drop each one in being careful they're not touching each other otherwise they might cook together throughout the cooking process we're just going to rotate them to make sure they get fried evenly on all sides just pick them up and flip them it's probably easiest way once you notice some brownie on both sides should take about five or six minutes they're done just remove them from the oil and then take them over just to a baking sheet with a cookie rack on it it's newspaper under it let the excess oil drip off after you're done frying each batch you can let them all cool off and then plate them on a plate full of green lettuce pieces and some fish dipping sauce to eat them just dip them in the sauce wrap them the piece of lettuce and enjoy so we'll see you next time I please order by number this whole recipe is available on our website at please order by number blog spot.com see you next time
