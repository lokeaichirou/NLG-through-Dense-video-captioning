 now there's every chance you've been sent here by loved one because you're a keen Baker but you haven't got the dough balls to back it up so this video is going to show you all the tips to making a classic white bloomer loaf and then we'll use in the perfect grilled cheese sandwich because let's face it everyone loves the smell of freshly baked bread but yours stinks Oh a grilled cheese sandwich it doesn't get much easier than that it's bread is cheese its butter pretty much it however you guys suggest that you make it a little bit more difficult for me and I learn how to make my own bridge so here we go homemade grilled cheese let's go so we're going to make a basic bread dough and once you've nailed this you can make so many different Bridge this is 500 grams of strong flour so high gluten content makes the bread really really soft spongy absolute perfect goes into our machine you can do it by hand but actually this takes all the fuss out of it good another thing that makes bread rise is yeast so we've got droid active yeast and we need to do pop that into a little bit of water just to begin to activate it that just room-temperature water yeah kind of body temperature it's like too hot it will kill the yeast too cold it just take longer and then season your bread we are going so based this is a wet glue yep so about a teaspoon of salt into there don't add it into the yeast because it has a tendency to store denature the yeast because of its a pH levels basically but to sciency all you need to know is keep the salt separate from the yeast nothing you've ever done is in between science right clamp it down switch it on and then pour in this you may not need all of it so go sort of 7/8 leave a little bit back bit more perfectly you can do this by hand but ideally in the machine it needs about 5 minutes of kneading until it's soft and elastic it's doing by hand it might ten minutes just the way you work it okay okay at this point it hasn't quite all come back together so dribble a little bit more liquid in you can't take out so it's best to hold them back and had it more if you need it every flower behaves slightly differently speed it up get some elbow grease in there there we go just which it off lifts up and this is the kind of elastic though we want it just slide off the dough hook if you pick it up a little bit of flour if you find too sticky is a little bit sticky just so you can handle it I wouldn't have a feel of this because I want to okay so is that sort of like elastic II stretchy dough and when you're working with clothes back on itself yes and that's the gluten in there when you're working with dough don't touch any part wait too long like hot potato keep it moving and then it never sticks your hand so what you need to do is just kind of fold in on itself so you're just tucking the inside in doing the way you're just rolling and tucking to get a nice man then take the bowl off without the hook mushroom and then once you've got a nice round smooth bit of dough place it into your bowl cover it with a tea towel and that just keeps the dust and insects out allows the air and the yeast inside to breathe and leave it in a warm place like room temperature basically for about an hour to an hour and a half and what will happen is this like this expands so you really didn't see it there it's really ballooned up and that's the common Doc's that that comes out of the yeast at this point we knock it back so literally just put it away from the edge and not all that air out but what you've done is add so much flavor and lightness into that mixture bring it all together again into a ball and this time again you want to tuck the outside back into the middle and then make it kind of low shape we're going to make a classic bloomer drop it into there smooth side up beautiful look at that and that is your bread now it's important to leave it covered under teat out for another hour and Cara and that will allow it to double in size and it kind of balloons up so it'll be right up here yep at that point you can cut some slashes across it and place it into another now the key to baking an awesome boom and getting the best possible spot of bread the crispy beer for crust so get yourself a tray of water in a hot oven 220 degrees Celsius and a tray of water in the bottom place it into the oven at 220 cook 15 minutes then without opening the oven just turn it down to 180 and cook it for another 25 and it's 40 minutes in total 15 minutes at high temperature 25 at a low temperature and the pan of water in the bottom kind of help steam and create an amazing crust and then we can use it to make the best grilled cheese sandwich ever white Blue Mermaid and remember once you've nailed this bread recipe you can do so many different things with it you can add so many different flavors make it your own shake your buns rolled plats we've gone for the classic I'm going to slice to doorstep sized slices out of this good sort to centimetres thick and you only get the cheese ready to cheese's you guys said mixture cheese is good so cheddar and Gruyere you grate those up we have geez awesome now remember that pan of water we head in the oven that's what gives you that amazing crust on the bread try that I'm not sure much Beach fresh bread bread is the death of me seriously I literally sometimes sit in on a Saturday night whole Tiger like icon wow that's a good night in now for the inside of the sandwich open out like a book and on the inside I want you spread some mustard for this is English mustard it's quite fiery just a little scratching but it really helps with the cheese plus when it melts and goes all gooey you get that little line of yellow mustard kind of oozing in there girl the Gruyere is really stringy the cheddar is full of flavor so we're going to pile that on top of one side of here and then a couple other flavors that you guys suggested a pinch or Agana inside like so and black pepper beautiful lid back on and then the key to grilling the awesome grilled cheese sandwich it's pan right so not actually going to grill it there's a severe lack of grill yeah yes and however the important thing is not to pan fry it in oil or butter but to butter the bread so softened butter with a pastry brush to recap muscles on the inside but on the outside then into the pan butter side down there we go and then you've got a whole nother side that also needs buttering the key here dry nonstick pan not too hot you don't want that bread to burn before the cheese in the middle has time to do so a medium heat and you want to give it about three four minutes to go beautifully crispy and golden on one side then we can turn it over after a couple of minutes we can turn this what you're looking for is that oh hi yes golden crispy and for the last minute just pop a little and what that will do is trap in all the steam and heat make sure the cheese is super easy in the middle but it will still be crispy because your on the side here we go and it might sound like a lot of effort but this is the best version of the simplest comfort through never listen to this crunch as we cut into it and look at that cheesy goo on the middle you can see the mustard in there serve it with a chutney of choice just a little bit of tartness but that is an incredible real cheese edge sorted get the chalks around that and tell me is that one of the best cheese sandwiches you've ever tried or why we'll try it I'm gonna put this in my happy place oh that is incredible little flecks of flavor so good now if you guys know anyone friends or family who consider themselves kind of master bakers that haven't cracked the perfect loaf and please do share this video with them so they can
