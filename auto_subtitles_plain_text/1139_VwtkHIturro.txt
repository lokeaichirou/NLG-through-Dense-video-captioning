 hi my name is Andrew Kelly and today I'm gonna be cooking a dish called colcannon it's a dish using Albert Bartlett rooster potatoes some savoy cabbage some spring onions some butter and a little bit milk so what I'm going to do is I'm going to peel the potatoes and boil them I have some boil and behind me next thing I'm going to do is take savoy cabbage I'm going to cut the cabbage in half then into quarters any outside leaves I'm going to remove and then I'm going to remove the core from the cabbage so first thing I'm going to do is just slice the cabbage as fine as I can okay so that's the cabbage sliced so what I'm going to do now is just put that into bought a pot of boiling salted water and cook that roughly two or three minutes till the cabbage is just tender okay so where the cabbage is cooking there I'm just going to mash these potatoes the potatoes at this point don't need to be perfectly smooth I actually prefer them if they have a little bit of texture to them as well it's not so cooked in green cabbage I'm just going to put the cabbage in there generally about half the quantity of cabbage to potatoes so one kilo of potatoes 500 grams of cooked cabbage so we just took the cabbage so it's tender just taste a little bit I'm gonna tell you just thought well a little bait in it not too soft so that's a hot potato and cabbage there so what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to finish it with the spring onions and the milk I'm just going to pour the milk into there so I'm then going to put the spring onions into the milk so the time that comes to the boil that's ready to go okay so that's the potato and cabbage mixed together okay so that's the spring onions in the milk brought to the boil so I'm just going to pour that in a bit at a time so really what we're looking for here is I can a nice fluffy mashed potato with a subtle flavour of onion just coming through from the cabbage and what I find if you're making this in any quantity at all whatever we do is put it into an electric mixer with the paddle attachment but the paddle attachment go around slowly just pour your milk in so what we're looking for here is it's like an a nice fluffy texture what we don't want is a wet potato purely so I think we're almost there now with this so I'm just going to tip it into a serving bowl so the potato needs to be nice and hot so you can see it's a nice fluffy mashed potato and to finish that off I'm just going to put a nice healthy knob of butter in the middle just to melt over the potatoes so there we have a hot steaming bowl of cold cannon so that's mashed potato sliced cabbage some spring onions and a nice norm of fresh butter on the top you
