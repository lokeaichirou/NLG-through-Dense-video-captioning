 me so it's just fermented soybeans it's considered a medicinal food in some parts of the world and is a daily staple and the traditional Japanese diet miso is available in a range of colors from white all the way to dark red white miso is are typically very mellow and sometimes sweet and flavor while a red miso is much richer and hearty ER and tastes the longer the miso has been fermented the darker and color it will be so dark red miso is are considered to be more nutrient rich than the lighter counterparts you can use either dark miso or light miso in this recipe the ingredients in a traditional miso soup are 5 cups of water or vegetable broth half a pound of firm tofu cut into half inch cubes one ounce of dried shiitake mushrooms four tablespoons of light or dark miso and a sheet of nori we're also going to use 2 cups of broccoli one cup of carrots that will julienne and three to four teaspoons of ginger that will grate nori is a sea vegetable that's usually found in cheap form like this it's a dense source of nutrients such as calcium vitamin A vitamin C iron and iodine I would encourage you to experiment with all the different types of sea vegetables like wakame kombu high g key and arame miso might just be the perfect food it contains all essential amino acids and is a great source of phosphorus potassium protein B vitamins iron and calcium it's also rich in the anti-cancer agent genestein studies show that daily consumption of miso leads to lower rates of cancer lower cholesterol and lower blood pressure we'll use a 3 quart saucepan a slotted spoon a small bowl a fork I'll cut the vegetables on a salad master machine or you can use a knife and cutting board bring the water or vegetable broth to a boil remove it from heat and add the shiitake mushrooms cover and let sit for about 20 minutes cut the carrots and grate the ginger we recommend not peeling your carrots just wash them well because most of the nutrients are very close to the skin ginger root is a great anti-inflammatory it also aids in digestion and can alleviate nausea tear the nori into 1-inch pieces you can fold it if that helps using your slotted spoon remove the mushrooms from the broth cut off the stems and discard them then thinly slice the caps I like the stem so I'm just gonna leave them in at the tofu nori and ginger to the veggie broth and return to a simmer and cook for about 3 minutes add the broccoli mushrooms and carrots to the broth cover and simmer for another minute just until the broccoli turns bright green remove one cup of the broth and add it to the small bowl gently stir in the miso with a fork until it's dissolved it's important that your broth is not boiling when you add the miso because this could destroy the delicate cancer-fighting compounds found in the miso stir the dissolved miso into the soup the shiitake mushrooms in this soup are a great source of vitamin D the vitamin D is shown to be very protective against prostate cancer you can have this soup any time of day but I prefer to have it for breakfast you
