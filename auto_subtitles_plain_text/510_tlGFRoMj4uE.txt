 now it's time for a little lesson Susan shady is a cooking instructor and she and her husband used to own the polonaise restaurant in South Utica now she teaches people how to cook hi I'm Susan Sadie and I operate Susan's cooking school how do you on my head thrown back because she says if I do it like this is how you look like food this is Darius's Susan's husband and he'll be assisting as we make tomato and cheese pierogi one popular item that was on our menu so the first thing we're gonna do is make the filling and I like to use onions cooked in butter because what's better than onions cooked in butter so we'll melt this butter which is looks like a lot but it's a lot of filling that we're making and then we'll add these onions and we'll cook them just until they're tender but not browned so that they're soft enough and but you don't see the little dark specks of onion in the filling so our butter is ready just add our onions so with a butter ready to go the onions added in they will be sauteed just until they are soft and while Darrius magically handles the sauteing of the onions will head over for the making of the filling and the dough with Susan okay so here is our ingredients for our pierogi dough I have my flour in here we're just using all-purpose flour all-purpose unbleached flour and I'm going to add my salt and what I like to do is mix my eggs with the water ahead of time so it makes it much easier to make the dough so now I'm going to just stir this in and what I'm doing is incorporating all of my moistening all my flowers so that when I go to knead it it's it's much easier to knead that salt in there now if when I'm making this and this takes just experience to know if the dough feels too wet I can add a little bit more flour if it feels too dry I can add a little bit more water but don't add too much you don't want a wet dough right you know usually this amount works pretty good but if you're making in the summer when it's humid it might be too wet you might need to add a little more okay yeah usually I mean usually in my pasta there's more eggs to water than in this this a little more water than eggs but yeah it's very it is a pasta really it's a pasta so now that's ready to need I don't need it very long for it's not like when I make breads so this is I just like to knead it for about a minute put just a little flour just to prevent it from sticking and when you're kneading dough just kind of roll with the palm of your hand and fold over and I always tell my students like when we're making breads and stuff especially women whose arms and hands might not be as strong to use your shoulders you know to get but right behind it so I just want to make it smooth all right if you make your own pierogi and eat them you'll lose weight because this is a workout it's best to let this rest for about ten or fifteen minutes so that the gluten and the flour can relax and be able to roll out the dough without it bouncing back and okay it's stretching so I just cover it with a little flour I don't want to mix this flour in but just to prevent it from sticking next up time to make the filling okay our onions are already there they're tender but you know not browned although it's not a crime if you do brown the relevants not going to hurt anything so we'll take these over to put to our potatoes and add them directly to our potatoes potatoes are mashed with a ricer so that everything is completely imagine no lumps and now we can add the rest of our ingredients I have our salt and pepper here and Bill you won't having that cheese please Brad and this is about a cup of ricotta cheese ready and that's all there is to our filling I will just mix this up so as Susan mixes up the filling her husband Darius gives us a little lesson on the polish language and pierogi he says we're mixed up PA doggy not P a dog is a very plural it's already plural so once again we as Americans American eyes so if you're having pierogies for dinner you're gonna I'm gonna have a pair of yes so you learn something new every day so we'll take a hunk of our dough here and first I like to just spread it out with the heel of my hand I'm just you want to make sure that your dough is not sticking to your counter you don't want to use excessive flour but you want to make sure that you you're not gluing it to your table then it causes problems I'm just gonna roll it to an even thickness in you know the thickness is can vary if you like a lot of dough you can roll yours a little thicker but I would say I probably roll it to about an eighth of an inch okay just keep lifting it and make sure it's not sticking so you roll your dough out until it's nice and thin and then you grab your Hiroki tool from quick cut and mohawk and you cut out your circles plant your cutter quick twist and a little flick helps to separate it and then pick up your scraps because these can be used to make more POV and we're going to use them to make our dessert today also okay I'm going to take my scooper let's see it's nice and cold and the butter in there gets firm too in it and see how it's holding its shape which really helps when you go to fill these so each disc gets a scoop of the filling and then it's time for a little bit of finesse alright so take put a little flour in your fingertips there give them so they won't stick that's alright don't worry about it that's okay and are you right-handed I hope I can do it together okay so put let these sit on your right hand then take your index finger of the other hand and your thumb and kind of put this finger down to just hold it and then just kind of or two and just stretch it over the top first yeah and try not to squish it like that yeah that's all right and then gently push a little bit to the side and then do one side that's it and then do the other side a little bit yeah so that you have don't wanto and then you can actually stretch the dough over a little bit so that that way you don't have the filling in the way okay now so you don't want a fish-shaped Carosi so now you can know you can you can kind of plump it up and then squeeze it up so that you know you can kind of shape it a little more and after you're done okay you ready try another one I am alright here no there that's good another thing you can do is if you're so dozle sticky you can actually slide the bottom on a little flour to it and then it'll help and you might have your own method you know mine works for me but you know whatever works but basically you want to seal the top first and if you can actually stretch the stovetops hmm and then then do the sides and anyway it helps keep your shape also that's it and then the reason again that you don't want the filling stuck in betweens they'll open up in the water and you have a mess so after you're all said and done it's time to boil when they come to the top and they float they're basically done then they go to the frying pan along with onions and butter and there you have it a little sour cream with it as well understand yeah or a lot of sour cream that is awesome is so good and it's so different than but I love promise Hiroki I thought so I'll show you see there you go PA ragi not pure doggies it's very plural so there you have it delicious authentic homemade pierogi not pirozhkis PA ragi not pierre-auguste is very plural you
