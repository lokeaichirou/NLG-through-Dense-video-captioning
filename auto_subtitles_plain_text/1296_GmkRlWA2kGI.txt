 [Music] hi guys and this is my new kitchen so I'm really excited here and welcome to my youtube channel and today I'm making a very yummy dish it's called beef goulash and it's an Eastern European dish but originally comes from Hungary and I'll show you a very easy way to make it and I hope you press all your family friends partners and so on so we're going to be needing 400 grams of beef cut into slices and I've got here 2 tablespoons of flour 1 teaspoon of paprika 1 tablespoon of tomato puree half a pepper you can use red or green I've got 2 bay leaves 1 onion 2 cloves of garlic and then here we've got about 300 meters of beef stock and 200 grams of canned tomatoes which is about half a can I'm using 100 millilitres of red wine you can get any cheap one salt pepper creme fraiche or sour cream and two carrots and about 400 grams of baby or new potatoes ok first of all we're gonna Brown our beef self prepared my pan heat it up now it's very hot and we're gonna Brown the beef until it's very very dark and color and then take it off the pan once you go follow on all sides just take it out the steak is cooked from both sides and don't leave it to overcook because it's going to become really chewy and we want me to be very soft just take it out into a plate and put it aside [Music] mmm this smells so good the whole house smells like absolutely amazing you can see it's been simmering for about one and a half hours it became like a solid liquid source now we're gonna do we're gonna add our potatoes and let it cook for another half an hour and then it's ready to go just mix those in I'm really hungry comment to try this and before you put salt and pepper taste a little bit see how much you need because usually all the flavors from the vegetables and the means and obviously the red wine sauce it's very very salty already from natural sugar so just add a little bit try it and let it simmer for more it's all done up look at this oh my god it's amazing I'm really hungry one of trying to give it's a bit hard to hold this plate back it's hot it's really hot and oh my god mm-hmm this is amazing guys try this recipe it's absolutely delicious hope you enjoyed this video please like and share and teach soon bye [Music] yes
