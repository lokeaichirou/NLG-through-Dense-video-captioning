 hey dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah cooking I'm gonna show you how to make baked turkey meatballs these are like the trifecta of perfectness they are delicious they are fast and they're healthy so let's get started and then we'll be done in a flash and you'll get to make them all right I've got a pound of lean ground turkey here so this is turkey breasts make sure if you want to keep these low fat or whatever to get turkey breasts because sometimes it'll be like dark turkey meat and then that often has just as much fat as beef would so anyway whatever okay this is some oatmeal and I'm just sort of crumbling it up with my hands you can use bread crumbs or matzo meal crumbs or anything like that just something kind of dry that's gonna like absorb the moisture from the egg the egg moisture and some parsley and garlic and these are like these are pretty garlicky the turkey is so mild that garlic really sticks sticks out and then also because we're baking these instead of frying them the garlic stays a little sharper which I really like especially with sort of Italian food you can like use these mixed in after their bank mixed in with some warm tomato sauce and serve it over spaghetti but one of my very favorite things to do with these is while they're still warm wrap them up in some napa cabbage leaves or some big lettuce leaves with like like it's a heaney sauce and some radishes and cucumbers and stuff like that and almost almost make like a I don't know like a it's healthy it's a wrap that's a wrap you know what I mean anyway you can do lots with them and they're even good cold the next day so it's one of them become like one of my go-to recipes now then I've got some grated carrot and I graded this on a microplane so it's like super finely grated I've also done this recipe using grated sweet potato I like the fine greater just because it gives the finished meatballs a more delicate texture but you could probably use the regular cheese grater probably probably I've never tried it salt and sometimes I'll also add a couple tablespoons of Parmesan cheese to the same mixture if I'm doing like a Italian style mixer Rooney and pepper look guys I finally got a pepper grinder so I don't have to like grind it by hand like the Paleolithic era or something there she proud of me okay okay so once this is mixed up well I've got a baking sheet here that I've just lined with some parchment paper and I'm gonna use my little cookie scoop just to portion it out you could roll it by hand but this is way faster and like really in the grand scheme of things who wants to spend time making sure that their meatballs are perfectly round I don't you might need to like really put them close together depending on how big your cookie sheet is because you'll get probably 24 meatballs out of this mixture okay awesome that last one is a little shrimpy but I'm just gonna put these in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes until they are nice and firm and they'll be a little bit golden brown okay so 20 minutes later it's given me just enough time to cook some spaghetti and heat up some just plain tomato sauce marinara sauce so they're done they're set so I can go ahead and plop them on my bowl here so simple and so delicious so if you like this recipe please check out my healthy foods playlist up there it's got a lot more other like high protein low fat low carb kind of kind of recipes and please don't forget to subscribe because that way you'll get notified whenever I release a new yeah and also principle recipes are always available at hilahcooking.com so come over there and say hi to me over there tio would be fine there's a winner all right thanks for watching and I'll see you guys later
