 hi cuckoo birds I'm Alex the French guy cooking and today we're making a note I'm French classic the Mormon air has known as mussels in Marinette sauce fresh seafood in a battery white wine and shallots sauce so it's tasty it's cheap it's easy and it's a French dish you can make in under 10 minutes come on guys let's do it first up grab a few shallots and mince them roughly - 2 cloves of garlic pick up a small bunch of parsley and a stalk of celery for both separate the leaves from the stalks we use the fine and tender leaves in the dish but fiber Stokes will pimp and pump up the flavors of a bunch of dried herbs so I guess that's it for the Museum + ms on bass yeah middle class is just a fancy French word for preparation but you know it's always good to insert a fancy French word into a cooking conversation so I was too shaped by the chef's needle at the cafe but it felt like deja vu maybe that's too much now we need some mussels and I reckon this seafood is quite amazing it's cheap delicious versatile and on top of that it's sustainable use about a kilo of mussels for two people start by rinsing them and are running cold water give them a good scrub and remove any dirt barnacles of fiber stuff very important discard the broken ones and also the ones who would not close when lightly squeezed in a large casserole pan over medium heat and a good knob of butter I mean a serious one infusing the bunch of dried herbs in the seasoning butter will ensure a better distribution of the aromas at the end drop in the shallots and the garlic and cook them till they get soft after a few minutes pour in a good amount of fresh and acidic white wine like new scatter or Sauvignon or whatever one you like seasoned well with so pepper and let the wine evaporate a bit so the amount of wine in this recipe is totally up to you I am using half a bottle of it because I like it and also because I want to spare some glasses for the meal afterwards you can use beer instead or you can use apple cider as well or if you don't want to use alcohol you can use a pint of veg stock and a drizzle of vinegar and still the dish will be amazing I'm telling you French cooking is not cast in stone what's important is that you own place the muscles in along with the celery leaves cook them cover for about 5 minutes stirring once or twice when they open nicely they are ready to go just discard the closed one it might not be exactly in the classic Musclemania recipe but I like to add a dash of double cream in mind you know just to make it a bit more no tea and also because I own it sprinkle that with parsley and stir well combine all those lovely ingredients together the flavors are intense and perfectly balanced butter mussels and shallots bring a deep richness yet the white wine and the herbs bring a much-appreciated freshness serve them as they are always french fries on the side so guys that's it I told you this recipe is nothing difficult and considering the amazing result at the end you should definitely give it a try so like comment share it on your social media and subscribe to foodtube back to my own channel as well for many more delicious recipes but I tell you what you need more ok I made a friendship a spy with an American twist crispy creamy and with bold flavors it is easy to make contingent check out the video right now on my channel messy
