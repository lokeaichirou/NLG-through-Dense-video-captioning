 hello everyone welcome back to cook and share today we're making shrimp tempura and this is requested by Johanna lien from the Philippines so let's begin with our ingredients first we have a baking soda all-purpose flour shrimp that we'd be shelled and deveined and we cut a little crisscross shape in the bottom cooking oil ice water for the sauce we have lemon juice sesame oil and soy sauce the first step is to mix the dry ingredients so we've added our all-purpose flour to a bowl now we're going to add our baking soda to the flour and we'll give this a mix or a stir next we'll crack the egg and whisk it well now we'll add the ice water and whisk again until it's well combined now we'll combine the dry in the wet ingredients by adding the flour to the egg mixture and we'll whisk it until it's combined but don't over mix it until it looks just about like this there are a few lumps but that's okay and the next step is to take the shrimp and make sure the shrimp is good and drive so we've just patted this off with a paper towel and we're going to dredge it in the flour so it's nicely coated and we're going to put it the egg mixture and again making sure it's nicely coated and directly from the egg mixture into the oil and well this is he crying in the oils and we've used olive oil to use any kind of its oil you want to just continuously cold deep scrimp with the 8mr so you get a nice thick batter and one-third fruit that's a nice golden brown just remove from the oil and set it aside now we're going to make our personal sauce by adding the soy sauce lemon juice and sesame oil and we'll give this a stir and you're ready to serve and this is our delicious shrimp tempura you're going to love this for exact measurements on this recipe visit our website at wwlp.com and as always have a great day and enjoy
