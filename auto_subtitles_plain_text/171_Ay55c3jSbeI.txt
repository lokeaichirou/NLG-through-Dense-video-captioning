 hi this is Durrani with foods 101 and today we're making chicken kebab I've got 1 pound of chicken now these are just chicken tenders that I cleaned I patted dry and I put here in a dish that we're going to use to marinate these chicken tenders in I've got a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil here 1/4 of a cup of soy sauce I have 1 tablespoon of fresh minced garlic I have 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar I've got peppercorns right here in the bottom as you can see those little peppercorns it's going to give the chicken a lot of flavor and also we're going to do acidic with a fresh lemon back here are the skewers we're going to add the chicken and the vegetables too you see there's like a little sharp point there you just add your chicken onto here now if you don't have these you can also use these bamboo skewers and these bamboo skewers you probably want to soak in water for about 30 minutes before you start threading your chicken and your vegetables on it for the grill because you don't want them to burn now back here I've got red peppers I've got yellow peppers I got a Vidalia Onion and if you'd like to add mushrooms or pineapples to your chicken kebabs that would be fine but let's get this marinated started so we can get this back in the refrigerator because we're going to let this chicken marinate for about 2-3 hours so here we're going to add the garlic the soy sauce the olive oil and your brown sugar and peppercorns now the brown sugars in there so when you put it on the grill you can get a little bit of carmelization on your chicken as its grilling you want to mix these ingredients very well together and then you're going to go ahead and pour them right over here on your chicken tenders now you can just buy chicken breast and cut it into bite-size pieces this is going to go back in the refrigerator I forgot to add my lemon so let's go back here I'm just cutting into here and you can just take a fork stick it in there move it around and give it a nice little squeeze you won't have to worry about the seeds getting into your your marinating sauce here all right now we're just going to go ahead move the chicken tenders around so we can get that marination on all sides of the chicken tenders and google hoodies are going to be yummy and as a matter of fact for good measure I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to add this other lemon the southern fresh lemon right in here give the chicken nothing better than women and chicken together one of my favorite things with a little bit of garlic and then we'll just move them around yeah try to put your lemon into your your sauce before you pour it over the chicken bed if you forget like I just did no big deal all right now these are going to go covered just take some plastic cover it up now it's back in the refrigerator for a good two to three hours and make sure it's covered very well and I'll come back and I'll show you how to cut up vegetables I am going to cut up a red bell pepper a nice sweet red bell pepper and as you know there's smells and females when it comes to the bell pepper world the male bell pepper has four sections as you can see whereas the female which is the yellow bell pepper here only has three the females with three sections are sweeter like in salads or sauteing where your mail bell peppers hold up a little better with high heat so I'm going to go ahead cut these into bite-sized pieces as you can see and I'm going to add this by alternating with the chicken onto our kabobs now I've decided that I am using a bamboo skewer so we're going to just get these in bite-sized pieces I have a Vidalia sweet onion here just going to cut it in half like this and then we're going to cut it this way and then this way and pull out that outer layer of skin nice layer pull back and then what we're going to do is we're going to cut these into just get this out of the way and we're going to cut these into sections okay let's do four sections and put them over here in our bowl now I'm going to cut up the yellow bell pepper and then I'm just going to go ahead and add this to our Bowl as well now if you want to add mushrooms or anything else that's great but I'm also adding a little sweetness of pineapples to our kabob so I'm put that in there and the reason that I'm putting all this in a bowl is because I'm going to drizzle it with a little olive oil and that way it'll keep it nice and fresh and keep it from burning so here go a little olive oil we're just going to go ahead and a little bit of kosher salt and a little bit of fresh black pepper and give it a toss all right just going to give it a toss and now I'm going to go over here and tear those apart I'm going to go over here in the refrigerator and I'm going to get the chicken and we're going to alternate the chicken and the vegetables here on our skewers all right whew that looks lovely I'll be back alright I've taken my chicken that's been marinating for about four hours out of the refrigerator and the best way to get your chicken and your bell peppers and onions on the skewers is just add a piece of chicken first you're just going to thread it on as you can see I thread I thread it on since I've got tenders like this go through it as you can see oh and that's going to be a lovely piece of chicken to munch into and then I'm just going to add onions put your skewer right into there slide it up now in all reality I like to use two skewers together that way when you put these on the grill they're not going to roll around on you but today I'm limited on my skewers so I'm just adding I'm just choosing one all right now don't jam your vegetables and your chickens really close together that way you'll have a little room in between to where your vegetables and your chicken can cook so I'm doing a chicken tender I'm doing the onion red bell pepper yellow bell pepper and then I'm just going to thread on another chicken tender I've got my onion then I'm going to go for a red pepper and then it's yellow wow this smells so good what we've marinating the chicken in and then also in the end I'm just going to polish it off with a couple of pineapples that way we can have a little sweetness with our chicken and our bell peppers and onions all right look how beautiful that is chicken onions red bell pepper yellow bell pepper and then we got chickens and red bell pepper yellow bell pepper and you got your little pineapples and then we'll put them over here on a cookie sheet here's our chicken kebabs ready to go on a grill on medium high heat for the next 15 minutes and all you need to do is turn it about every two to three minutes and then after 15 minutes you're going to have these fabulous delicious grilled chicken kebabs ready for the grill one at a time till you have them all six on there and look house crumbs just those are going to be now remember to turn them every two to three minutes three minutes are up and now it's time to turn and if they stick a little bit give them a wiggle flip them over Oh looky there see those grill marks on there whoo whoo that's what we're looking for hey then we can just tickle them around flip it over and
