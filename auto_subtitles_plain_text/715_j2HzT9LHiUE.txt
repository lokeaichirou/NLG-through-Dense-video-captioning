 Zoe you can of course buy dumpling wrappers which are easy to get but it's also pretty easy to make your own it takes a bit longer to do but I'm gonna show you how to make them hi grace what I'll start with is two and a half cups of plain flour which I'll put into the bowl here as long as it's not self raising because you wanted to stay nice and flat noted that I'm gonna add one cup of cold water straight in the middle here like this you can start mixing that around nice and gently and some sesame oil I've got a little bit of sesame all here a better teaspoon is what your need in there and also to season it up grab about a teaspoon of salt to mix in there now you sort of mix it through with a wooden spoon to get it going but for me I like to get my hands and the wooden spoons good but I reckon you sort of get in there and just sort of need it up it's great isn't it so I'll just move that around like that and I'll just put this bowl aside and I'll just give this a little bit of a need on the board here like this so it just sort of comes together and it looks a little bit dry but as it sits there it'll actually soften up a little bit so all I'll do is pop the tea towel on top of it and let it sit back now we've got to make the filling I've got some pork mince there which I'll get you to put that straight into the bowl here and with my knife I've seemed to get some of these prawns and what I've got is the prawns with their tails so I'll just take little tails off like that and if you can get that garlic they're just about half a clove of garlic on the fine grater and the same with the ginger straight into that bowl here you could use some mushrooms in there it's you can sort of build it up with whatever you want and these prawns here were you know just lying around the fridge so I thought I'd chop them up and I'll chop them up like this so they go all the way through it really really well now what I've got here is some Chinese cabbage and what I do is I just shredded it nice and fine and just so tight in the pan to be kind of sauce sweeter then normal cabbage as well it's a great cabbage you can do anything with it you know and what I've got here is some coriander you can put as much in it as you want also to just chop it up like this you know what kaffir lime leaves in this beautiful laughs there's kaffir lime leaves I think they're just gorgeous in their flavor and therefore some onion flavor I've just got these spring onions I make it really chunky and course you know it doesn't need to be really fine but I reckon this is sort of nice and rustic I have her garlic chives really pungent and strong but I reckon they go really well dumplings and that's why they mix that around like that right it's insulting it and have you put any soy sauce in there yes I say if you grab the soy sauce I'll put a pinch of salt in it about a teaspoon or a key you don't need a lot in there I've got some pepper here nice and cause I love the Asian flavor with pepper I think it really sort of sets things off so that's the mixture there now while I'm waiting for my dough to rest just to keep everything nice to safe we pop this in the fridge then we'll clear this up then we'll roll out our dough and we'll be ready to make our pot sticking dumplings sounds like fun have a look at this Zoey a little rest so see that's nice and sort of soft and much easy to work with and I roll it out into a nice little log and what I'll do is I'll just get some of this flour is that rice flour or any flour just plain flour once you've got into log like that what I do is cut these little sort of round pieces along and from the recipe like this you'll get you know between twenty and thirty dumplings depending on how big you want them but I'll just show you this so what I do is grab one of these things here and with my thumb just sort of dust it with a bit of flour and just sort of push it out just gently so it goes into a nice sort of brown all the way again it is and I've also got this thing which is a little piece of dowel or you know a piece of broom handle which you can cut off just don't get caught cutting it off around my house now I'm gonna sort of leave it a little bit sort of thick because I want to fry them off and I want it to be nice and sort of chunky and let's see how easy it is but that little piece is done but I reckon what you've made about ten or twenty of these you'll sort of get the hang of it really well the trick is when you're doing them it's keep a little bit of flour on your finger so it stops it from sticking now you've got the Rathore there now the thing is when you're using pork and prawn raw meat like that instead of living it on the bench you know waiting for your dough to rest you must put it in the fridge and keep it nice and cold now what we've got here is our little dough and I'm just gonna grab about a tablespoon of this and that little jug over there you can pass me that little jerk cuz that's what we're gonna use to seal it and all I do is grab a little bit of water here or vinegar or whatever you want to use just around the outside here and all you do is just sort of fold it over like that nice and neatly and with your finger sort of pinch it that if I'd be making millions of these I'd have a little way of folding them but I like the little crescent shape because look at that that's a great one Zoe so all we need to do is make a few more of these just spread them out and the best way to do it is sort of like a little production line sort of thing so that you do a few once there we go just a little teaspoon and you know what putting the garlic and ginger in there is nice and healthy you know look at that in no time at all we've managed to put together a few little wonky dumplings there we go the process now and then in my pan here this is the way we're going to cook them I reckon a great way is what we call the pot stickers okay where they're nice and sort of crisp on one side and and they sort of crunchy and we've got a little bit of water and now I'll show you how to do it and what I've got is my pan on a medium heat and what I'll do is I'll put some olive oil if you can pass me that olive oil over there it's a bit like the Japanese gyoza exactly the same this is how you do it I'll put a little bit of olive oil in there but you could use vegetable oil peanut oil you know and I've got some sesame all here so I've put a couple of drops of that in there that'll sort of flavor a lovely good idea now the trick with these is not to overcrowd the pan if you put too many in and they stick together there's nothing worse you want sort of spread them around you just sort of arrange them in the pan they're on a medium issue sort of heat because you don't want to get them too hot what you want to do is actually fry them on the outside till they become nice and crisp on the bottom and then I'm gonna pour some water in there just about a quarter of a cup which will help to steam it and cook the outside of the dumpling and then I'll show you a little trick to finish it off there you go Zoe have a look at that that looks like it's cooked to perfection a little bit soft on one side and crunchy on the other you know give it a bit of a turnaround and all you do is just pop that straight on the plate like that what I'll do is I'll get one of these and I'll just cut it in half so so these excuse my fingers but I just want to show show you exactly what I mean the porks cooked the prawns cooked to get that lovely dumpling I want you to have a taste of that and I want you to tell me what it's like oh it's hot it's very hot mmm the pastry is much thicker than I'm used to having but the flavors are really lovely that's what it's about just quick and easy dumplings fried nice and crispy I can't wait to try your steamed buns oh all right they're gonna be a little lighter gonna be delicious and we can compare the two you
