 hi I'm YouTube's Donal skien and I hear you're looking for a great breakfast recipe here's a doozy Eggs Benedict is an absolute classic brunch recipe and it is comprised of toasted English muffins beautiful sharp and buttery hollandaise sauce and creamy poached eggs a little bit of savory ham as well it is simple to make but you need to take time and concentrate I have two eggs in a large heatproof bowl give them a good whisk up and we're gonna stick these over a pan of simmering water so as this simmers away and starts to heat up we're gonna add one or two knobs of butter and slowly but surely this is gonna melt into our sauce right we're gonna add more butter in and you kind of have to keep doing it and keep going and you'll notice that the sauce starts to thicken up under the piece or over the heat and it's just a case of adding more and more butter until you have a nice voluptuous sauce so I'm adding my final little bit of butter in here and once that's melted down we have a fantastic hollandaise sauce that just needs a kick of flavor from some lemon juice and some sea salt I'm going to take it off the heat at this point give this a last quisque through and you can see how beautiful and yellow that hollandaise sauce is it just needs to be hit with a tiny touch of lemon juice give that lemon a little bit of a roll on the board and a quick squeeze it only needs about a teaspoon of lemon juice and if you're doing this squeezing it straight in do do it through your hands so you get any of those pips left okay should do me little hit of some sea salt in here will make all the difference in terms of flavor you could add a bit of black pepper in there but I don't think purists would be too happy give it a little whisk through it should maintain that thickness even when you add the lemon juice and that my friends is a very delicious and simple hollandaise sauce set this aside we now need to talk about our poaching liquid for our eggs I have this come to a rolling simmer and you don't want it to be a really hard boil you want it to be a nice steady simmer keep it on a low temperature we're adding a tablespoon of white wine vinegar now the theory is that a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and the pinch of salt I'm going to add now will make all the difference to bring in your poached eggs together the wet that I use is slightly different because normally everyone goes in there and swirls it around I'm just swirling it very gently to dissolve the salt but I don't actually swirl my water I just pop my egg in very gently because it is poached eggs or something that not everyone gets right so this is my little trick and it's the way I always make my poached eggs it's always a very simple one and even if you never postin egg before this method I hope I can guarantee will work for you so in a little cup bring your cup right to the edge of the water and just drop it on in okay my egg has had its time and there is a tendency when they come out of the water that they look a little bit miserable so if you have these little extra bits that are our aim besides just use a porter knife and chop it off so you have a nice edge to your lovely folks a fantastic [Music] got my poached eggs got my hollandaise and now it's time to assemble I have some toasted English muffins and we're going to just assemble these up with a little bit of ham on the bottom here I've got nice thinly sliced pieces of ham and they really do add a lovely savory kick so I always use ham but you can do it with smoked salmon you can add a little bit of cooked spinach in here is quite nice as well so really this is a recipe you can adapt to your own liking but this is more of the classic way of serving it so we've got a nice little bit of ham and now it's time for our fantastic poached eggs straight on top with your poached eggs beautifully poached so that you have that runny yolk and nicely set egg white just lift very gently on top and what brings together this whole dish is that wonderful hollandaise sauce so the last itlook whisk through just so that it is nice and ready I'm gonna lose my whisk take a big spoon or a small small spoon in this case and just spread that over the top look at that fantastic flavors really sharp hollandaise sauce and when you dive through that egg yolk you are in business the only thing this needs now is a little fresh hit of some chives over the top I'm just going to give them a quick snip with the scissors I'm kind of going a little bit creative here now but I quite like that just a nice little snip gives you all that wonderful sort of onion flavor and you can give it a final touch of some black pepper and then that my friends is a serious breakfast and a hat I'm gonna give it that little cracked black pepper the last thing to do now is slice right through that so you get really nice yolk pouring I'm going to get you to come in and have a look oh yes this is what your egg Benedict is all about dripping egg yolk wonderful hollandaise sauce and that savory ham there just give me mmm that has to be one of my absolute favorite breakfasts that I now have all over my hand it
