 and why why is this a favorite comfort this is that my dad loved to cook for us my dad passed away about three years ago but he loved to cook and this was one of his favorite meals to make especially when my sister and I were living in California we would come all the way across the country to come home there's my dad when my husband David that was at her wedding shower in Atlanta which is where he brought us a copy of the New York Times cookbook and that for him that recipe in the book was always the basis for his beef Burgundy or is he preferred to say bull bull genome because he liked to say it in French there is cooking in my in my kitchen in San Francisco with the red cabbage so in honor of my dad we're making boeuf bourguignon this morning winter new to me and I do speak French and my sister looking friend very well so we have a big love for all things French in my family this is got French wine in it they can't don't know which is why we're each starting out with a glass of wine because my dad would also recommend perhaps having a glass of something as you're cooking it certainly can't hear okay as we would say in France first you're gonna start with your meat so the first thing that you're gonna do Tom sorry I'm giving you the wine of making you put it down right you want it you want to salt and pepper it right on both sides and one little trick I learned from our good friend Bobby Flay you let die hi hi when yourself it's sugar salt and pepper this liberally all right you do it on both sides and the interest of time on television then you take it you're gonna put it in a bag with about a third of a cup of flour cuber a bunch I would do but several at a time otherwise it would take you all day get him in there what you're gonna do is shake it around cook them really well and that what you would do what Lester's already involved in okay I've been doing we cooked a little bit of bacon in the pan and one of my well-loved registering something here yep and then after you take the bacon out in that bacon grease a little extra olive oil you start browning the meat so we've got some Brown here so Lester once it gets brown you want to start to take it out so we'll take it out and put it in here and you want to try to leave some of the juice in here as you take the meat out and that's because we're gonna use that to get a little bit more flavor from the from the rest of the dish I'm just moving in here my friend having a place to them just love I don't know so we take all the meat out and then you're gonna take some brandy here okay this goes into the pot and you're going to deglaze the pot supporting kind of slowly and then the whole time the Brandy's in there you just want to scrape up those yummy Brown ah okay and so this will take you up a couple of minutes and this will actually turn into a nice lovely sort of creamy concoction as you're getting all these bits together it's gonna burn off a little bit yeah so what we would do then is we'd put some mix them in with the meat what we're gonna do now is and then what would be left in the pan would kind of clean off the pan a little bit we're gonna modify it for TV add some butter and olive oil okay and then Dylan's gonna put the vegetables in we've got leeks we've got onions carrots put it all in what happens that tomato paste tomato paste is coming after so we're gonna put our vegetables for a little bit then you would add in the tomato paste okay leeks and garlic leeks and garlic you're gonna cook it all down till it's really soft then we would put the meat and the bacon back in along with a number of different herbs and spices so we had I use ground cloves bay leaves a lot of time a lot of parsley you're gonna throw in we would put it put in deep stock yes but you know we're actually gonna do going to move down here in the interest of time so put all these things in cook it for 20 minutes throw in the oven for about an hour you saute some onions and some mushrooms dill and we throw those mushrooms in adament at the end give it a good mix I'm gonna steal the spoon and voila you have beef Burgundy it's a party it's a very hearty meal and one of the best things you can do is make it a head I actually made mine on Tuesday I froze it for friends who are coming over so dinner okay freezes beautifully so we're gonna take at a position and just to let you know you can find the recipes online along with a little bit more about my awesome dad speed at today.com up next we have more from New Orleans and we're gonna have breakfast
