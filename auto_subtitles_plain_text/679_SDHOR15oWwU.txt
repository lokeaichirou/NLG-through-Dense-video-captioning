 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens classics where i recreate some of my original videos for you today I'm going to be making the first ever video that I uploaded here to the Nicko's kitchen channel of course I'm talking about my spaghetti and meatballs so guys the first thing that we're going to do to get started on my spaghetti and meatballs just into a large pot we're gonna start making our sauce so first thing is just some olive oil and I'm gonna be putting in it some onion that I've just roughly chopped up I'm also gonna be adding in some bacon that I've just chopped up as well I'm not gonna season with some salt because the bacon is quite salty and I'm also gonna be adding in some garlic paste and just give that a good mix around and I just want you to cook this down for about two minutes just until that onion starts to soften so once the onions have softened the next thing I'm gonna be adding into some chopped up mushrooms and again just give that a mix around and just pop the mushrooms for a further minute just until they just slightly soften again now the onion that the bacon of the onion is cooking along nicely and now I'm gonna be adding in some tomato paste and next I'm going to add in a can of chopped tomatoes and very last I'm gonna be adding in some chopped parsley some fresh parsley now what I want you to do is turn the heat down to low and I want you to simmer this for 20 to 25 minutes so while our sauce is cooking away there we're gonna get started on making our meatballs now with my meatballs I just used beef and it's an 80/20 split meaning it's 80% beef 20% fat because we store in our meatballs to be nice and juicy now to our beef I'm gonna be adding in some dried breadcrumbs I'm also gonna add in a dried Italian herbs mix I'm gonna season with some salt and pepper next thing I'm gonna be adding in some garlic paste next I'm gonna add in some fresh basil now next thing I've got some Parmesan cheese just in here some fresh Parmesan cheese I'm just gonna grate it just in there and lastly I'm gonna be adding in just an egg that I've just beaten up make sure your hands are clean and you want to get in there for this because it's all about making the meatballs so you want to get your hands straight in and work all those ingredients into the beef so we've got a mixture there guys now what I want you to do it's just break a piece off and just roll up in your hands just like that and this is the size that I like my balls if you want them bigger than get a bigger if you want them smaller then make them smaller it's completely up to you and just keep repeating that process with the rest of the mixture so our meatballs are done and what I'm gonna do now is just Brown them off so browning our meatballs just into a large pan on a low to medium heat I've got some olive oil so just as easy as this I'm just gonna place our meatballs into the pan now I'm only gonna be browning them off I don't want to cook them all the way through I just want to get some nice color on the outside and I only want to brown these off for about two minutes so that's what we're after with our meatballs just browning off on the outside hey guys I'm gonna be adding back in our pasta mix to our meatballs so I'm just gonna be pouring them over now I'm gonna turn the heat down to a low heat and again I'm going to simmer this for a further 20 minutes so are we just waiting for our meatballs to finish off I'm gonna make a very quick easy homemade garlic bread to go with it so just into a small bowl I've got some melted butter to that I'm gonna add in some fresh basil that I've just chopped up and of course I'm gonna be adding in some garlic paste to the buzzer so just give that a good mix around and guys what I've got here is a Turkish bread that I've just sliced in half I love this stuff but you can use any sort of bread that you're after so what I want you to do just put this under the grill and toast it so without bread toasted I'm just using a brush and I'm just gonna brush that bread with our garlic butter and basil mixture so our garlic breads done it's time now just this bad boy out just to finish it off I've just got some fresh parsley just on the top there and of course I've served it with some pasta so there you have it I've recreated my first ever dish that I gave you here on Nico's kitchen let's get stuck into this bad boy I'm gonna go straight for one of these meatballs that looks so yummy and it smells wonderful let's go-o-o straight up get stuck into this garlic bread oh yeah so I hope you've enjoyed this recreation of a classic Neko dish all the ingredients are below so check it out and I'll see you tomorrow for budget meals so until then take care
