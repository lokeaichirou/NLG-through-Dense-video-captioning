 [Music] hi everyone thank you for tuning in to cook with April on tasty Tuesday today we are going to make chicken parmesan or parmesan chicken however you want to say it it is so delicious and tender and moist so go ahead and mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a bowl and mix those ingredients together and then transfer it onto a plate it's easier to coat your chicken on a plate than you would in a bowl so now go ahead and grab any chicken breasts of your choice and place it in a ziplock bag and go ahead and use a meat tenderizer and whack it away then grab your chicken breast and rub some salt as well as pepper on each side of the chicken breast then you're going to go ahead and rub some flour on it as well on both sides and then dip your chicken breasts in beaten eggs and go ahead and coat your chicken breasts with a Parmesan cheese bread crumb mixture really pressing firmly so that you completely cover the chicken and while you're doing that preheat the oven to 450 degrees and grab a frying pan and place some olive oil and then you're going to go ahead and fry the chicken for only 3 minutes covering both sides and making it brown this is not to cook the chicken completely it's only to kind of harden the outside layer and then place it in a bake safe pan and add some tomato sauce right on top of the chicken then add mozzarella cheese [Music] and now you are ready to bake bake for about 15 minutes until the chicken breast is cooked and this will have a very delicious crispy outside and tender inside enjoy thank you you know me I I typically prefer chicken thighs but this is chicken breast exactly traditional thing to use but you firms on but that is delicious thank you my gosh it says you know where I technically eat chicken parmesan is that Buca di Beppo if you guys have ever been there you know the amount of cheese on this is perfect it's not too much I love I just love the tomato sauce in right the whole thing it's it's um I hope you're not insulted I think this would take it up a notch with the little sriracha alright let's see how do you like it with your hot sauce oh you want to know yeah oh my god did you know this is my true reaction is I'm not like bingo like over the top this is delicious thank you did you know that I've gotten a lot of comments from a lot of people that have said that they discovered the hot sauce because it really yeah well I'll have you guys know that this is not product placement or anything like that I just love the hugs your dad my dad your dad started buying it I was really young yeah I think started forcing me to put it on my food I think you like it thank you guys so much for tuning in have a beautiful day and we'll see you next Tuesday and if you guys you know are all in here like your first dinner date or your making something for your date this is pretty awesome yeah it's easy but it seems for me yeah that's yeah so stay tuned on Tuesday see you friends bye thank you for tuning in to cook with April on tasty Tuesday today I'm doing a requested video I'm going to show you how to make cream puffs
