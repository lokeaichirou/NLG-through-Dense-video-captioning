 I'm going to start by making the batter here I'm going to add in my flour I will put the full ingredients down below because I'm the only doing half a recipe here at in my cornmeal my sugar salt and baking soda and I'm just going to take a whisk here and whisk this together just kind of make sure that the dry ingredients are work braided together now to this I'm going to add in my milk as well as a egg excuse the yarn I'm just going to whisk this together until it comes together and now that this is mixed together and smooth I'm going to set this off to the side and start working on the hot dogs for the hot dogs I've just got plain old regular hot dogs here you can use all beef if you'd like these just happen to be cheap ones because they were on sale anyway I'm going to cut these into thirds just like so and I'm going to put these into a bowl here that just has some flour in it I'm just going to coat these with the flour so that way the batter sticks better to them alright so I went ahead and shook off all the excess flour on my hot dogs and what I'm going to do is take these and I have my oil heated to 350 degrees over medium heat in a saucepan and I'm just watching that all I'm going to do is do these in small batches since I'm using a small pan here to fry these in I'm just going to put these into the batter and cover these make sure that they get completely coated in your batter and just go ahead and fish them out one by one and carefully lower them into the oil and these don't take very long at all to fry up maybe just a few minutes they will automatically turn themselves when they are done and while these are cooking you want to make sure monitor the temperature of your oil so it doesn't get too hot you'll need to adjust your burner heat either up or down to make sure that it stays right around 350 degrees and when there are nice golden brown go ahead and carefully lift them out and put them onto a paper towel-lined plate or a wire rack if that's what you have and then go ahead and finish frying up the rest of your dogs and once you get all your corn dogs fried up this is what they will look like hope you guys enjoy and thanks so much for watching you
