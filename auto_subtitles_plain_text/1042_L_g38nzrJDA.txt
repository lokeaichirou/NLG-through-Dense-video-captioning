 hello welcome to Dedes in the training catch today I'm going to be preparing a salad called the douche the douche is a Mediterranean or middle-eastern salad that has a lot of different vegetables in it and it has a nice crispy mess which comes from the fried pita bread that's added to it we're going to start off by chopping up some romaine lettuce now we use romaine lettuce because it has a firmer texture that can hold well after it's mixed with the lemon juice that we're going to add later one you want on finely chopped throat Maine lettuce some people use iceberg I prefer romaine and it has more of a taste and more nutrients than ice cream lettuce now I cut it into shreds I'm going to place it want to use a fairly large bowl you want to be able to mix all the ingredients together later on next I'm going to chop up the peppers I'm using three different kinds of peppers I'm using orange red and green you can also use yellow but these peppers have a lot of vitamin C they actually have more vitamin C than oranges do you want to cut them into small small cubes this peppers going off great Zanjeer faced and there's turned out to be about a half cup to 3/4 cup of each kind of pepper and this salad serves about four people now I've already pre sliced everything else except for the cucumber I sliced half of it to show you when I cut it in half and you want to cut in quarters then also you want you know your vegetables to be all kind of the same size so we're there we go there's a cucumber I have a cup of shredded red cabbage or purple cabbage 1/4 cup or about to radishes also chopped up I have one tomato or about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup finely chopped tomatoes I have a quarter cup of shredded carrot I have a quarter cup of diced green onions I have a quarter cup of diced red onion you need yellow onion that's fine and then I have a half cup of chopped parsley now you can add fresh mint or you can add dry mint I like to add dry mint to the salad about a tablespoon of dried mint another ingredient that complements the salad very well is Samak it's about s UMUC it's actually a dried ground berry that's found in tropical climate areas I need to find this at almost all of your grocery stores or your specialty grocery stores you want to add about two tablespoons of dried sumac for the dressing I squeezed two lemons and two garlic's mashed with some salt to this you can add about a quarter cup of olive oil make sure you pick a very good olive oil because it adds a lot of flavor to the salad and also complements all the vegetables and then mix it up a little bit then I'm going to add it to my salad it's good to mix the garlic with the lemon juice and the olive oil so you can get a big chunk of garlic so if you put it in there it might stick together but if you dissolve it in the lemon juice and olive oil it's sure to mix in with all of the other ingredients I've also fried some whole wheat pita bread you can use regular peanut butter you can use whole wheat pita bread I also put it on some napkins to absorb all the excess oil I'm just going to break it up into my chalid like so doesn't have to be chopped or anything just break it up with your fingers you want to fry it in some vegetable oil this until it's brown be careful not to burn include this fryer pretty quickly there we go now you're going to want to mix the whole style together now you can mix it with a spoon or you can mix it with your hands the flavor tastes just as good as the color after you've thoroughly combined the ingredients you want to get a plain colored plate like a white plate because there's so much color in the salad you want to bring it out and a white plate will bring out all of the other colors that are in here just get it hit the plate plate the fattoush in the center of the plate and voila you have a great looking sale and all the colors the crispness of the pita bread you can top this with some grilled chicken some steak eat it with a side of homos or a side of baba ghanoush it's great has so much flavor you can eat it by itself you can eat it for lunch it'll fill you up it's a great salad it looks a little complicated but it's not you just have to chop up all the vegetable you'll have so much fun doing it and you'll get so many compliments enjoy it and join me again for Dee Dee's men training kitchen you
