 I know what's going on it's Lisa here brought food for kids hope you have an awesome day so far I am going to make one of my favorite favorite soups oh it just came back from Whole Foods and they were lining at the pumpkins and it got me thinking you know Halloween little cooler temperatures it got me in the mood for a little bit of a of a warm soup and you know normally when you eat high raw you tend to have a lot of cold stuff and when it starts to get a little cooler out you know it's understandable that you want to maybe have something that's a little more warm and comforting if you're coming in from the cold so last year I became a big fan of miso soup and I've always loved miso soup and it's very very good for you and it's totally raw raw vegan as well and it's so easy to make this has to be probably the cheapest if you're on a budget the least expensive so you could possibly make and it's absolutely delicious and it is just the easiest thing you can make so let me show you do it so what you want to do is you want to start off with we're going to use water obviously miso paste which pick up in your health food store you want the sweet white miso paste organic sweet white miso paste stop with caution eight nine bucks it lasts in the fridge for a very very very long time used for salad dressings and use it for just two you know it's kind of a fermented salty flavor so I think I used it in the Caesar dressing it's really good stuff it will last a long time you you don't need that much of it I'm going to put in some green onions that I've got the I've got four cups of water here the ratio is one tablespoon of miso paste - 1 cup of water and then I've got the tops of two green onions just the green part sliced really thin and then I've got four mushrooms so one mushroom per cup of water and it's finished look how much mushroom it's for yields when you slice it like paper-thin okay so take your time with if you're not comfortable the knife just slice it as thin as you can all right so that's it we have three ingredients really if for if you want to count the water alright so I have a camel you can do it on the stove in the pot just heat up some water what I did was I he dipped the water it was a little too hot I put it at three cups so I could test it and then I added some ice cubes to make it temperature you want you basically you know I hear 115 118 is is kind of you don't want to get past that before you start to actually cook stuff I like to be on the safer end I don't know if 118 is fine but 119 is not fine I don't want to cut it that close so I just stick my finger in it I mean if I can hold my finger and if it's something I you know babe might the water I take a bath in or put my kids in it's okay if I could take my spoon and it's not burning me we're okay I had a thermometer but I guess I need a new battery it's a good thing I pulled it out he gets to get the momma in and see what the temperature is but um alright so I got four cups of water in here and see that I'm gonna add four tablespoons of miso paste so good love it more tablespoons of me soup I'm doing the blender just to mix up this miso really well you can do it by hand or in a whisk or something but I saw foodies here we love our blenders so why not so just just mix this up it's creamy effective so now I just got the blender on super well I'm just gonna stir in that green onion and the mushrooms and the hot water mushrooms will kind of soak that up it's on low it's not going to chop it she's gonna stir it up okay folks thirty seconds later we got beautiful miso soup check it out Asian Bowl stuff some little Asian soup spoons just give it a taste the only thing missing here normally traditionally is a little pieces of tofu she won't miss that so good beautiful lunch in the wintertime you could eat this every day with a nice pretty salad nice beautiful salad and you hope it gets to go so check this out Shh miso soup all right starts gonna look cool you're at just get these three ingredients so easy and you can enjoy yourself some nice soup and no one wants to see it that's burning your mouth anyways this is the perfect temperature it's warm we didn't destroy any live enzymes or anything mmm so good so anyways hope you liked this recipe please subscribe these videos you haven't remember always eat happy foods and please give me a thumbs up if you like you need the recipes appreciating comments check out the links below I'm on Twitter Facebook all that kind of stuff so anyways talk to you real soon take care thanks so much for watching
