 chicken parmigiana is one of the most popular menu items in Italian American restaurants it's really easy to make it home and today I'm gonna show you how and the key to it for me for the whole thing is making sure you have a nice uniform chicken breast which means we're gonna have to use our meat mallet and flatten this one out because you can see that the way a chicken breast is naturally shaped is a little thicker on one side and sort of tapers down at another side chicken parmesan it's gonna cook evenly once we get this all in the same thickness but it's also going to cook quickly which is key also so you get that nice crispy crust so I'm just got I've got triple layer of plastic wrap here you can use a gallon bag at home that's what I do just make sure you've got some good protection I'm gonna use a flat side of my meat mallet and the idea here is to do sort of a sweeping motion so as you come down just sort of pull away from you the idea is not to come straight down on the meat but hit it and sort of pull away from you okay and I use my hand here just to keep the the plastic wrap steady and the plastic wrap just keeps the chicken from sticking and the idea obviously you've got the thinner side so you want to start by pounding the thicker side and again sort of a pulling motion and you'll see that after a couple of good whacks it just starts to move with the mallet and I'm looking for about a quarter of an inch again nice consistency is going to be the key to your success here okay so I've got that pounded and then you can see that's what it looks like a nice even chicken breast great a raw chicken always want to be careful so I'm using tongs okay just to handle the raw chicken and I'll use a completely different set of tongs once I cook it but I'm gonna get rid of my plastic wrap and clear my board okay and then I'm gonna show you the standard breading procedure okay so I have some all-purpose flour of a cup of that I have three eggs here that I've really taken my time and whisk them very very well you want to make sure they're completely broken up and sort of foamy on top of that we are gonna get good coverage and then I have some Italian seasoned breadcrumbs that I also added some more Parmesan Reggiano to just to bump that flavour so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna season the chicken breast with some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper all right we're just building layers of flavor here so obviously we want to make sure this chicken tastes good before we get it into the breading and then I've got a pair of tongs here it makes the job a little cleaner right into the flower and the idea here is to get a nice even coat of everything on top of the chicken breast you want to make sure that there's no spot of your chicken breast that's not covered with flour because we're building a seal here and we're establishing a crust and what we want is to not press it in we just want to make sure it's nicely even coated and if you just get it coated very simply and very easily without trying to get too much on there it's gonna be light as a snowflake and that's kind of what you want you want it to be really really crispy on the outside and you don't want that breading caked on so I just want to make sure even coat all the way through you know you'll see some people really press it down I don't like to do that I like to just flip it a couple of times cover the areas that are still uncovered with all three of these ingredients and there you go you got a perfectly breaded chicken breast right there okay so we're just gonna do that with all four of these chicken breasts and then we're gonna saute them in a pan to golden brown and crispy all right so I've got my pan here preheated medium-high I started with about a half a cup of pure olive oil I want to do these in batches the idea here is to not overcrowd the pan so we get nice even browning again we wanted to pound the chicken so it's nice even thickness we want to get nice even browning as well the crust so chicken parmesan is key so I've already browned too I'm just gonna finish with these last two let the oil get them nice and brown around the outside just a couple of minutes on each side till they're nice and golden brown and then we want them to be at 165 degrees for a finished temperature all right so it's been a couple of minutes I just want to go ahead and check them yeah that's beautiful got that beautiful sort of paper bag Brown that we're looking for you can see the edges get a little crispier than the middle so you get that great textural difference gonna be another couple of minutes on this side and we're gonna build them get them in the oven alright so it's been a couple minutes on this side before I remove them from the pan I just want to get right into the thickest part and again remember these are very evenly pounded so the thickest part could be any of it but I still like to go in the middle just to make sure I'm getting an accurate temperature you know it's chicken so we're looking for 165 degrees you know another thing I like about you know chicken cutlets or breaded cutlets in general is because we're cooking them so quickly they're gonna still be nice and moist then I'm just gonna remove these two paper towel just to drain a little bit of that excess oil off all right and now I've got a clean set of tongs okay cuz this chicken is already cooked we've hit our temperature and I'm gonna move it over to my cookie sheet that I have lined with some parchment paper I always think it's a great idea to line any tray that I'm using for baking with parchment paper really makes cleanup a lot easier okay I'll just go ahead now that these have had a chance to drain again same idea here we didn't overcrowd the pan we were browning them I don't want to overcrowd the pan when I'm baking them as well so I can just go ahead and get rid of that okay and now this is the fun part and this is what everybody always likes about chicken parmesan you've got some delicious seasoned tomato sauce here and I'm just gonna go ahead and parse out over these chicken breasts and you want to be again.we I've talked about layering for this whole recipe you don't want to have too much of anything you want to have just enough so you get a little bite of sauce crispy chicken and cheese in every single bite that's that's the idea so I'll just spread that out and I'll just going to take the back of my spoon and sort of push it out almost to the edge so perfect we've got that I've got a little bit of whole milk mozzarella cheese same idea as the sauce now this cheese is gonna melt and it's gonna spread out a little bit as it melts so I try to keep it a little bit more towards the center just to accommodate for that but the good news is when it melts off the side to get those beautiful crispy brown bits of cheese I sort of stick to the pan I always like to eat those all right and again chicken parmesan I want to Gilda Lily just a little bit here I've got a little more Parmesan Reggiano remember I put that in the seasoned breadcrumbs during the breading process and I want to just take a little bit more as a nice sort of nutty and salty quality to the mozzarella which is going to get all warm and soft and gooey there you go chicken parmesan gonna put it in the oven for just a few minutes get that cheese melted get that sauce hot and we're gonna be ready to go alright that's about eight minutes in the oven and that's exactly what I'm looking for cheese is all soft and gooey sauce is hot classically I'll always serve this with just a nice simple pasta simple tomato sauce you know and this is perfect right there textbook classic chicken parmesan everybody in your family is gonna like it it's a great meal and the leftovers taste just as good the next day to try it at home
