 today's feel-good food is miso soup with tofu it's fantastically nutritious low calorie low fat and can be prepared in well under 10 minutes we're going to make the stop using miso paste mirin and soy and then fill it out with oyster mushrooms tofu and edamame beans okay they'll start me to make a stock so a couple of cups of water into our pan and bring that up to a boil and to our water we're gonna add our miso soup paste okay so this is already a combination of miso paste so fermented beans and minted rice that's cured with salt and then dashi stock gained a she studies really intensive an apple but obviously gonna add it to the water and thin it right out so squeeze that in there is this easy to get hold of this pre-made pastes the pre-made stuff the miso soup very easy you'll get that in most supermarkets if you want to actually make your own then you need the dashi powder at the museo de paste you might use an Asian supermarket 10 days but pre-mixed dead easy to that we're also gonna add half a vegetable stock you okay okay and then we've got mirin sorry about two tablespoons of mirin and one tablespoon of soy am I gonna have to guess this roughly cuz it's all about mixing and we taste later and had it and amend it tell me when to stop so that's about two tablespoons of mirin okay which is a sweet rice wine and then one tablespoon so half as much of soy all we need to do is heat that very gently you don't really want to boil it okay because that's when it kind of goes cloudy you want to keep it a very very gentle simmer and then we can add in all other flavors we've got waster mushrooms so your split already yes coming together now these we just want to slice and some nice thin slices if you can do majority of that Bowl and we've also got edamame beans well these you can buy frozen soya beans just defrost them and we're gonna add those to the soup as well I've had these in restaurants where they're still in the pot and there was salty on the outside yes you can I had to get them in their pods or even easier still I think frozen and out of the pods treat me exactly as you would peas or proteins it's gonna be pretty quick to make them seriously speedy I mean we're nearly halfway there if we put all the mushrooms in with our beans they need to very gently kind of heat up and simmer for two or three minutes just to soften the mushrooms and warm the beans through and that's pretty much it this is really speedy kind of a diet friendly great tasting suit you can throw together in minutes this is fresh tofu we need to do is take it and cut it into really neat little squares remember we serve it we're gonna start with a small spoon see what bits it gonna fit on the spoon so we can cut it into pieces the thing with tofu is it has very little if any flavor it's so subtle but remember all the flavor we've got going on here yeah it will take on all that flavor flavor Spanish it's like a flavor sponge that's really good for you those mushrooms need of another few seconds to warm through and then I'll tofu can go into the meantime we can look at our spring onions if you can just do a very very fine shred the finer the better and they're going to go in really last-minute little ears we service looking with that crunch and that fresh kind of spring onion kick this is our last ingredient yeah that is how simple this is but I promise you when you taste it you will be impressed you can see we've made about two portions here but if you're gonna make it you might actually make a big fat and then you can actually use it throughout the week so you can we just take it to work in a flask keep warm or you can just reheat it a bit at a time throughout the course of a couple of days just as easily but our tofu can go in now do you have to use tape or is there something else that you've replaced it with if you ain't gettin like Toki I think once you've got the base the mise au flavors then you can add what you want so some we shredded punch a chicken would work nicely or some prawns again anything that's lean high in protein will fit perfectly in this dish okay to finish it off all of these spring onions you to be sliced go in there and that's it it's so simple that is the soup done all we like to do is serve it make sure you get plenty of mushroom plenty of tofu you notice soup when people say oh when you're ill you know see ya exactly that's so much health in one bowl we've got our spoons as well now have a taste do what we think of everything in my spoon hmm good right yeah really good really fresh and
