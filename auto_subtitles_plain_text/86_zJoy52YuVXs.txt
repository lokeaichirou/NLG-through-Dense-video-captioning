 so let's start with the sort of almost the simplest pizza that everybody loves called Pizza Margherita which is just your very simple tomato sauce fresh mozzarella some parmesan and a few basil leaves you know there are a lot of jarred sauces on the market I don't particularly like them I think they're too sweet and too heavy and too heavily seasoned so all I do is I take a can of tomatoes this cost two dollars and 25 cents add some salt and put it through this gizmo which is a food mill if you don't have a food mill you can just crush them with your hands so just put our food mill over a bowl turn the tank this is a great activity for kids actually turning the crank on this or even better crushing them with their hands just have it all ready so see we've we've broken up the tomatoes but we haven't pureed them so then 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and just mix that up for a pizza this size I would say a third of a cup of sauce is the most you want to use and the first time you do it and measure or you're going to end up using too much it's just only about that much and spread it around leaving a border of about an inch to 1/2 inch on the side it doesn't seem like enough but trust me it is then the parmesan again about a third of a cup just sort of a nice handful and then mozzarella but just a few slices and you don't want to cover the whole surface of the pizza you know that's really enough a few basil leaves four or five is enough so simple delicious beautiful the colors of the Italian flag so then we put it into our very hot oven and I use a pizza stone on the oven but if you don't have one again just turn a baking sheet upside down and put it in the oven and get it nice and hot you want this to go immediately on to a hot surface so we'll just slide it in here and cook for six to eight minutes so here we go our pizza margherita this looks good the crust is nice and brown the cheese is melted as running all over the pizza and we'll just dress it with just a little olive oil
