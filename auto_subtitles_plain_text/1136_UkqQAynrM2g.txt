and all I'm going to do is cook my pasta according to package directions I'm using an induction range which is really handy because it actually boils water in under two minutes let me tell you that can go a long way when you're cooking pasta once my pasta is cooked through I'm going to drain it in a colander and then run it under some cold water to stop the cooking process next it's time to mix up a really simple sauce for this pasta salad and it's really just a matter of mixing some pesto with some balsamic vinegar all I'm going to do is whisk the two together and what you end up with is this sweet and savory sauce that has a ton of flavor I'm going to pour the sauce over my pasta and give it a good toss until it's evenly coated then I'm going to add some more beautiful caprese flavor with some cherry tomatoes that I've just cut in half some mini mozzarella balls and some freshly chopped basil I'm going to give it all one more toss and this pasta salad is ready to enjoy this fresh

next up I've got my amazing BLT pasta salad with a delicious homemade Italian dressing now for this recipe I'm actually using or folly which are these adorable little bow ties which I think really adds a sense of occasion to this pasta salad for the be in this BLT pasta salad we are going to fire up some bacon in a skillet on the stove I've got four or five slices of bacon over medium heat I'm going to cook it until it's nice and crispy and golden brown then I'm just going to remove it from the skillet and drain it on some paper towels next it's time to get to work on my yummy Italian dressing it all starts with some olive oil in a bowl to that I'm going to add some red wine vinegar some fresh lemon juice and some minced garlic next I've got some dried herbs I've got some dried parsley some dried basil and some dried oregano I'm going to season this up with some salt and some pepper and then give it a good whisk now because this dressing comes together so easily I like to make a big batch and then store it in my refrigerator for up to five days my French has all these handy adjustable bins and shelves that make it easy to make space for tall bottles like this this

the wonderful flavors of a classic BLT and a ton of great crunch finally today I'm going to show you my incredibly fresh summer veggie pasta salad for this recipe I am using all sorts of gorgeous summer vegetables like green beans red bell peppers and zucchini that I got from my local farmers market but it's also so versatile you can really use any kind of fresh veggies you like I like to
