 hi everybody this is Shai again on today's special we're gonna make some chapati chapati is one of the most known Indian bread I bet that are millions of chapati made everyday chappati is very easy to make it tastes wonderful and every Indian meal is going to be much better if it's served with chapati I want to start this video by showing you how chappati is made on the streets of India of course there are modern bakeries in India that make thousands of chapati every day this was shot on the streets of al-abaad where restaurant owners prefer to make their chapati their chapati is made in many different ways you can find chapati made in a special oven you can find chapati made on the stove on a special skillet knowing that I'm gonna make some chapati at home I bought in India this metal skillet but if you don't have it you can do it on a heavy pan trying to imitate the Indian though I came up with the dough of my own I'm using a mixer but you can do it by hand we're gonna start by putting two cups of flour in a ball we're gonna put one teaspoon of dry yeast and then one teaspoon of sugar in the center let it mix dry add three to four tablespoons of vegetable oil mix it a little bit and then add water first to the center of the dough we're gonna put about half a cup in the center of the dough let the dough collect the flour from the sides of the bowl and mix it now we're gonna start to add some water to the sides the idea is to get to a very flexible consistency but not too soft if you put too much water you can add some flour if the dough is too tough you can add a little bit of water all together I've added about one cup of water into this mix now the secret you get though similar to the chapati dough is to add whole wheat flour at the end of the process so I wanna get first a very flexible dough just like that now I'm going to add half a cup of whole wheat flour and mix it together if you see that the flour doesn't stick to the dough you can add a little bit of water after about 5 minutes the dough should be ready now we're going to take the dough and cut it to pieces to about ten pieces now we want to shape the dough to little balls just like that if you're not comfortable in doing it with one hand you can shape it any way you want now it's time to open the dough and make the chapati to open the dough I'm using a pasta maker which I find very very comfortable to work with I've set the machine to the thickest opening possible and then I run the dough once and then I run it again now I'm going to switch to one or three levels above which was gonna make it thinner next step is to stretch the dough from the sides to make it round as you see the dough is very flexible so it's very easy now this is the piece of metal I've told you before I've preheated it on the stove and then I'm gonna put the dough on top of it on fast motion this is how it should look now I'm gonna turn it to the other side next step is to put it on some open fire just like that and the chapati is ready we're gonna make another one we're gonna turn it over then we're gonna put it on the open fire again that's it our chapatis ready we're gonna repeat this process with the rest of the dough you can see in India and around the world many people eat with the chapati they tear a little part of the bread and then they scoop the dishes with it dishes like chana masala or aloo Gobi or whatever Indian dish possible it tastes wonderful that's it I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please subscribe to my channel thanks for watching take care
