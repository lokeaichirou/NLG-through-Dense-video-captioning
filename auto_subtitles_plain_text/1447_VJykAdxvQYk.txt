 hey how you doing Jax Califronia here and you're cooking with Jack and I I almost didn't ever come back again after that Yorkshire pudding episode that was pretty embarrassing so you guys are too kind I have to say that we are redoing we're not redoing pickles looks like all of you want me to redo the Yorkshire pudding and get it right this time so that's coming up what else coming up oh we're going to be doing my tomato plant update topsy-turvy that's coming up we have a lot of things coming up so let me first show you what I got for Father's Day and I'm really excited I got it a little bit early I know but I'm pretty pumped so let's bring you in real close you take a look at this bad boy as you notice you probably already know I already told you I'm getting but if you notice there's no knives up there and there's no knives down there so let me show you what I got I went to this place called prep kitchen essentials in Seal Beach they have all the cool toys and if you remember chef Elizabeth Witt came on the show that's where she does a lot of her courses for cooking courses dah dah dah it is shown that's right it is the Japanese knife company so this is it this is my new Father's Day gift and I'll be using this from now on I also ordered the the paring knife that's the other thing that I'll need I'll leave this in the paring knife and I'm going to try and do my show for a whole year at least with this knife and the paring knife when it arrives I'm pumped I can't tell you a new knife and a grilling episode what else could a guy want now once again if you notice all my grilling episodes I do all the preparing the night before I grill so I usually marinate the meats or rub the meats or seasoned the meats and that's exactly we're doing this episode this is going to be our jerk recipe okay and we're using scallions cloves I'm using habanero it normally asked for two scotch bonnet chilies but I couldn't find them so I'm going with two habaneros which is just as good this could be the heat in the jerk recipe and then we have ground allspice we have shallots it asks for three in the recipe I'm only doing these or two big ones so that should be enough some kosher salt or you can use a coarse salt fresh ground pepper and then obviously some fresh thyme from the store I love how they do this they give you this package you can almost just plant it the roots are like right there and they're cool we're going to cut these about and bunch those up fingers in like we're taught we're going to cut them about one inch okay seven inch long with the habaneros they're really hot if you want it really hot you're going to leave the seeds in if you want it a medium hot leave one of the seeds in and see the other if you want it milder just take all the seeds out okay now me personally I'm leaving all the seeds in so we're going to we're going to take the ends off here there we go this recipe here is all down below so don't I take notes just check it out and watch it happen okay let's put all the pieces in you ready I'll put in the scallions put in the shallots this is most of it right here now I know it looks full but I don't want to go to the big one because it's going to be hard to get this to mix so don't panic we're going to get this all in okay what I'm going to do is on the top is down first then we put the rest of our ingredients okay so don't even worry about that let's do that first give it a quick chopping then we put all the seasonings in there we go see now there's plenty of room to put more stuff in put the garlic in hahaha habaneros boy I think that's gonna be pretty hot but we'll see okay black pepper all spice kosher salt and here we go to make it all smooth it's going to be a quarter cup of oil I'm just going to put in half of it right now to get it started don't put it in again in a minute take a look at it there it is okay you don't want to make these too big you want to cut these in big set and big chunks okay because we're going to put them on shish kebob so I'm thinking like maybe quarters slice in half I like big pieces they're going to shrivel up a little bit first thing we do we're going to get this in the bag carefully remove the blade if you're using one of these ninjas or any kind of a processor pour this in the bag put some of that in there I'll fish that out later trust me can the zip close that then you're going to switch it all around that get some jerk chicken right there it's gonna be amazing all right we'll let that marinate overnight let's get busy on the vegetables shish kabob tips there are a few of them and I'm going to teach them to you right now first one is you could do this overnight you can do it an hour before you're ready to cook soak these in water if you're using wood wood skewers you're going to want to soak these in water that prevents the sticks from burning the other thing is you're going to notice that when we put the meat and vegetables on the sticks put your meat on one stick put your vegetables on a different stick I know it looks better presentation wise if you put your vegetables with your meat you're going to burn the vegetables the meat will cook longer okay they'll need to be on there longer so you always cook your vegetables separate okay so I'm not going to bore you with cutting these all these vegetables up but basically I'm going to cut them in big chunks so once all these are cut up I'm going to put them right in here and throw them in the fridge then first thing in the morning I'm going to meet you right back here and we're gonna start scoring everything take it out to the grill and it's going to just be amazing I can't wait I'm really excited all right all the vegetables are done look how beautiful that looks I don't know if you guys are familiar with the Red Robin salt seasoning so I'm going to be using some of that on this we're just going to just hit it real quick so we got some sort of flavor for the vegetables there's got to be like a pound and a half of chicken on each stick oh I'm know I'm going to screw this up I'm going to bust a stick in half but anyway it looks great doesn't it let's get these on the grill along with the vegetables all right go on outside I'll meet you right out there here's another cooking tip some people Pam will Pam there grill some people put oil on the grill here's one I learned take an onion put the end of a fork I got it is dip it in the oil and oil the grill that way pretty cool huh gives that nonstick surface all right so now that I know I'm not going to lose control this side I'm going to heat this side up and start getting the vegetables going well there you go grilling away on Jamaican Jerk shish kebab chicken and grilled veggies once again don't forget to keep your veggies separate because everything cooks differently meat and veggies don't cook the same I cannot explain to you how much I'm predicting this is nail'd these are perfectly grilled look at look at that just enough to soften them and give the tips a little darkness beautiful these are so plump there's juice running underneath them fully cooked oh absolutely perfect unbelievable ok let me show you something that I've never seen in chicken in all my cooking other than this recipe and it must be the marinade that I used it must be this chicken if you look it this piece just fell right off as I was sliding it off the off the stick and it didn't separate like chicken it separated like fish it is so tender it's falling apart like fish it's unbelievable like layers and it just comes apart like fish I can't even explain it you probably know what I'm talking about so that's what it looks like grilled vegetables grilled meat it's been marinating all night vegetables been seasoned let's give this a try take a look that look good awesome here we go the meat first all night marinating let's hope it's not too hot if I break out crying I'm going to be very embarrassed because so far everything went perfect mmm you know it falls apart in your mouth like fish oh a little hot no absolutely perfect exactly perfect no life the heat comes up right about there and stays there I can handle this heat this is one of my top recipes I have to tell you do me a favor share this on Facebook would you this is amazing especially for summertime and I'm so excited I'm gonna tell you just just to celebrate how excited I am I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing next week I'm making barbecue ribs next week I know I've done barbecue ribs but I'm
