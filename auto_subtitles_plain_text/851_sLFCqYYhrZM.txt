 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to share with you my recipe for a classic Caesar salad now I some of you might know I used to work with my dad in a restaurant for a very very long time and we always made our own dressing and the Caesar salad was one of the most popular salads and the dressing was probably the reason for that so let's take let me take you over two ingredients so you can get started you're gonna need some fresh romaine lettuce that I've washed dried and chopped some stale bread preferably Italian bread that I just chopped into cubes or bite-size pieces freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano some where's your sauce you're getting some garlic little anchovy paste Dijon mustard fresh lemon juice salt pepper and good quality extra virgin olive oil now in the restaurant we decided to when we came up with the Caesar salad dressing recipe we've made a decision that we were not going to be putting raw eggs in it now real traditional traditional Caesar salad dressing does have roe egg as an emulsifier just to kind of keep everything together we didn't want to do that because you're serving it to the public you know you don't know who has allergies or who just can't consume raw eggs so we thought we were going to just omit it and then add in a little Dijon mustard and that's the emulsifier that's what keeps it all together so great news no raw eggs in this recipe and the anchovy paste is completely optional you do kind of need it for a traditional Caesar dressing recipe you won't taste the anchovy but it just tastes like a salty background if you've eaten Caesar salad out somewhere I'm sure that it has an chilies in it so if you'd like that then chances are you like this recipe okay first thing you wanna do is get your oven preheated to 400 because we're gonna get our croutons in there because it kind of takes the longest to kind of come together what I have here is just some Italian bread that's I bought it yesterday so it's a little stale and I'm going to drizzle a little bit of olive oil on them and then just toss it into the olive oil just like so it's going to get flavor and help it brown and now I'm just going to put this into the oven and let them cook or bake for about 10 minutes until they're lightly golden brown and crispy now while the croutons are bakin away we're going to make the dressing I like to make mine in a just a big glass jar like this but it's easy you can do this in a little Bowl obviously in here I'm going to put in my anchovy paste in my Dijon mustard okeydoke and then we're going to put in the wash is your sauce fresh lemon juice and then for the garlic you can either mince it really really finely or you can just use a grater to grate it so that you know it's super super fine because you don't want to bite down yeah we don't want that you don't want to be able to bite down on a big piece it keeps going in there I don't know why but I'm just going to keep getting it until there we go you're mine now I win okay get it off the back and now I'm going to my little Halfmoon whisk and I'm going to whisk this all together so I want to make sure that the garlic and the Dijon mustard and the anchovy is well mixed and now while whisking I'm going to drizzle in some good quality extra virgin olive oil now looks great like that but now for this we're going to add in our freshly grated parmigiano Reggiano I grade it ahead of time just to save on time now I think this is most common for a Caesar dressing but I do know that some places have like a Mayo based Caesar dressing I personally don't care for that that's why I make my own so this is how I like it I control what's in it and that's pretty much how I roll so now I don't to do is I want to taste it now I'm not seasoning it yet I'm going to taste it first perfect so I know how much I much salt to put in because the anchovy paste is of course salty and the cheese is salty so I don't want to go blindly into it and season it so I'll just give it a slight taste so good it is just delicious delicious dressing and you do not trust me I've said this before to you as if you've been cooking for me for a while you know that I do not care for wrong anchovies at all in fact you know this more traditionally used like anchovy fillets I use the anchovy paste because they're just no texture it's just smooth sailing and it just gives a salty but you don't taste any fish so now I'm just going to clean up get my croutons put the thing together and wait my croutons are ready if they don't leave more in the oven for I would say about 10 minutes oh yeah so excited this is one my favorites definitely one of my husband's favorite salads I'm not going to pour all the dressing on it because I personally don't like a salad when it's ground and dressing I like you when it's just coated lightly mmm if you want to you can put some more cheese on top I know I will but just not just yet I want to give this a good toss and then give it a taste I'm excited I'm 1/3 watering I will do that let me eat a little bit for now I'm just gonna give it a taste I need I want that piece right there okay this is gonna be a mouthful hmm wow it's so good and when you make it let's see why everybody always loves it not fishy not overpowering it's just perfect tap it with some grilled chicken and you have the best grilled chicken Caesar salad of life hmm I hope you've enjoyed my time with me give this recipe a try because once you do I guarantee you'll never buy the bottled stuff ever again it tastes ten times better took 30 seconds to put together and you're going to enjoy it and I promise you that to get this recipe and others with wwr in the kitchen com I'm going back for more and I see you
