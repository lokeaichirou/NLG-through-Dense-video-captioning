 hi welcome to the central cooking I'm Melissa and I'm gravy and today we're going to be showing you how to make an easy recipe for chicken parmesan you will need three small chicken breasts two to three small chicken breasts or one large one and then how much you're making one to two eggs I think this might require to have about a cup and a half of flour here so I'm judging the chicken and then over here we found about one teaspoon each of garlic powder and dried basil about 1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley and about 1/3 cup of parmesan grated then here we have about a cup of just in your normal store-bought breadcrumbs another cup of Asian style breadcrumbs called panko okay so now we're gonna cut the chicken this is just a partially defrosted chicken breast I like to keep it a little bit frozen so that it's not really slippery when I'm cutting it usually recipes will call for you pounding out chicken breasts with a mallet solo from their flat but I don't have a mallet so I just use my knife right now I'm just turning off the oil fat pieces and you find an area where the breast is nice and flat against the cutting board and then as I didn't have and I like butterflying the pork chop there you go make sure you salt and pepper both sides of your ticket and we're also gonna put our garlic powder and our Thai basil in this then we're gonna go over to our bread crumbs and take a little bit of them and spread them on the plate so that breaded chicken doesn't stick and we're just gonna mix our fresh parsley and about 2/3 to half of the parmesan okay so this is the order we're going to do this in we're going to take our chicken dredge it in the flour dip it in the egg and then coat it with the breadcrumbs and let it rest on the plate okay so by now after you see from the ticket and gotten all of your ingredients together the chicken should be pretty much defrosted and we're going to dredge it in the flour so it's nice and evenly coated and then into the egg mixture and looks like these are probably fall apart so I'm just going to break them up right now and I usually like to grab a handful of my breadcrumbs and then plop the chicken in there so the breadcrumbs can just go right over it and make sure you get these nice and folded that fresh parsley in there will crisp up and taste really good same with the parmesan and after you're done coating it nice and evenly we're getting ready to start frying but first we're gonna turn on the oven to 375 to 400 degrees and and on this hand and put the oil in this doesn't look like it's gonna be enough you want about a quarter-inch that all right so we've got all of our little tidbits out of the way so now it's time for a big one and we'll let them get nice and brown like you guys are and those two little ones are probably going to end up being our taste tester once you start to see it getting brown around the edges you know it's almost time to flip up like I said before you don't really want to cook them all the way through and their goal with the frying is just to give them a nice golden brown color okay so we're done frying and the oven is still preheating so what we're going to do is just get everything ready to go in the oven so I'm go to baking the bigger the better that way you have the room now these guys and then you just want a spoon a little bit of sauce right on top don't get it all over because then you'll just defeat the purpose of all that fine you left so put it right in the middle and spread it around all right now we're going to put our cheese on we've got a mixture of shredded mozzarella provolone Romano Asiago and Parmesan cheese ooh and we'll be generous with the teeth and you can also top this with a little bit of more fresh chopped parsley okay so the chicken sent in the oven for about seven minutes at 375 I'm gonna take it out cheese is nice and melty I'm going to sprinkle on a little bit of the remaining parmesan that we put in the breadcrumbs and since this is gonna be right on top it's gonna get nice and crispy in the oven a bit more fresh parsley was for some nice color on the top okay so it looks like that's done and there is your finished product we added a little salad to the side you can also put chicken parmesan on top of pasta a lot of people like to do that you
