 thanks to Allrecipes member kathleen burton for submitting this roasted garlic mashed potatoes recipe one member claims I'm never making regular mashed potatoes again and another member says this was absolutely wonderful I don't know why I don't make my mashed potatoes like this all the time we loved these let's begin this recipe by roasting the garlic preheat the oven to 350 degrees place the garlic on a sheet of aluminum foil drizzle the garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil then wrap it with the foil bake the garlic in the preheated oven for about an hour or until it's tender meanwhile peel 2 pounds of medium russet potatoes you can also use Yukon Gold potatoes if you'd like cut them into quarters put the potatoes into a large pot cover them with cold water by at least an inch and add a generous pinch of salt bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until they are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife about 15 minutes drain the potatoes transfer them to a large bowl add four tablespoons of softened butter 1/2 cup of heated milk so that it doesn't bring down the temperature of the potatoes and salt and ground black pepper to taste remove the garlic from the oven and unwrap it cut across the top of the head of garlic exposing the cloves squeeze the garlic cloves into the potatoes discarding the skins blend the potatoes with an electric mixer on low speed until they're mashed to the desired consistency serve the potatoes hot topped with butter and a sprinkling of salt and pepper if you happen to be a real garlic lover you may want to roast two heads of garlic for these mashed potatoes as several members have suggested
