 hey guys Cassey here I am really excited about the recipe I have to show you today it's a Korean dish called beating Bob and it's this great mixture of rice and tons of veggies and meat all mixed together with spicy red pepper paste and it is delicious now if you've seen some of my videos before you know that I'm currently learning Korean and actually one of my favorite things about Korea is its food it is a country full of amazing food and I just love and free bit of it so let's go in the kitchen and I'll show you how to make vegan Bob first things first prepare sushi rice or any kind of short grain rice according to package instructions let it cook while you work on the meat and veggies then Lee slice 3 medium steaks or buy it pre sliced if you can add 2 cloves finely chopped garlic 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce a splash of sesame oil and a medium pinch of dark brown sugar mix everything together and let it sit in the fridge while you prepare the veggies first thinly slice 6 ounces of shitake mushrooms then thinly slice three ounces of baby carrots cut a large zucchini into three parts sliced lengthwise I cut into matchsticks we'll be adding some baby spinach later but there's no need to cut it now to cook the meat heat about a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat add the meat and all the marinade as well cook stirring frequently until the meat is browned and cooked through then set the meat aside covered with foil and add the mushrooms to cook in the juices to the mushrooms add one tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce a splash of sesame oil and a pinch of dark brown sugar cook until browned and softened set aside to drain on paper towels and cover to keep warm next cook the carrots with 1/2 TSP salt a bit of sesame oil and a half tablespoon of honey again cook until softened and set aside on paper towels to drain off excess oil and keep them covered before we cook the zucchini I'm going to deglaze the pan to get rid of all those bark bits to do this you can use some kind of wine or soju like I'm using here turn off the heat and add a splash then use your spatula to loosen the burnt bits since these are just burnt and we don't want them to discolor the zucchini we'll just wipe the pan at the paper towel and add a bit of fresh oil now turn the heat back to medium-high and cook the zucchini with a 1/2 teaspoon salt until soft and set aside like the other veggies covered and on paper towels to drain now add 6 ounces baby spinach to the pan plus one tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce and 1 clove finely chopped garlic cook until the spinach is wilted but still green and then set aside on paper towels to drain finally for each person fry an egg sunny-side up with a pinch of salt before we assemble the beating bap be sure to grab some gochujang aka red pepper paste to add as well first put a layer of rice in the bottom of the bowl place the egg on top and surround with veggies and Gotha and done now you've got a big bull a beautiful beating bout now that our bebop is all done let's give it a try this is what I love about beating Bob with each bite you get all of those different flavors and they blend together and just taste amazing and so guys I hope you give this recipe a try for yourselves and also let me know if you like it and also if you have any other Korean recipes that you'd like to try let me know or if there's any other Korean recipes or dishes that you think I should try let me know too and um well I'm a little bit hungry so I'm gonna go back to eating this and I will see you guys later bye you
