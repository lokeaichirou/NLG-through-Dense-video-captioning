 hi I'm Holly food editor at my recipes calm dinner tonight we'll show you how to make a healthy and delicious supper in less than 45 minutes hi I'm Holly Granger food editor at my recipes calm dinner tonight is cooking light's Dijon croque monsieur this simple recipe takes the basic ham and cheese sandwich up to the next level so let's start combine mayonnaise and Dijon mustard the Dijon mustard gives the sandwich a spicy kick then add the spread to the bread to assemble the sandwiches top four pieces of bread with ham and then add Gruyere cheese this is a nutty cheese so it adds a lot of flavor to the sandwich and then sprinkle each sandwich with pepper and then just top with the bread to make the batter for the sandwiches combine egg substitute or just a beaten egg with milk and then dredge each sandwich in the egg wash it's kind of like making french toast then add it to the hot skillet and depending on the size of your skillet you may need to cook these in batches or if you have a griddle that works really well to let these cook for about three minutes on each side or until they're golden brown and the cheese has melted this sandwich is just perfect and I love how well gray our cheese melts I like to serve it as a brunch entree or a parent with something like hair covers green beans and a glass of wine for a fancier dinner I hope you enjoy the simple meal for your dinner tonight
