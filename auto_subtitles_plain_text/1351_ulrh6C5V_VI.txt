 do you like my pot-au-feu let me show you how my wife made it with just four ingredients tofu pork chili bean sauce and garlic first thing you want to do is get the garlic ready give these a chopper or a knife to mince it up next take soft tofu or in our case silken tofu and cut it up into small cubes alright now let's put it all together so heat up your pan add some oil we're just going to spread the oil around and then we're going to throw in the minced garlic shortly after that we're going to add in the chili bean sauce and then we're throw in the ground pork or whatever meat you want or if you want it to be vegetarian don't use any meat at all here's the chili bean sauce we put in the tablespoon you don't need any salt with this dish because this this sauce is already salty on its own once the mean is just about cooked you want to throw in the tofu as well give it a gentle toss and then add about a cup of water into it to serve as the sauce for your dish all right now it's time to thicken up the sauce so prepare a slurry which is Quin starch and water mixture and throw it in the pan and just gently toss it again until it thickens after that you can add some scallions if you'd like and a little bit of sesame oil and then you're done one final tip by happy you guys is this dish is spicy so it's best for adults and may not be appropriate for younger children so instead of using the chili bean sauce a good alternative would be black bean sauce which is also kind of salty by itself but it's also very flavorful as well alright thanks for watching and please subscribe if you like it you
