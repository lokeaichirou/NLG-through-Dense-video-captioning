 I believe it's summertime so I'm gonna make some hot diggety corndogs what we'll need is a package of hot dogs and you can use any kind of hot dogs that you like you can use all beef I'm just gonna use the regular hot dogs cuz there there are only 99 cents what we'll need to do is open this package up and then place the hot dogs into the microwave and I'm going to use my defrost button on my microwave and defrost these for four minutes because I want to bring them to room temperature while my hot guys are in the microwave I'm going to make some homemade buttermilk and to do that you'll need some milk and some apple cider vinegar comes in a bottle like this then just take the apple cider vinegar and pour it into the milk take a spoon I'll stir it and that's it we're gonna let it sit for five minutes and then we'll have some soured milk here are all the ingredients that you'll need to make the corn dog batter we have some all-purpose flour yellow cornmeal salt baking powder baking soda and sugar and all of these ingredients can be purchased at your local 99-cent store for $0.99 except for the yellow cornmeal I had purchased this that stated brothers and I believe it was about five dollars so let's go ahead and place all of these ingredients into this bowl here start out with the flour and then the yellow cornmeal salt baking powder baking soda and the sugar and I'll have all the measurements for these ingredients listed in the description box below add this whisk to combine everything everything should be well incorporated okay and then let's go ahead and set this aside the buttermilk has been sitting for five minutes so let's go ahead and add the egg and we'll whisk that now that the two have been combined let's add the wet ingredients into the dry pour this right in and again we're going to whisk to combine everything just whisk until it's smooth what's everything is well combined set the better aside and let it rest for 30 minutes next you'll want to take a piece of paper towel and dry your hot dogs it's just walks in there back on the plate yo little fella there you go you'll want to dry the other side as well so flip them over it flip flip Pat them dry back then we're going to roll them in some cornstarch and that would help the batter stay on the dogs and when we find them so place a handful of cornstarch on your cutting board or cutting mat which is what I'm using and I also have some skewers here you see this is the regular length of the skewer but I went ahead and broken off about about two inches from the bottom to make them a little bit shorter because if I was to leave the skewer at its full length I won't be able to cook my corndog in my wok it won't fit so I went ahead and just snapped off the bottom two inches of the skewer and then we are going to insert the skewer into the center of the hotdog and it doesn't look like this now place the skewers into the center of the hotdogs now I'm just gonna take one and roll it into the cornstarch just want to lightly coat it this is gonna spread it out here and then shake off any of the excess flour give it a light coating that's all it needs the hotdogs are nicely coated with the cornstarch and I'm also going to heat up the oil in my wok so I have turned the heat to medium-high and here I have a tall glass which has a plastic baggie in it and we're going to pour the batter right inside so go ahead and spoon some of the batter right into the tall glass and we're gonna fill it to the top like this if you'd like to know when your oil is ready all you have to do is take a wooden skewer and stick it right into the oil once you see some bubbles form around it then it's ready to go okay the oil should be hot let's go ahead and take a hot dog we're gonna dunk it into the batter slowly all the way down so it's completely covered and it's squeezed a little bit up from the top that's why I have a baggy in there so that I can quickly cover the hotdogs with the batter it just makes it live it easier and ask you to take it out just kind of throw it around like that slowly just take it out of the batter like this there we are beautiful let's go ahead and immediately place it into the oil hold it for three seconds and then let it go gently like that and it's at the bottom of the wok right now but you can see it's gonna slowly float to the top and it's going to spin itself around a little bit and just leave it there for a little while after that you'll want to rotate your corndogs so that it can Brown evenly see it's gonna spin by itself so you don't have to do anything it should take three the minutes depending on your heat check on it there okay see it's kind of round on the bun so go ahead and turn it over so they can brown the other side as well it's beautiful it's a beautiful corn dog look at that I'm just gonna hold it here because the bottom needs to be browned a little bit alright see beautifully golden brown perfect and nice and let go of it and check on it once it's nice and golden brown like this go ahead and remove it from we have ourselves and gorgeous looking for dog right here let's take it out paste it on a paper towel to drain and I got to them so far let's go make some more one more time just take your hot dog and dunk it into the batter slowly insert it okay as far as it can go and then take your bag and squeeze live it on the top here completely cover it like that all right now remove it from the batter and immediately place it into the oil again hold it for three seconds one two three and then little bit gently there we are you can see it leaking on the bottom oil at the seat in and now it's just floated up to the top and just let it do its thing for a little bit here leave it alone just kind of turn it here what's a while just rotate your lug check on it see not sprouting on the bottom there I'm gonna hold onto it this time so I can brown on the bottom there we go and then turn it over one more time and let go of it there we are let's check on it make sure that doesn't burn here okay it's evenly Brown I'm gonna hold him right there let him around for 30 seconds and we'll shake him out there we go you let me take this guy out he's all done place it next to the other guy check that out some beautiful corn dogs alright so I got a few more to go I'm gonna keep the process until they aren't
