 hello everyone today we're gonna learn how to make hiyashi chuka ramen this is chilled Chinese ramen and this stuff is awesome this really is an awesome summertime dish so the first thing we're doing is we're taking a cucumber and we cut it in a little bit less than half and then we're gonna cut it in very very thin slices and as I mentioned this is such a refreshing summertime food especially when it's really hot out this is wildly popular in Japan and I you see there's so much in the summertime it is just excellent so definitely if you haven't had it before now is the time to try to have it because it is it is excellent so here what we're doing is we're taking those very thin cucumber slices and cutting them into very thin strips as well you know this is eventually going to be on top of our ramen noodles and so we wanted to try to cut it as cleanly as possible even though the cucumber does get a little bit slippery and it can be difficult but that's what we're going for really really thin cucumber slices like so and once we have that that should be good enough the next step is we're gonna cut up a tomato definitely gonna cut the end off first and then go ahead slice it in half and we're just gonna make wedges here very very well I just slide we're gonna make thin slices I take that back but the thin slices once again there's gonna be another condiment on top of our ramen noodles and really really with the cucumber and the tomato and the other things are gonna put on top just a nice chilled refreshing lunch or dinner so once we have our tomato the next step is we're gonna take a deli sliced ham go ahead and cut that in half fold it over and then we're going to take these hand pieces and just cut them into very very thin slices like so and once we do that we will be just about done with our condiments but uh it is worth noting this ham doesn't need to be super special there's a very standard Japanese ham slices we get but really any ham slices will do whatsoever so this is what the chicken ramen looks like and just look for the ramen package that looks like it has a bunch of cold stuff on top of it that's what you're looking for now we have boiling water and we're gonna take the ramen noodles and put it on top and really you just kind of mix it around ramen noodles definitely read the package but typically especially for the chilled ones these aren't like the you know the hard dried ones these only take about two minutes three minutes max now we're going to go ahead and mix them in with very cold water like so and how we lost our big bowl for the day I think someone borrowed it so we're doing in the salad bowl and a strainer like so but you just have really really cold water in there and you just mix it around and just keep mixing and mixing and mixing this will give you your chilled noodles like you're looking for and once we have our noodles chilled we take it out shake it around and put it on a plate now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take our chilled ingredients and put it around on top of the noodles like so you'll see we have the cucumber we have the ham slices and we actually went ahead and scrambled an egg as well and cut it into thin slices too and we go ahead and put the tomato not quite wedges on it as well and that's what we want to look like then we're going to take the sauce mix that comes with the ramen noodles and just pour it all over on top and there you go and the sauce is delicious too and that's what it looks like this is the hiyashi chuka ramen and it is fabulous thank you for watching we appreciate it like some comments please remember to subscribe thank you
