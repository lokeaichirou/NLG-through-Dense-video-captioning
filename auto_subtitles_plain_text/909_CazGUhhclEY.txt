 I a Miss Emily Lobeck I'm Dave's daughter and I'm going to teach you how to make a great blue cheese spread to put on top of hamburgers and we're grilling hamburgers tonight so all you need is walnuts you need to chop those you need some blue cheese some cream cheese a little bit of cognac and some onions that we're gonna grate in there so I'm gonna start by crushing these up with a rolling pin little trick that my dad taught me right there so I'm gonna take this cream cheese in here put it in the milk it's one whole package I'm gonna stir that a little bit I've stirred this up a little bit to make it a little softer to get it ready for the blue cheese and I'm going to put a half a package of blue cheese in there all right that looks good and then you're adding need to add your walnuts and it calls for a half a tablespoon of cognac I'm just going to eyeball it you were right fine all right it's not like rocket well it is kinda like rocket fuel yeah it is it's pretty strong all right great about a teaspoon of onion into here we're going to put some cracked pepper and salt in here just a little bit to taste this is kosher salt that were using it doesn't matter what kind of salt you use really though mix it up and then we'll have a taste test here soon all right that looks about good this is gonna be so good on a burger I cannot wait for dinner all right this is kind of grilling 101 but it's one of the biggest mistakes I see grillers encounter is when they make a hamburger because it usually ends up shrinking a meatball instead of being a good hamburger so let me show you something first of all the quality of the beef is very important this is from a local butcher while the product is local in it's an 80/20 leanness so there's 20% fat 80% meat you don't want anything more lean than that because then it won't hold together when you're grilling it and it won't have much flavor and since this is really good be from we're gonna have a really nice blue cheese spread on it we're just gonna salt and pepper these we're not going to get fancy with any kind of rubber or anything so anyway you take the animal burger about the size of a baseball you don't want to pack it too tight you want have to still a little have a little looseness to it but you just flatten it out this one's a little bigger mother too and then confront put on a wax paper it's really important to to let these come to room temperature which will make some cuts better if you'll notice I'm kind of hollowing out something in the middle or the area in the middle where it's thinner than the outside portion of the burger and the reason is when you grill that it has a tendency to pull together so if you've already this thin you'll come out with an even burner instead of a big meatball so that's just a little secret for how you do it then you just hit it with a little salt a little salt a little pepper gorilla try to turn it just two or three times want to get it medium meeting I like a medium rare but with ground beef medium so that's how you do the perfect burger we'll be back to show you what the blue cheese spread looks like where it's time to assemble the burger we're gonna put a thin layer of this spread on each bun what are these Bennett's we toasted about to give us some texture and that's just healthier all right and then we sauteed up some mushrooms top of one of the Bennett's all right take a look at this burger if you'll notice it did not bunch up into a ball and that was because of what we did which was create that hollow or thinner Center kind of add some lettuce to this one all right and top it off it's ready to go
