 getting to folks it's glinting the ball shelf in this evening we're going to be putting together a appetizer recipe for calamari this is just a fried squid ringlets it's pretty easy to put together and I'm going to show you the step-by-step instructions on how to do just such if you're going to make calamari what you're going to need to do is get fresh squid wild-caught don't buy the ring let's go ahead and get the squid take the tentacles off remove the little spiny piece of cartilage that's inside the squid and remove all of the innards and I've done that with you squid try to get the smallest squids possible because they are the tasty so what we're going to do is after you clean these these pieces of squid out you're just going to cut these in the in to end of ringlets it's real simple and one thing to keep in mind is that you're going to want to cut these into about half inch slices I'm going to go ahead and prepare all these pieces of squid I've got and I'll take you to the next step I have now cleaned all of my squid up cut it up and I've got it on a paper towel drying out I have taken three quarters of a cup of just all-purpose flour and a quarter cup of cornmeal I'm going to add one egg to that then we're going to place 3/4 of a cup of warm water into this mixture now I'm going to stir this up into a batter and when I've done such I'll come back and show you the next step okay now that I have prepared my batter it's going to be pretty liquidy that's okay we're going to put all of the squid into the batter first and once we have the squid immersed into the unseasoned batter give it a little bit of a stir and we'll set that aside and I'll show you the next step the next step in this battering process is we're going to put in one cup of panko breadcrumbs these are Japanese breadcrumbs that are nice light and fluffy put that right into this bowl and to that I'm going to add one and a quarter tablespoon of cayenne pepper I want the spicy if you don't like spicy don't put the cayenne pepper in there we're going to add some salt just about a teaspoon or so the paint coat flakes that I've got do not have any salt in them so we do want to put a little bit of salt in there and the last spice we're going to use is I want to use about a teaspoon of white pepper now what we simply want to do now is thoroughly mix the dry ingredients together and then once that's accomplished we're going to red up our squid now what we're going to do is we're going to spider out our squid from the batter that they were sitting in and then we're going to mix those in with the panko bread crumbs to thoroughly coat the calamari and what we're going to want to do then remove those and set those onto a paper towel and REE batch the rest now our next step is we're going to take and put our panko infused calamari into a basket here we're going to shake that a little bit take off some of the extra breading and then what we've done here is we've taken a deep fat fryer we've put in some vegetable oil that we bought up to 350 degrees we're going to drop our calamari right into the hot oil you put the top on this so that it doesn't splatter over everything and in about five minutes we'll come back giggling alright these are fried up nice and golden-brown go ahead remove them from the oil and we will put them right over onto a piece of paper towel alright folks there is the completed calamari appetizer recipe let's give one of these little critters a try here I've got some marinara sauce you can dip it in that go with the lemon I just wanted to see what one of these tastes like I'm not sure Al's very very tender juicy don't go with those large pieces of squid they're very rubbery this is a very nice dish for an appetizer for your seafood lover and you need to give this one a try thanks for watching me put together this recipe this evening give me a like if you like what you see if you don't tell me why thanks for watching again and as always Bon Appetit
