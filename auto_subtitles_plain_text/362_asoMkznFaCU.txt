 hi chef Roger we're about to make some compound butter this was going to be seasoned with garlic parsley salt and pepper that's it the measurement to be exact 110 gram of butter 2 cloves of garlic 1 tablespoon of parsley has been chopped same with the garlic you chopped it some salt and pepper you use columbaria to season your food for example if you're making a great steak and you don't want to put any sauce with it but just a nice piece of butter on top of it you could season that better with different ingredient and then those flavor when this passed on to your heart steak it could be a piece of fish to a piece of poor chicken instead quick to make easy to stop and usually it released a lot of flavor again to them a flavor we're using into it yeah you can pass it so to make it you take some butter and you cube it and then you will add your chopped ingredient to it here's my parsley here's my garlic I'm gonna season a little bit of slope touch of salt and some fresh ground pepper then I'm going to take my spoon and I'm going to mix everything together we might spoon this way nicely he's gonna stop it up and everything is gonna make mix well together then I will shape it as a lord so I can slice nice your slices after all of it so much that actually I'm gonna use that compound butter me to make some snails here are some beautiful snails and I'm going to tuck those snails with some of that butter and then put it in the oven and I'm gonna leave a feast out of that that's dinner tonight okay everything is mixed well see now I need to shape it to do that I'm going to take a piece of parchment paper but I have you I'm going to put the garlic right here on top of it going to fold the bottom and paper over it and then with my hand I'm gonna press it this way I'm pressing it like that see create a lot you could use our soul and it stands it like this one which is a pastry scraper and you just press it like that nicely and this is your compound butter here has been pressed now I'm going to put that in my fridge for a good thirty minutes I will say EB out and I could slice it and use it again onto my grill proteins oh here for some snails you could make a very nice cream sauce with that - if you were to simmer a little bit of chicken stock add a little bit of that to it and finish it with some cream it be beautiful not saying is the most healthy sauce but it's pretty good thank you for watching how to make a nice comment below and let me know if you like it bye
