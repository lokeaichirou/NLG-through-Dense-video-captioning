 I'm gonna show you how to make spicy tuna roll I have here bamboo mat wrapped in some wraps and a half sushi nori and I'm gonna wet my hand first the DC is a sushi rice we already cooked and a season and a cold we're gonna put in there on the seaweed and spread onto seaweed you want to cover seaweed with rice all over no no peeking and then you don't want to be too thick layer with the rice kind of one lay of the rice and then you want to be even spread evenly and many times people do is you just cover the seaweed with rice on the center part of it just the center and that's not going to work you want to cover with the side top and the bottom also then here I have sesame seed just sprinkle this is going to be inside out roll so I'm gonna flip over now I have tuna so you wanna feel the tuna in the center of the seaweed about total like half inch square and all the way end-to-end now if we want to put the spicy sauce here you can put it now but I don't do too much inside because when you roll it's gonna get back woozy out so just a little bit here then now I'm gonna roll pick up your bamboo with your thumb and with other fingers hold ingredients and let the will come in here and make a tighter pickup roll and a shape so that's your sushi oh I'm trying to make the shape of the roll kind of square how you depends on how you want to defeat some chef wanna be like a little round on the top and square on the side it's up to you by you the only thing you don't wanna do is flat associate so now I'm gonna cut the roll with your knife with damp towels and I'm gonna cut the roll in half first hold the roll on the side with your hand and you let the knife ago and cut it quickly and if you get the little gooey stuff you want to clean it up otherwise it's gonna get sticky and come in here I'm gonna cut in half again cut the half again and cut the half again so here I have plates what else you can do is you can add more spicy sauce on the top that's how you make your spicy to narrow
