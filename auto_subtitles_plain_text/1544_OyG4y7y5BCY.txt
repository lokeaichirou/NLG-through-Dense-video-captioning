 listen hamburger isn't just born as a massive meat and a plastic container you can walk up to the butcher and say that dry-aged rib eye steak that's mine I'm gonna grind that up into my burger you're in total control the signature burger of Minneapolis - cheese burger where the cheese is in the center of the butter its molecular gastronomy at its finest ladies and gentlemen the Juicy Lucy as there's so much more to a great burger than just buying pre-made patties at the supermarket right where you're just looking for maybe lean the fat ratio it's about picking different cuts of meat to achieve different flavors and that's how we're gonna really make this our own burger for this burger we have some short rib which is fatty and lean it's got a great mouth feel it's really luscious so this is a dry-aged rib eye steak it's what everyone who knows how to order steak orders at a steak house and we just trim the fat off of it we're going to grind that up and we have also Chuck and Chuck that cut that it's inexpensive but it's what everyone thinks of when they need a burger so we have this dry aged funk from this ribeye steak we have this luscious short rib now we have the Chuck which is no you with that so real men grind their own meat and there's something sort of carnal about throwing meat through a grinder so now we have our meat ground we have our Chuck our short rib and our dry-aged rib eye fat in here now we're gonna get making our high so we're going to form two patties all right so the bottom layer here we're going to throw into the can so juicy Lucy's actually from Minneapolis neat thing about it all the restaurants do it out there the cheese is in the middle of the cheeseburger now we're going to form our second patty make the other side of this ravioli this is our Juicy Lucy we have the short rib the chuck the dry-aged rib eye and then hidden inside of all of this meaty deliciousness is the white melted American cheese will will be melted once you cook it and that's we're gonna do the technique that we're going to use for cooking this burger same technique you would use if you were cooking a big steak and we're going to add a little bit of oil or fat to our pan in this case it's a little bit of duck fat duck fat is also a crucial ingredient in my hair recipe which is equal parts nature didn't duck fat like that we want to get a nice sear on this okay it's called the my yard reaction what making walk by a real and go oh my god that's not so delicious one of the mistakes people make again whether they're cooking fish burgers steak whatever it is we want to mess around with it too much and we're just going to let it cook and do its thing so now we're getting ready to flip our burger I wanna be really careful looks nice and brown and now we want to add some aromatics we're going to add some other flavor to it thyme and rosemary smash up some garlic and just for good measure will throw in butter as well and just by them being in the pan their flavor is going to go into the burger now this is what's happening in the fancy three-star restaurant when you order a big steak or a piece of fish by basting it we're making sure that all that flavor gets into the burger and then it doesn't dry out one of the things about cooking the Juicy Lucy you want to be careful that you don't have a blowout that the cheese doesn't come out that's why we're cooking in a little gentler you know this is technique there's a lot that's going into this and all of a sudden this is fine-dining we're going to let our burger rest and hang out it's in it's sort of butter jacuzzi over there now we're going to get into our bun so this is brioche brioche is an egg and butter enriched bread I like to cut a little bit more towards the top of it because the burger is kind of heavy we're going to put a few condiments on there so this could be the difference between your bond and your burger falling apart or a burger that holds its integrity the last time now we're going to toast our bun in the same pan that we made the burger why not mop up all of this good delicious juices one more last time and now we're going to start plating I'm a purist I love ketchup one of my favorite condiments so now we're going to put our caramelized onions on top we've just taken some raw onions we've thrown it into a pot with a little bit of oil and we've just cooked it very very slow so it gets nice and dark so this is like pure unadulterated flavor I'm a big pickle fam again acidity really wakes up a dish that's looking delicious so this burgers got everything on it gushing with cheese the Juicy Lucy gushing cheese and sugar make this at home and tell me what you think in the comments don't screw up Valentine's Day this year surprise that special someone with the ultimate pleasure Nutella butter you'd have to be crazy to live off vending machine food unless it's coming from one of these five super machines the Greeks might not know how to balance a budget but they sure can make a sandwich click here and learn how to make a souvlaki Samy check out furious beat Chris Thompson and John from simply spoons as they and the gang get hurly-burly with some haggis subscribe for more free tasted treats
