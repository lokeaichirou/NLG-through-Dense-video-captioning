 hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make low-fat vegan hash browns so I've got these organic red potatoes and I've already shredded up a decent amount of them just to save time and i'll show you how I'm going to shut up this last one I have this tool it's called a master cut you pretty much just slop hold the potato here and you can see inside here just comes up with all these little shoe string type of shreds and it works pretty fast I'll figure this out and I don't know if you can buy this tool called the master cut online or what because it actually came with cookware that we bought like four or five years ago so I haven't tried looking or I don't know but otherwise a good tool is a cheese grater I read online that a course cheese grater can actually get these cut type of shreds out of potatoes so if you're vegan and you don't have a cheese grater that would probably make sense put them it borrows one out for someone or just buy one and use it so you can cargo box reddit potatoes every night so and this is three pounds i don't know if i told you or not three pounds of organic red potatoes and I've got my um ceramic nonstick pan right here and I'm not going to use any oil I don't recommend eating oil um too high it's just liquid fat it's not gonna do anything good for your body or your arteries so these are vegan hash browns don't use butter don't use oil if you have weird pans that maybe they're not nonstick maybe use it tiny bit in the bottom but just enough so that stuff doesn't stick and get all crazy or you could use a little bit of water too but I don't recommend adding any oil so I'm pouring all this in the pan and it might sound weird but this is all one meal I'm gonna eat this whole thing and i'll probably make another batch for my husband he's at work right now but yeah cuz we eat a lot alright set that there and I'm gonna show you i'm going up you can put herbs on it or spices if you if you really really need salt I mean put a little on but I don't really eat a lot of salt i eat a low sodium diet so i've got these parsley flakes dried parsley i'm going to shake a little of this on don't even make sense to still with the top off because not coming out very well so i got some dried parsley i'm sure you can do fresh partially to even better and um i'm gonna put a little bit of turmeric on i like it then it makes it with yellow and then some pepper cool and i'll show you i got it kind of on a lower setting for the stove here if you can see supra toot leg around three I don't know what you guys the stoves are looking life but yeah cook it on low and i'm going to stir all this around and cover it with this lid and i'm going to set a timer and after 15 minutes i'm going to flip it and wait another 15 minutes and see if it needs to be flipped again otherwise it should be done it and i'll show you the finished product okay so we're back with the final product this is what it looks like beautiful I like to eat it with a little ketchup if you're worried about sodium or any other anything else you got a problem with ketchup you can make your own sort of a sauce on any kind of tomato sauce pot low-sodium pasta sauce you can use hot sauce barbecue sauce or you can just eat it plain it's really tasty and I'm also going to eat it with some organic romaine lettuce leather wrap it up or just munch on it get the greens in and I know why I lied earlier i said i was going to be eating this all by myself actually I've got a little buddy helping me at 26 feet little buddy in here I'm pregnant helping me eat this so it's going to be delicious I eat this like almost every night don't worry potatoes aren't going to make you fat and you're gonna feel amazing I want to see all you get healthy eat your fruits and vegetables watermelon bananas potatoes or even rice I got some rice over here right dates your fruits and vegetables I want to see you get super healthy and go vegan you
