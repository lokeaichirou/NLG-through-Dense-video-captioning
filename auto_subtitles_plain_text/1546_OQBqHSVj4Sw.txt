 mushrooms tofu pot stickers a family favorite for sure hi it's Jayden from steamy kitchen calm I love the crispy outside of pot stickers just as much as I love the filling so I created these pot stickers so that one they're easy super super easy to fold and two they have maximum crispiness on the outside these are my vegetarian version with shiitake mushrooms tofu and cabbage what I love about pot stickers is that you can fold a hundred of them or even more if you want and freeze what you don't eat that day and it becomes a very very quick 15 minute meal because the dumplings can go from freezer to the pan straight away without defrosting okay here's the filling I chopped cabbage you can chop it with a knife like I did or you can use a big box shredder or you can use your Cuisinart add the tofu doesn't matter what kind of tofu you want you want to crumble or crumble the tofu if you want this is shiitake mushroom that I diced as well so just mix everything together I love lots of garlic so and ginger so I got a lot of that too the filling of fresh herbs so I'm adding fresh Thai basil that I'm just running my knife through to the filling and all of these aromatics into a small bowl and then pour in your soy sauce mix this together doing this in a small bowl first before adding it to the big bowl helps it just disperse evenly throughout all the vegetables here are two different brands of wrappers that I happen to pick up at the Asian market these come frozen and you have to defrost them they only take about 40 minutes on the counter to defrost or you can defrost them in the microwave but don't defrost them underwater because they'll get wet and soggy in usable brand on your right is twin marquis it's actually a little thicker than the other brand I actually prefer the brand on your left it's nice thin and very easy to fold okay these are defrosted and there you can see they're really thin and flexible they're perfect consistency for potstickers what holds a potsticker together is either an egg wash that you can make or just cornstarch and water which is what I use I like using point star chilled water it's just easier add a scant tablespoon ability don't overstuff them they'll burst paint around the edges of the skin and fold them in half and make sure that everything is that there's no air in the potstickers so push out the air and make sure that all the edges are sealed tightly seal tightly then they open up and then oil seeps in and the spilling falls out etc etc right here's another one don't add too much filling again and just fold it in half into a Halfmoon I squeeze the middle first and make sure that that seal and then seal the rest of the edges and make sure that there's no air air bubbles and then I go for one more time with with my fingers just to make sure that it's sealed correctly now for those of you who like to get a little bit more fancy here is the real way of holding pop stickers again fold them in the middle and make sure it's tight in the middle and clean one side towards the center just like this I did three picks on each side and make sure that that's sealed correctly now I'm going to go on the other side and I'm gonna pleat towards Center three on each side you can do two or three on each side doesn't matter and then I go over it one more time on the edge to make sure it's tight and now you can see it's like a nice cute little dumpling that has a that stands up and also can what am I saying I don't know here's a different angle I'm pleading towards the center and I'm only folding one side which gives a nice curve just like this go over it one more time with my fingers make sure it's super tight and that's it so you can fold them either way I like both the first way is much easier so if you've got kids or you want to do them super fast you can do it that way plus the first way gives you maximum exposure to Chris penis in a pan heat a pan non-stick pan with cooking oil and once it starts shimmering a bit go ahead and add the pot stickers and let them fry for a couple minutes until they are browned and not burn but just Brown turn them over you can see that nice crispy edge for me okay that's where the steaming part comes in you're gonna add just a couple tablespoons of water to the pan close it with a tight lid and let let the water steam and finish cooking the pasta curs after a few minutes they are done they're ready to serve the water has evaporated and just put them on a plate and serve them remember I said that you could freeze these and then go direct from freezer to the pan well you can do that once you take them out of the freezer you want to place them one by one in the pan with a little bit of oil and remember just be careful make sure that they don't overlap each other too much in the pan just add a couple of minutes to the given time full recipe or if you have any questions at all head over to steamy kitchen calm / 135 thanks for watching
