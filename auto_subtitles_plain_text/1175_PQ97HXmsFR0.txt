 hi everyone me and Randy are going to be cooking from my kitchen today and we're going to be making some fun and delicious food right gray yes so let's go ahead and get started all right now for the filling I am going to use pre cooked frozen jumbo shrimp and I am just going to soak it in cold water until they are defrosted and once the shrimp have defrosted we can go ahead and just strain them in a colander and once the shrimp are drained from the colander I'm just going to go ahead and take the tails off and then just chop them into rough pieces about a quarter of an inch thick like this and once the pieces are chopped we can go ahead and set them aside the first thing that we want to do is go ahead and peel all of the skin off using a peeler like this and once all of the skin is removed from your ginger you want to go ahead and grade it using a grater just like this and once your ginger is all graded you can go ahead and set it aside and what I want to do is first just cut about an inch I'll put the top of the greens like so and then I just want to cut off the root bases like that now what I want to do is I'm just going to cut them into about quarter inch pieces like this once the onions are cut then we can set them aside while we prepare our other ingredients now the other part of my filling is just going to be a broccoli slaw mix now this is broccoli carrots and red cabbage and it's already pre chopped and it makes it so much easier to make the filling for our spring rolls you now to the broccoli next I'm just going to add the peanut oil the grated ginger the green onions chopped garlic now this chopped garlic I actually buy in the grocery store pre-chopped it actually just saves a lot of time and preparing your foods but you can use fresh garlic if you wish just 2 teaspoons of that about a teaspoon of ground coriander now I'm using this Moroccan the coriander that I got I think I got this at world market but I just want to put about a teaspoon of that and then a teaspoon of five-spice powder now five-spice powder you can usually find at most oriental grocery stores and sometimes you might be able to find it in the ethnic section of your local grocery store so we just want a teaspoon of this as well then we want to add just a little bit of grated lime rind this is just the zest of the lime so again I'm just going to hold this grater over my bowl and just DES just a little bit of this grated lime into my broccoli slaw and the last thing that we want to add is some salt now I'm using this pink Himalayan salt that I've actually had gotten and I just want to add about 1/2 a teaspoon of that salt and now I'm just going to stir until everything is mixed up together and once the broccoli has microwaved for about one to two minutes and it's become soft just a little bit you just want to stir it around again just to mix up the ingredients and then we want to go ahead and add in the shrimp and then just start until the shrimp is combined into the mixture as well now to wrap our spring rolls I'm just going to add about three teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a little bit of water and this is just going to make a paste so that we can seal our spring rolls thoroughly I'm just going to use these um spring roll wrappers you can usually find them in the frozen section of most oriental grocery stores and place the wrappers on a plate and you just want to take a little bit of a mixture and kind of put it in the center but more towards you like this and you want to make sure to get some of the shrimp in with the broccoli and then what we want to do is we just want to fold this over and then bring the sides in now sometimes if you got a little bit too much of the mixture it will start to poke out just trying to push it back in then you want to go ahead and fold the sides in and make sure they're in there tightly because if there's any holes you will get spits and spatters when you go to fry them and then you just want to slowly roll up like this and then at the end you want to take some of that cornstarch mixture on your finger and just rub it lightly and then close it to seal and there's your finished roll and you can go ahead and place this on a baking sheet and what we're going to do after that is we're going to deep fry them you it was easy so once all the spring rolls are wrapped we can go ahead and heat about two cups of peanut oil on high and once the oil is hot about 350 degrees we can go ahead and add in our rolls and we just want to let them cook until they are brown and once they turn golden brown in color you can go ahead and remove them and place them on a plate lined with paper towels and once they are done cooking then they are ready to serve enjoy you
