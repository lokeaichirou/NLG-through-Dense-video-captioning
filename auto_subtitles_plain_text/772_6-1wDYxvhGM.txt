 hi everybody this is Diana from sweeties hello and today we're making carnitas tacos with a cilantro lime sauce now these carnitas are a little bit different because we're now gonna marinate them with a lot of ingredients we're just gonna roast them in the oven and bring out the natural flavor of the meat which is the way they make them add my favorite Mexican restaurant and trust me these are incredible as always the link for this recipe is gonna be available at the end of the video and in the infobox below first we're gonna make our cilantro lime sauce and for that we're gonna need some cilantro that we're gonna put in a food processor we're also gonna add some jalapeno garlic powder [Music] onion powder cumin some lime juice and we're also going to add some crema mexicana or Mexican table cream if you can't find this you can use just heavy whipping cream if you want and then we're gonna add a little bit of mayo we're gonna cover and then we're gonna process until smooth [Music] now we're going to season with a little bit of salt then we process again to make sure everything's well blended and then we're gonna store it in the fridge to make our carnitas we're going to need a pork shoulder roast this one still has the bone and all we have to do is trim off the fat if you don't want to trim off the fat that's okay because this is completely optional we're also going to remove the skin and when I remove the skin I also remove a little bit of meat just like this because I save it to make other Colombian recipes such as Colombian beans tamales and lentils [Music] the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna cut this pork shoulder in half because it's very thick right now we cut it right in the middle [Music] and we're also going to remove the bone [Music] now when I remove the bone I also like to leave a little bit of meat on the bone because I save it to make other recipes such as sancocho and pork stew then we're going to season our meat with a little bit of salt we're gonna put it in a roasting pan or a baking dish [Music] and then we add a little bit of water [Music] then we're gonna bake it at 375 degrees for about an hour and after an hour this is what they look like then we're going to turn them over and we're gonna bake them again at 450 degrees for about 30 minutes turning them over every five to eight minutes until they're golden brown on the outside once they're done we're gonna put them on a cutting board and then we're gonna shred them with a couple forks if you want you can use your hands but remember these are steaming hot so you have to be careful [Music] and now our carnitas are ready to warm up our corn tortillas we're going to place them on a hot pan and we're going to heat them up for about 10 seconds per side if you want you can add a little bit of oil and fry them in the oil [Music] and once they're done we're gonna put them on a plate and cover them with a towel or a paper towel to assemble our tacos all we have to do is put some carnitas on a corn tortilla then we're gonna add some cilantro you can add some white onion if you want we add a little bit of that cilantro lime sauce some hot sauce and avocado and lime wedges and that's how you make some carnitas tacos with a cilantro lime sauce if you enjoy this video in this recipe please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to this channel and to check out the recipe you can click on c√°rdenas tacos recipe don't forget that you can follow me on Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest and Google+ thanks everybody for watching and I hope to see you next time bye bye my bro H Oh [Music]
