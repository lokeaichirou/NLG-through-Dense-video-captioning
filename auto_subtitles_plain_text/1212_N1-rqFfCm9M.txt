 this is a real winter warmer my mum's wont on noodle soup for some variation you can choose to deep fry the wontons and add a bit of tomato sauce chop the coriander and spring onion then place in a bowl wash the two prawns under water and with a knife carefully slice the spine and take out the excess slice the prawns into small cubes then place in with the pork mix mix the egg whites add a little water add some flavor with a teaspoon of chicken powder 1 teaspoon of brown sugar and throw in one and a half teaspoons of potato starch with a pair of chopsticks mixed together thoroughly for a minute grab a single sheet of wonton skin using a spoon or chopsticks place a tablespoon of mince mix in the middle fold the skin in half bunch together at the center and twist slightly repeat until the mix is finished time for the chicken broth clean the chicken bones throw the bones in a pot of boiling water drain the boiling water and repeat process this will remove the excess oil and fat from the water then place a handful of dried shrimp which you can find at your local asian grocer and some crushed garlic into the broth for 30 minutes in a pot bring water to the boil and throw in the wontons as a handy tip squeeze the wonton casing so no meat leaks out once it comes to a boil a second time place some cold water in add the egg noodles into the same pot using chopsticks constantly move the noodles so it doesn't stick together drain the water and add cold water to keep the elements separated place the cooked egg noodles in a bowl one teaspoon of cooking oil one tablespoon of oyster sauce return to the chicken broth and add two teaspoons of chicken powder and a pinch of brown sugar and a tablespoon of fish sauce garnish with chopped spring onions and coriander sprinkle some fried shallots season with white pepper scoop the broth into the dish and there you have it mama trans wonton noodle soup tune in next time for more family recipes raw and straight from the source subscribe to julie tran on youtube and follow us on twitter for the latest updates you
