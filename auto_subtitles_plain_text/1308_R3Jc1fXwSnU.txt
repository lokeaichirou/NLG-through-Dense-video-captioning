 okay everybody it's be vegan and today's video is about probiotics and sauerkraut I just want to give you a little bit of background before I go into the recipe that I'm gonna share with you a couple years ago I was having issues with my digestive tract and I think actually what caused it is I was working somewhere where I was getting really sick all the time and so I had gone through a few courses of antibiotics and my stomach was just giving me so many problems and I knew a way to fix it naturally was through probiotics but I didn't want to use something that was full of animal product so I didn't want to use like a kefir or one of those expensive things that they sell in Whole Foods like in glass bottles its probiotic which is great but the majority that comes from milk also I believe that kombucha has great probiotic properties but I was out of town at the time and didn't have access to a kitchen so I was not wanting to spend 4 dollars every single day to buy a kombucha so this is something that I kind of through the years have gotten to like and really enjoy when I was in Poland I ate like sauerkraut daily if you look at my Instagram I think I was in love with sauerkraut I put so many pictures up but this is the recipe that we stumbled upon my husband and I he's polish so he introduced me to sauerkraut and then I realized after some time that there is actually probiotic properties in sauerkraut which is unbelievable so I'm going to show you how to make it but first let me just tell you a couple things that are beneficial to know about this vegan source of probiotic fermented vegetables are very rich in lactic acid and along with other natural acids that are produced in your digestive system those help break apart this sounds disgusting but like putrified food undigested food that becomes purified in your digestive tract so it really helps break that apart and flush it out cabbage and broccoli and other cruciferous cruciferous vegetables are really good for your system anyway they have a lot of fiber they're actually anti-can Souris and then when you when you combine the cabbage with the probiotic process that happens through fermentation you have these two things that just like BAM POW together and it really gives your digestive system are cleaning out as well as a flushing through to save for lack of a better term sauerkraut is something that I have been searching for here in the US trying to find something that compares to what I ate in Poland and anything jarred is like just pales in comparison so we wanted to make our own sauerkraut we wanted to find the recipe that was completely pure and so this is the recipe without further ado it has very little ingredients it's just a head of cabbage which if you can get organic cabbage where you live maybe it's three dollars something like that if you can't find an organic cabbage then it's gonna be even less than that and I use Himalayan salt with it and all you need is some kind of empty glass jar that's cleaned very very well and that has some kind of lid on it and honestly that is all unique the cabbage provides its own water over time and the process takes about five six days and it is so delicious it actually takes exactly like the cabbage that I've tried in Europe and it's fresh and it's raw and it's wonderful so here we go this is what you need to do to make this dark out in your home number one 2.2 pounds or one kilo of green cabbage thinly chopped I use the food processor you can use that if you have it it's not you can chop it by hand number two 1.5 tablespoons or 25 grams of good quality salt no table salt table salt it's so bad for you I could make a whole nother video on that I used to Malayan see I used Himalayan salt you can also use like Celtic sea salt and any of those are good good quality salts number three is optional I didn't add at this time but you've if you'd like to you can add two grated carrots number four gonna need two big pickle jars or any kind of glass jar that has a lid the jar that I used are 30 ounce jars each or what I think would be better although I'm yet to find a gigantic jar I think one jar at 60 ounces would be perfect for one whole head of cabbage here's what you need to do chop the cabbage in your food processor or by hand and then put it in a big bowl with the salt and leave it uncovered for an hour you want to just mix it together with your hands or with a spoon whatever so the salt gets everywhere after some time some water is just going to come out from the cabbage and so you leave it there for a full hour and then you mix it again after the hour and you transfer it equally between both jars even the jars once it's in the jars you wanted to have the top quarter of the jar empty so you're only going to fill two cabbage in the jar like three quarters of the way the reason for this is because it's going to rise liquid is going to come and it means that space for fermentation you're going to mash it down with something you can use any kind of spoon you have I happen to use a Vitamix gosh what the heck is that called I think it's called a tamper and that's what I use and then you place it somewhere at room temperature with the lid on but not screwed on tight you want it to be covered so that junk doesn't get in to it just from sitting around to all five six days but you don't want to close the lid because it'll stop the fermentation process and you don't want to put it in the fridge with the lid closed because that also will stop the fermentation process juster or not to stir that is the question some people believe stirring the sauerkraut daily is a good thing and mashing it down some people believe you should just let it sit and do its thing I kind of am in-between on those so if it looks like it needs a little stir I'll stir it and place the lid carefully back on other times I'll let it go a couple days without stirring at all then you wait for five or six days until it looks good and tasty and then you taste it and you see if it's good and if it's to your liking then you can screw the lid on and put in the fridge and if it's not to your liking you let it sit another day and it's really as simple as that and that's it this is the finished product it has completely filled it up it looks beautiful the green color that's on the outside the joiner has turned to a lovely white and kind of different shade of green and it's really good something I wanted to say that it didn't say earlier if some people use vinegar and sauerkraut and it's just not necessary it's I don't think it's a good thing for you to be ingesting all the time I've heard controversial things about vinegar so I tried to stay away from me except for cleaning my dishes but I don't use any vinegar it's just not necessary and it tastes amazing and do a little taste this actually faith for five days my mouth is watering cool mm-hmm very good okay try this recipe
