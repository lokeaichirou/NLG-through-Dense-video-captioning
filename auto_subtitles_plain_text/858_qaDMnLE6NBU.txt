 hi guys it's all in this video I'm going to show you guys how to make homemade fresh spring roll it has been a highly requested video over on my youtube channel so I'm finally getting around to doing that for you guys and it's very easy to make it's healthy they're delicious although it's usually served as an appetizer at restaurants I like to eat it as a dinner I'll have like 5 or 6 of them in one sitting and I'm stuffed no you don't feel like a complete cow after you eat ok I like to use now tofu Vietnamese ham and also shrimp in mine I used to use pork belly in my spring rolls but of course that's kind of fatty so I started omitting that all together so instead I've replaced pork belly with tofu I used to really hate tofu I used to be really confused when eating it and I just be like ok take a bite ok tofu like what is it what are you are you like an egg are you like meat because you're really the texture of you or you're kind of confusing so yeah so yeah it's really easy to make really healthy filled with lots of fresh herbs but I hope you guys enjoy the video don't forget to check out my other tutorial for my homemade Vietnamese ham first I'm going to show you guys how to make the dipping sauces I added my hoisin sauce and peanut butter into a food processor and I'm just going to pulse this all the while I'm also adding in my sugar water just a little bit of sugar with some water just to smooth it out along with a little bit of garlic powder and just puree until smooth taste check it make sure it's yummy it's all to taste really it is and then dump it into something with the lid I like to use mason jars for this and now I know it seems a little bit running to you but it's the perfect consistency for me it should be slightly thinned out but thick enough to where you should take your figure into the onto the back of the spoon and it should all just stay and hold its shape except this aside and I'll show you how to make the sweet and sour fish sauce into my measuring cup I'm adding in some sugar along with some very hot water and you just want to stir this until all the sugar has dissolved and then add in your fish sauce mix well then you want to squeeze in some lime I know you're going to ask can I use vinegar the answer is yes I don't know how much I usually use one lime maybe a little bit more depending on how juicy it is add in some chopped garlic stir and then taste check use my measurements as a guideline everyone has different tastes and then once it's to your liking go ahead and add in your chili peppers I'm using fresh chili here and if I had ground chili paste I would add some of that in as well but I don't have that but that's okay and just stir well and then again just put it into something with a lid this stores or it keeps in the fridge for quite some time put this aside and I will show you how to work on the spring rolls you will need some cooked of vermicelli noodles all the packages are different you might not have an angry looking Vietnamese woman on your cover like I do but make sure you follow the directions on whatever package you have I will also be using some tofu some bean sprouts some lettuce some sawtooth coriander which looks just like this and some mint and cilantro now for the shrimp I've boiled these already deveined with the shell on that's how you keep it nice and flat and then you just want to basically split it in half and then after that that's when you want to remove the shell and that's it it's easy-peasy and just continue with the rest of your shrimp and then just set them aside and for the tofu you just want to cut them in half and then cut each half into thirds and you want them to be just about this size and I also cut up my hand the same size as the tofu now for the rice paper today I'm using the three ladies brand you want to start off by taking one piece and completely submerging it into some very very warm water try to make it as even as possible don't keep it for too long a quick dip and then remove it tap off any excess water and place it on a clean wooden board that has not touched any meat or anything like that you want to make sure you're really safe and then just take your hand and smooth it out and then we're gonna start with the assembly so in the middle we're going to place some lettuce my sawtooth coriander some mint again all these veggies are nice and clean have been washed and dried in my salad spinner I'm also going to add in some cilantro and I forgot to add in my what do you call that bean sprouts but I do then the next one and then you want to add in your cooked rice vermicelli noodles and then I'm going to add on the side of my veggies I'm going to go ahead and add in my slices of homemade vietnamese ham and then my shrimp right next to it and then I'm going to layer my tofu right on top of the ham I did two pieces of ham two pieces of tofu well what do you know I guess I did remember to add in my bean sprouts I'm now I'm adding in my bean sprouts and then make sure you have enough rice paper to completely roll over your veggies and noodles once you've covered that part you want to give it another tight roll over and then you want to bring in the sides right before you start rolling up your shrimp now the reason you put the shrimp glass it's for presentation reasons you can really put in whenever you want it's just so that to make sure that the shrimp shows see it's nice and pretty and you're done so to show you one more time I'm adding again my cleaned lettuce right in the middle kind of I'm adding in my mint and there's no real order to this as long as you put the lettuce first and then the noodles last on top of all of your veggies and herbs I find that it's easier to roll and it keeps everything compact and nice and tight here I'm just adding in some more cilantro and now my fresh bean sprouts which I finally remembered and again like I said top it off with your noodles now for my second row again I'm adding in my homemade ham along with some tofu two of each and for the final row I'm going to add in three pieces of shrimp and then again continue to roll just like I said before up and over over your herbs and your veggies get it nice and tight and then right after you've rolled over your ham and your tofu you want to bring in the sides and then just continue to roll over your shrimp and you're good to go if you guys make some tonight don't forget to check out my other video for my homemade vietnamese ham click on the picture above thanks for watching
