 Salam alaikum and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan if you're going to do a Middle Eastern feast then one thing that definitely has to be on there it's the salad called tabbouleh to make this tabbouleh I've got one very large bunch of fresh parsley a smaller bunch of fresh mint here I've got three spring onions you can use these or a small white onion a small piece of cucumber a tomato 50 grams have dried a bulgur wheat one lemon and three to four tablespoons of olive oil put the bulgur wheat in a bowl and add enough boiling water to just about cover the wheat now put this to one side for 10 minutes meanwhile you can chop the parsley quite fine when you've chopped it nice and fine pop it into a bowl now pick the leaves off the mint stalks then chop them nice and fine and add them in with the parsley now take the cucumber cut it down the middle and scoop the seeds out with a teaspoon throw the seeds away and chop the cucumber flesh reasonably finely and add to the bowl now cut the tomato into quarters scoop out the seeds with a spoon then chop the flesh quite finely and add to the bowl then finely finely chop the onion and add it into the bowl as well and a little pepper a couple of pinches of allspice and a pinch of cinnamon then mix together now train the bulgur and squeeze it dry before adding it into the rest of the salad very mix thoroughly when it's thoroughly mixed put it in the fridge for about an hour to chill when you're ready to serve drizzle over the juice of the lemon and the olive oil delicious tabbouleh it goes great with or just about anything really the problem with two bullies that are served in the West is they have far too much bulgur wheat in them but this recipe is more like the traditional German next time in titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan until next time what happens
