 hi guys today on Davidson cook I'm gonna show you how to make one of my favorite kind of mashed potatoes cream cheese mashed potatoes oh my god they are so good nice and thick yet fluffy and light so let's get started okay we're gonna start by washing and scrubbing our potatoes it's really good I get kind of OCD with cleaning potatoes it never feel clean to me you know I'm saying I hate that feeling next you're gonna go ahead and peel them and I'm using russet potatoes because russets are the best for mashed potatoes okay forget what your hurt russet are the bomb potatoes are big green but that's okay they were still good in my book okay next we're gonna slice our potatoes lengthwise into even sized strips okay not cubes this time we're gonna use nice even size strips like that perfect place them into a pot and they're gonna cover them with chicken broth instead of salted water we're gonna use chicken broth it's gonna add a lot of flavor and it won't taste like chicken I promise okay don't forget you guys you can find this recipe on my blog diva's calm with a ton of the recipe so going over there and check it out and here's the broth that I use you guys it's called better than bullion I love this stuff it's like a paste and then you just add water to it love it okay we're gonna place our potatoes on the I bring it to a bowl and we're gonna reduce the heat and simmer them for about 30 minutes until they are super super super soft just like that okay and fork or a knife should glide through like a hot comb through fresh snaps okay it should be so soft and it's totally okay to overcook these potatoes you don't want to undercook them at all go ahead and drain them in a colander and then we're gonna return them back to that hot pot and then place them right back on the eye and let them steam for a bit to get rid of some of that extra water because water and mashed potatoes are not besties honey they do not get along so you don't want that in your mashed potatoes now we're going to go ahead and mash them up once mash mash each potato I can't even talk mash each potato up once and then stop you gotta know when to put that masher down I know it's fun but we want thick mashed potatoes not gluey okay and the more you work it the gooey or it becomes alright so know when to stop next we're gonna add in some chopped up butter that I've chopped up nice and cute and little so that they melt really quickly and you can use a rubber spatula kinda you know toss it around a bit very gently next I'm gonna add in some pops-up cream cheese okay go ahead and throw that in there I'm gonna toss this around very gently and then we're going to go ahead and add in enough half-and-half to get the texture that I like okay so go ahead add your half-and-half in there and mash it up a little bit use your spatula to kind of stir it up a little bit but not too much okay not too much all right then you can add in some salt and pepper I didn't add in anything I thought it was perfectly seasoned and here is the texture that I like I don't like mashed potatoes that are like baby for lucky I can't do that from the south we like things thick and chunky like our booties okay this is perfect I'm gonna add in a little bit of butter because I already have a muffin top so why not all right that's perfect in there we have it nice fluffy thick mashed potatoes stick-to-your-ribs type mashed potatoes goes great with some gravy and some bacon cheese whatever these are perfect and they are so flavorful I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe thank you so much for watching bye guys
