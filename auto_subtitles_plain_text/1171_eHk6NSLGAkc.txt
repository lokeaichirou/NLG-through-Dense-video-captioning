 hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with minestrone soup that's right the classic italian soup roughly translates to a big soup and that's exactly what this is big flavors big everything and by the way i've never made this the same way twice and neither should you so this time i started off with a handful of chopped pancetta they call it Italian bacon but it's not smoked I'm gonna saute that over medium heat a little bit of olive oil until not quite browned almost when it just starts to look like it's gonna Brown throw in your onions alright I'm also going to dump in diced celery and I'm going to cook those vegetables for about four minutes until the onions just start to turn translucent and by the way I didn't drop a black olive into my pot there's a little chip in the bottom of my Dutch oven don't be alarmed at that point I'm going to add some minced garlic a good amount I think I have like four cloves worth all right we don't want to brown that of course so stir that in and just cook that for about a minute all right after the garlic cooks for about a minute we're going to dump in our chicken broth and some water and one can of plum tomatoes that I crushed with my fingers you could also use of course crushed tomatoes diced tomatoes anything you want alright give that a stir we're going to bring that up to a simmer while we prep our beans now you can just use all canned beans for this but I had these beautiful cranberry beans so gorgeous and delicious so use these you've got to take them out of the pods all right just like shelling a pea so I did that and I had about just over a cup of cranberry beans also known as shelling beans for obvious reasons I'm going to dump those in I'm also going to add some chopped cabbage very classic minestrone ingredient I'm going to spice it up a little bit with some red pepper flakes some dry Italian herbs and a big pinch of salt I'm going to give that a stir and I'm also going to add a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans I really like our Bonzo beans in this soup they had just a little bit of extra substance and meatiness and I like so I put them in but really any can being product will work in this all right when that comes up to a simmer I'm going to turn my heat down to medium-low and I'm just going to simmer that until those cranberry beans are tender it's going to take about 45 minutes and while that's happening I'm going to prep another critical ingredient the greens I'm using Swiss chard in this case I have a nice big bunch of Swiss chard washed very thoroughly all right you can use the stems and the leaves for the stems simply slice across like that and sort of a small dice for the leaves I usually just roll them up roughly chop them I go one way then I kind of go the other there's no wrong way to slice Swiss chard so relax okay so my greens are prepped again make sure those are thoroughly thoroughly rinsed we're going to go back over to our soup pot and you'll notice me adding water here anytime the soup looks like it might be getting a little too thick add some water we need enough liquid to cook the ingredients and at the end we need enough liquid to cook the pasta okay as soon as my shelling beans my cranberry beans were tender I'm testing one right there I'm going to dump in my greens stir those in I'm going to simmer those for about 15 minutes and we are getting close to being done look how beautiful that is already and I reven have the pasta in speaking of which we're going to use Dietl Eenie these little mini tubes the official pasta shape of minestrone and I know what you're thinking that doesn't look like very much there's no way that's enough oh you're going to be amazed like two-thirds of a cup here is enough for this giant pot of soup all right before you add the pasta very critical adjust your seasoning I added some black pepper I tasted for salt and added more salt all right so you want this soup to be fully seasoned especially for salt when you dump in that pasta all right you're going to dump in the pasta you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high you want this to be simmering pretty good so the pasta cooks and just doesn't sit in hot soup and 15 minutes later as soon as the pasta is tender you're ready to ladle that into some hot bowls and serve this magnificent and big soup I like to finish mine off with some extra virgin olive oil just drizzle it right over the top you know that one we're telling you never to cook with to save it to finish things all right that's the one we want you to use here also a light dusting of Reggiano parmesan does not hurt and is highly recommended and then to brighten it up a little bit add a little freshness and color some Italian parsley all right don't forget the big hunk of bread and then you're going to dig in to one of the best soups ever invented so comforting delicious and relatively healthy for you and like I said this is made differently every time if you want to put carrot in put carrot if you have green beans put green beans in that leftover bell pepper in the bottom of your vegetable crisper dice that up and throw it in there's no wrong way to make minestrone so I hope you give it a try head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts as usual and as always enjoy
