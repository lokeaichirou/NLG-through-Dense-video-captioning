 hey guys welcome back to Dedes Mediterranean kitchen today I'm going to be making a recipe to fulfill all the requests I've gone to make falafel from scratch yes I said it we're making falafel from scratch my other recipe I was trying to help you guys out and show you how to make it out of the box really easy really quick for those of you guys who are in a hurry and don't have a lot of time and just want a nice falafel sandwich or for those of you who want to learn how to make it from scratch I'm doing that today I remember you can get this recipe and all of my other recipes at WWDC I calm now what we're going to start off with is homos and fava beans now hum bows are homeless peas or garbanzo beans you want two cups of garbanzo beans and a cup and a half of fava beans when you start off when you buy them they're really small and they're going to be dried you're going to want to soak them overnight before you do this so if you know you're going to be making falafel the next day soak your your beans the night before when you soak them they're going to double in size just like that yeah one that's this big and one that's this big see the difference same thing with the fava beans they double in size cuz they absorb all the water what we're going to do we're going to start off by blending these in a food processor until they're very crumbly now you don't want to do it out of the can only because the garbanzo beans or chickpeas that are out of the can have a lot of preservatives in them and they're a little bit too wet for the falafel and that mixture becomes too moist and it will fall apart on you when you're trying to fry it no use spoon being on the side to make sure that they all get blended the same way you want to get a large bowl and you want to empty them let me show you look how crumbly the mixture is there not a paste they're just very crumbly now while you're doing all of this you want to heat about an inch of oil in a pan vegetable oil corn oil as long as the vegetable oil that's fine put it on low heat and that the oil warm up for preparedness and next what we're going to do is we're going to blend the fava beans make sure you buy the peel tava beans I know that sometimes they sell them unpeeled you want them peeled put it in the blender blend in the same way that you did summer bottom just the fava beans and they are in the same texture as the homeless or as well we call it homeless in Arabic but they're called a chickpeas or garbanzo beans these are fava beans we use a lot of beans in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cooking as I'm sure you've noticed now you have them in a nice Bowl just mix it up with a spoon next we're going to blend the other ingredients in the blender and then add okay we are halfway there next thing you're going to need also you're going to blend it in the food processor is one big yellow onion I just chopped it up coarsely just that it fits in the processor you're going to also need one a whole bunch of cilantro or about two cups make sure you wash them rinse them out really well you don't have to chop them up or anything because we're going to put them in the food processor and you want one cup or a half a bunch of parsley flat leaf Italian parsley is the best it has a lot of flavor the main ingredient the best ingredient in the world garlic eight nice large cloves of garlic minced if you already have your garlic minced you want two large tablespoons of garlic garlic is amazing adds great aroma agree adds a great element to the dish it's great so let's put all these in the food processor and then we're going to blend them up make sure they all fit in here and then just blend it up until it's well combined okay now that that's done we're going to add it to the green mixture make sure not to lose any of the onion or garlic mmm this is so good so all worth it all you've got all you fans out there booth in emailing me and Tommy please make the other four level please make it from scratch please please please I am doing this for you so what ended next thing we're going to add to this is a half cup of regular Anon seasoned breadcrumbs just a half cup you want two teaspoons of salt just like that see you want one large tablespoon of coriander you want one teaspoon of cumin and then you want a half a teaspoon or quarter teaspoon I'm sorry I've KN pepper cayenne pepper adds a little bit of a kick if you don't like anything spicy you don't have to add it so we'll just add this to it and then we have to add some freshly ground black pepper just about a quarter teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon now you want to combine everything make sure you combine it very well now if you see the mixture is a little bit too dry you can add a tablespoon or so of water let's see now I have the oil heating medium to low heat because you want the falafel to cook all the way through now I have a falafel maker and I have two spoons I'm going to show you how to make it both ways you also want a dish with a paper towel in it to absorb any extra oil you don't want them to come out too oily so you get that falafel put it in the mold just like that this is how you make it in the restaurants you fold make it all nice you're just going to want to drop in just like that let me show you how to make it with two spoons if you don't have the mold that's fine if you buy that the box for my website I actually comes with a falafel maker the falafel mold if you have two spoons then you don't need it it does look at that you can just mold up two spoons and you have little around falafel and just drop it in now I'm fired up from the falafel look how nice and pretty they are they're nice and crispy make sure that if you're going to be making the falafel make it right before your guests arrive or right before you want to serve it you don't want to make it to have it too in advance because if you have to reheat it in the oven it becomes chewy becomes not crispy I mean it's beautifully crispy you can feel it and it smells amazing I'm going to serve this up in a pretty dish point two I'm going to serve it with our taneous sauce that you can get this recipe on my website at wwlp.com tangy sauce just and you can serve this with pita bread you can serve it just with the salad just like a bad Boop's a little bit with us it's okay I want to sprinkle some parsley on top and some green onions or shallots it's beautiful there you go you have original homemade falafel from scratch right me I want to know how your recipe turns out I want to make sure that you guys are making this and showing off to all of your friends enjoy and join me again for Dedes mediterranean kitchen
