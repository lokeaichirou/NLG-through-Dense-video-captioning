 hi I'm rockin Robin from cooking Mexican recipes calm and today I'm going to be making some authentic carne asada street tacos now this recipe was sent to me by a reader to my website named Bruce hurt Bruce originally is from Southern California and he moved to Washington State and he couldn't find any really good Mexican food so he wanted to create his own and that's what he did here with this recipe and I'm going to share that with you today and also I'd like to invite you to go to my website and read his version of it and I'll leave a link below for you to find that so the first thing I want to do is go over our marinade and all of our ingredients so what we have here is we're going to be using a pound and a half of skirt steak now Bruce says that this is the best kind of meat to use you can use flank steak but this one has a little bit more marbling the skirt steak has more marbling for more flavor and it's a little bit more tender now we're also going to need a couple two cups of orange juice I've got some freshly squeezed lime juice and right here I've got some cumin seed and some minced garlic and some chopped up fresh cilantro and some salt and pepper okay so what we're going to do is we're going to mix our marinade together in a bowl first so we get all the ingredients combined so we're gonna pour the orange juice in first and we want to have enough marinade obviously to cover our meat that's our lime juice our cumin seed and our fresh garlic cilantro and you can always vary the amount of this if you want if you don't like too much longer you can put less or if you love it put a lot and then on our salt and pepper so we're going to combine this and then we're going to put everything including the meat into a ziploc bag now we're going to put everything in our ziplock bag and hopefully I won't spill it all right so I'll put the meat in first be brave and pour it in okay here we go okay so we want to make sure that that marinade is covering the meat now before we before we seal it up we want to get as much of the air out of it as we can all right so we're going to kind of just push it around a little bit and then we're going to put this in the refrigerator for at least four hours and Bruce's put it in for as long as two days so the longer it stays the more it's going to really tenderize that meat my meats been marinating in the refrigerator now for a good four hours and remember it's always better if you could go overnight that would be optimal and while while that was marinating I went ahead and I chopped up this is a half of a white onion finely minced and I've got some chopped cilantro which I'm going to just pour in and just kind of mix together now what we're going to do next is what's next is we're going to take this out we're going to barbecue our meat and then bring it in we're going to chop it up and then we're ready to put it together and serve it all right I've got my barbecue heating up here on medium-high heat and I'm going to go ahead and put the meat on the grill this is going to be a little messy but wow the meats already really really softened up take me a couple minutes here to get this on and it's not going to take very long to cook because this meat is quite thin we're going to sear it up whoo I can smell it I can smell the citrus it's awesome I think my stomach is rumbling now you want to make sure you throw out your marinade after you're done you don't want to keep that I'm going to go ahead and close the lid and check this in just a couple of minutes it's not going to take very long at all okay so we're gonna have a look at this we don't want to overcook it oh look at that nice grill marks after we cut this up we're probably going to heat it again at least that's what Bruce tells me we're going to heat it up a little bit more in the microwave because it's going to cool off as we cut it up smells incredible nice and tender ok another minute on that side we'll take it off all right so now I think we're ready to take the meat off and it looks pretty good nice grill marks I move these over to the side because they were done first now this one here is still just a little bit more rare than the others but we'll probably be heating it up a little bit in the in the microwave so we're going to take those off take them in and then cut it up and serve it alright so now we're ready to cut up our meat into thumbnail sized pieces so we'll make strips like this you can see it's still a little bit rare but it's going to go into the microwave that'll cook it up a little bit more only because by the time I get done cutting all this up it's it's going to cool off and we can't have cold food it's got to be hot to be good place it all back into the dish here as I cut it up and we'll just continue cutting our pieces up so I've got my meat all chopped up into little pieces here and the next thing we're going to do is heat up our corn tortillas now Bruce likes to make them authentic with white corn so that's what we have here and what I'm going to do today is is put them in my tortilla oven and put them in the microwave for about a minute and then they will stay piping hot and then we're going to heat up our meat again to make sure it's piping hot and then I'll plate it up so we've got our tortillas hot I've used my tortilla oven and you can see I don't know if you can see the steam is just pouring out of this thing and I reheated the meat a little bit so that it is nice and hot and we're going to put two tortillas down I'm going to make two here put them together hotsy-totsy x' okay separate that so they will come apart so all we do now is add some of our nice hot carne asada just like that make to hear all the smells are incredible guys this is really really smelling good and then all we do is top it off with our onions and cilantro look at that beautiful now so here you have authentic carne asada street tacos so
