 hi guys welcome to et student Channel and today is the day when you will learn how to make some fantastic spring rolls so let's get started here I have some shredded cabbage in this one I have some shredded carrots you can use any vegetables of your choice you can use a bean sprout beans cauliflower whatever you would like in your spring rolls and then I'm also going to use some onions some ginger and garlic now these are frozen ones so they kind of look weird but we're gonna fry them and then we are going to use a pastry wrap here and you can see that I had actually put them on a plate which is covered with a wet towel and we're going to fill our stuffing in this so really easy to make we're going to fry our onions along with ginger garlic paste and in this we are going to add our spices salt red chilli powder garam masala if you want a little Indian flavor and some soy sauce give them a quick stir soften them a little bit okay so salt as per taste I'm going to go ahead and add two teaspoons here and red chili powder you can also add green chillies if you like starting our onions ginger garlic salt red chilli powder and in this we'll go ahead and add our soy sauce so 2 tablespoons of soy sauce soy sauce and onions have become a little soft we'll go ahead and add our vegetable next now you don't have to try them a lot just sorted them lightly because if you try them a lot they might start leaving from water which we don't want we're just going to solder them a little bit here so our stuffing is ready we'll set it aside and here I have 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour that's metha and I'm just going to add a few drops of water to make a fine paste so just mix it well to have a smooth paste and we are going to use this as a glue to close our spring rolls you just mix them together and set them aside so we are using this spring roll pastry you can find it at any Asian grocery store and what I'm what I have done this was frozen I have caught it and you don't want it to dry out so I had kept it in a wet cloth so in our pastry here we are going to put our stuffing and you want to make it that it's nice and tight and we're going to roll it out so take one corner and put it in and slowly roll this go right in the middle and stop now turn the corners and continue the process when you reach the very end what you need to do is that all corpus collaborate that we made just take a little bit put it at the end and close this so make all your rolls like this look at that beautiful Hey and what I'm going to do now is deep-fry them you can pan fry them if you want but it's spring roll so you got to deep fry them so hot oil in the wok and we just added our spring rolls and we going to fry them until they are brown on both sides look at that beautiful golden on all sides exactly the way we wanted so now we'll go ahead and serve it hot and crispy look at that so our spring roll is ready to be enjoyed let me do a little taste test so once you've mastered the technique of making these spring rolls trust me you will never ever order them again at a restaurant so go ahead give them a shot and let me know how they turn out for you and I'll see you again very soon with something more exciting
