 hi guys I'm Bridget Davis be internet chef and today I've got a little recipe for you I'm going to teach you how to cook the best scrambled eggs so first if you want to come down here and see what I've got in front of me I've got three free-range eggs I've also got just maybe going to use about a tablespoon of butter a little bit of um sea salt flakes there and in the jug here I've got about a third of a cup of cream so in order to make the world's best scrambled eggs you need to break your 3x until the world so once they're in the bowl avoiding the egg shell of course we're going to add our third of a cup of cream to that little bowl over here we're going to put the pan on I'm using a nonstick pan which is really really important I'm using the induction cooktop and I'm turning on the pan to induction setting eight which is about medium to hot on your gas or your electric cooktop then we're going to take a fork is our pan is heating up and just mix the cream and the egg together there what I'm trying to achieve it just that yolk is mixed through so don't want these tricks of yolk you know in our egg mixture as our pan is heating up I'm just going to take just the smallest knob of butter there put it into the pan and that's going to begin to melt through I'm also going to take a little bit of our sea salt flakes they're going to go into the base of the pan which is going to help those sea salt flakes to start to dissolve there the heat from the pan so back to our egg mixture it's looking pretty good the yolks are mixed through nicely one our butter to start sizzling once we've got this little sizzling action happening here now in our pan almost ready to put our egg yolk mixture in order to help me make this this best scrambled egg recipe successful I'm also using a flat ended wooden spoon as I talked about this is a nonstick pan as well which is really really important we don't want the egg to stick to the base of the pan so now that sizzle happening there's no color in my butter which is also really important I'm going to drop my eggs into the base of the pan now what you need to do is you need to resist resist the urge to scramble your eggs because what you want to start happening is that egg yolk is going to begin to set the protein is going to begin to sit on the base of that pan so about 20 seconds once you put that egg mixture into the base of the pan you want to wait about 20 seconds before you're even going to start to attempt to scramble as I'm shaking the pan as you can see what's happening I've got these all bubbles beginning to form down there so I know that proteins sitting really well so once I've got my bath bubbles bubbles bubbles my bubbles size of all I want to take my flat in the wooden spoon and begin to very very gently nudge these eggs around the pan as I'm nudging the cook stuff the raw pot stuff is then taking its place just enough time for me to grab a little bit of Parmesan cheese and grate that in because it's going to help the flavor perfect back to my wooden spoon give it a bit of a nudge so the cook stuff makes way for the raw stuffs of what you are getting is the most gentle and delicious lightly cooked scrambled eggs and that pretty much is it once you're at that stage we turn it off and the heat that's left on their scrambled eggs will continue to cook us through and you will guarantee have on the best scrambled egg recipes ever thank you
