 hey hey I'm Hilah welcome back to Hilah cooking so this is Episode one on season three and it's pretty awesome that it's season three already and I'm really excited to be back I had a really great summer I hope everyone else did too I had a lot of hot dogs among other things but this is a really fun way to make hot dogs that I started doing and I thought I'd be a fun way to start off season three so today Mexican hot dogs LA now you may be thinking what's a Mexican hot dog hila are you being racist but let me assure you that I am NOT Mexican hot dog is something that was actually originated in the state of Sonora in Mexico that's like just south of California so sometimes it's called a Sonoran hot dog and basically what it is and there's a couple of different things so it's got to have bacon wrapped around it let me see here look BAM bacon and hot dogs you wrap them in the bacon daily then you get some green salsa and mayonnaise those are also essential things pico de gallo I like to put that on there I like mustard too and then these rolls these are called bolillo rolls they're like a mexican french bread roll real soft you can use regular hot dog buns but these are delish and if you want to you could also use like a big soft like french bread and like cut it into chunks and use that but I got these because I live in Tejas so I'm lucky enough to get that stuff okay so I'm going to show you start with some preparations with some Bacon's and some hotdogs okay so we're gonna take our bacon pieces and wrap each hotdogs in bacon to make a little spiral like like so just kidding that's raw okay so I'm going to do that and then cook them okay so I'm going to turn my skillet on here I got my my trusty cast iron as usual and go ahead and put my little guys in and I want to kind of try to get it so that the little like the ends are on the bottom as much as possible that'll help it stick together a little better as you cook them the bacon is very likely to kind of unroll a little bit that it'll stay on good enough so it'll be still be totally yummy so just relax okay so we're just gonna watch these fry for a little while probably ten minutes or so we'll roll them around a little bit and then we'll put them on a yummy roll with some yummy condiments okay so this has been about seven minutes or so a Bacon's all crispy my hotdogs are all like getting a little burnt up on the ends which I like I'm not burned but you know um my dogs getting real excited because she likes Mexican hot dogs too I cut my bends on the top so it'll look real cute when I fill it up with stuff I'm just gonna kind of let them get a little bit toasted and also soak up some bacon grease um yay all right so now it's time to dress these up I'm gonna put some mayonnaise and all that stuff on it all right so first we got the mayonnaise which might seem weird to some people but it's kind of required unless you totally hate mayonnaise I guess you could leave it off mmm okay and I got some yellow mustard and this is preferred over like any kind of fancy whoa like you know whatever just get the yellow mustard it's good for you got tumeric okay then hot dog for me hot dog for me and some of the screen salsa which I'll put the recipe on the website I just I mean it's real easy just wrote some stuff and put it in a blender you can do it um some Tico Gaia which I think I'll also put this on there which is also just cutting stuff up and mixing it together super easy and sometimes you might put avocado on it whatevs and then I also have some pickled jalapenos oh my god this is saying good baby oh geez should have been working out over the summer also apparently okay so Emily Emily Emily's mom made these so thanks Bev alright throw some of these on there and some little pickled onions too yay alright ok go some mmm Wow awesome I'll roll messy so have some napkins ready okay I'm talking you should try that um I'll put it up on the site with all the salsa recipes and stuff um I'm really glad to be back super excited so we'll still be doing new episodes every Tuesday I'm going to start doing blog post every Thursday and Saturday you can try that for a little while and see how those dates work for you and also they'll be like more recipes and stuff on the site then then video so yay more stuff to cook with me um yeah it's also on my nose also I wrote a book if you didn't hear about that learn to cook book it's really awesome you should get it alright see you next week you
