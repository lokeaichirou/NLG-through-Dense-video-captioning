 Oh hi I'm Angie and today I'm making a croque monsieur bake this is kind of a French style ham and cheese sandwich that's dipped in egg and this recipe is convenient because you prepare it the night before and you want to refrigerate it overnight so this does take a little bit of advanced planning but it's very easy to do the first thing I've done is preheated the oven to 350 degrees because we're going to toast the bread first I've got 12 slices of just regular white bread this is square sandwich bread I don't usually use this but for this recipe that's what it's called for so you just want to lay it out on your baking sheet it's okay if it overlaps we're gonna toast it and a preheated oven for about 20 minutes turning it over halfway through so I'll put this in the oven for 20 minutes and then we'll continue on with the recipe okay while I'm waiting for the other side of the bread to toast I'm just going to lightly oil a 9 by 13 glass baking dish with some vegetable oil and we're going to layer the bread with ham and cheese and then put an egg mixture over top and then put it in a refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight okay and this measuring cup I've got 8 large eggs that I've cracked I'm going to whisk in 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 2 cups of 2% milk or half and half cream and a teaspoon of salt just whisk that all together and I'll set that aside now in our 9 by 13 glass baking dish I'm just going to layer 6 pieces of the toast and you can kind of squish it in if you have to that's pretty well and I'll pour 1/3 of the egg mixture evenly over top now I'm going to layer it with some cheese I'm going to use Swiss cheese slices but you can use grated Swiss cheese or shredded cheddar as well a lot better cheddar for that piece and now I've got about eight slices of thinly sliced ham I'm just going to lay that over too I'll just cut it into thirds and now another cup of cheese so on top of that now I'll be using the grated cheddar and now I'll layer on the last six slices of bread and you want to press firmly down on the bread get it in there and now I'm going to pour the remaining egg mixture all over and one more cup of cheese sprinkled on top so now you just want to cover this and refrigerate it for eight hours or overnight after the eight hours when you're ready to bake the dish we want to take it out of the fridge and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and you're going to bake this in the lower third of the oven you want to bake it uncovered for about 45 minutes or until it's golden on top so I'll wait eight hours I'll bake it off and I'll show it to you when it's done thanks for watching and I hope you try some croque-monsieur baked you
