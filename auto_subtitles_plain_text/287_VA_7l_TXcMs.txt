 [Music] can anyone believe that these are the homemade mice and masala dosas they look amazing right these are very easy to make so let's get started to how to make this my Sue masala dosa and literally there are many variations of the proportions to prepare the batter for the dosa or even Italy if you are going to use this proportion the outcome will be you get a crispy dosa and and it literally melts in your mouth because of the poha and that's because it gives sponginess and the crisp penis comes from the rice this is a great way to prepare a very good dosa for though my Sood masala dosa or any dosa and here are the list of the ingredients that you need to prepare this dosa the preparation of the dosa is a multi-step process it involves an soaking and the preparing the batter and fermenting the batter and then making the dosas so it takes a long time so before you get started you make sure that you have the enough time to prepare all this stuff so first of all we need to add all these four ingredients and along with the meaty Donna or the fenugreek seeds you need to mix all the ingredients and wash them and rinse them well using the fresh water and drain all the water and add the fresh water again and then rest it for a couple of hours and overnight should be best so later on we are going to grind it to make a coarse batter not a very smooth batter for the dosa but it should be a little bit of course yesterday night have done that the soaking process is completed and as you see all the greens and the doll has plumped up and doubled in the volume and it would be great while blending it will be easy and for grinding you can use the or the mixer or the normal blender so let's get started with our blending process I've drained all the water from the rice that have been soaking overnight and this water is helpful in aiding the fermentation process while blending the dolls and the rice I'm gonna use the same water in which the doll and the rice have been soaking I'm just gonna add a little bit of the mixture about 1/4 cup approximately into the London on top I'm gonna use the grinder over here and into this I'm gonna add a little bit of water I'm gonna start off using the little amount of dough rise in the doll mixture a little amount of water otherwise it will be not blended properly so now I'm gonna start this process I'm gonna add the remaining mixture in regular intervals about 4 to 5 minutes and blend everything the same way I'm going to show you just I'm going to add a little bit of water make sure that you scrape off the sides of the grinder or the blender so that the mixture will be grinded evenly and you don't find any lumps or the grains left in the batter and I'm gonna just add a little bit rice on the doll mixture and carry on with the blending process till I finish everything I'm again gonna add a little bit of water and start the blending again and now here we go I'm gonna aren't everything I'm done making the batter and I ended up using about 1 cup of water while blending this and the texture of the battery should look like this it's a little bit on coarse side not very smooth so now this goes into the warm oven so that it gets fermented well I'm gonna just cover this and I've already warmed up the oven to about 180 Fahrenheit or approximately 200 Fahrenheit should be fine with the batter and I've turned it off after it reached that certain temperature how to turn it off and now I'm gonna move this onto the form oven you can just leave it in a warm place but here in here in the place where we are living now it's very cold right now so I'm gonna move this on to the warm oven which I have heated up and turned it off to about 180 Fahrenheit are about 200 Fahrenheit should be fine too and after every four hours or five hours I'm going to take off the batter from the oven and again warm the oven to about 200 Fahrenheit and turn it off and just pop it into the oven and I'll be carrying on for every four to five hours about two to three times so that it gets fermented well so now we'll be back after about approximately 10 to 12 hours of fermentation so that the dosa batter will be fermented well it's been about 12 hours now so let's check on the dosa batter I think it has got fermented very well actually I can see a lot of bubbles over here this says that it has very bad fermented now I'm gonna add salt to this this is according to your taste I'm gonna add about 1 teaspoon after the fermentation process it's actually thickened up so now I'm gonna add about 1 by 4th cup of water to this to it into the right consistency but totally in the preparation of dosa batter I approximately used about one and a half cups of water approximately but it differs so be careful while adding the water and the consistency of the batter should look like this it's not thick and not too thin and it's perfect actually I can see a lot of bubbles and this is how the batter should look like your aha got a pan I'm gonna check it if it's hot then it's ready I have tested by adding some water so now it's ready to make the dosa just spread the batter in a circular motion cook it for 30 seconds and afterwards I'm gonna add some oil to this I'm gonna add a little bit of oil to this and cook it for about a minute till you can find the brown specks from the topside now I'm gonna flip this actually some people don't like to cook them on the both of the sides but I like to cook them on both sides just flip this and I'm gonna cook for about 30 seconds not again I'm gonna flip this on to another side and I'm gonna apply the chutney the recipe for this onion chutney is on my channel so you can check it and you can make it it just tastes so great I just love this chutney you can apply it as much as you like but be careful it's gonna be spicy I'm gonna at the Illuma G you also can check this recipe on my channel so now it's ready I'm just gonna close this like this and wow it just looks awesome it has got a wonderful blonde color and it looks just amazing and now I'm gonna just move this on to the serving platter I'm gonna serve this dosa along with some chutney you can find the recipe for this chat me on my channel I'm gonna prepare the dough sauce with the remaining batter the same way so enjoy this dosa the Mike Zulu masala dosa with your family
