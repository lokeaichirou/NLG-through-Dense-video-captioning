 hey everybody and welcome to the Wolfe pit hey tonight we're gonna make some barbecue pork fried rice and these are the the breast bone trimmings the did from the st. Louis ribs over the weekend and so pull them out out of the freezer and I'm go ahead and just pull all this meat off here and use this since they're all having a char siew to make the pork fried rice with but this is actually probably a pretty good substitution okay we're ready to go ahead and get our fried rice going so we have a hot a medium hot wok here over medium-high heat we're gonna add about two tablespoons of oil in here and go ahead and start off scrambling three eggs one egg per cup of rice we use the three cups rice and that's just my rolling a scramble I think I mentioned it before but the whole point in scrambled eggs prior to fry the rice is that way the eggs don't clump around your rice make big balls of rice and your your fried rice so we're gonna go ahead and remove these from the wok all right now we're gonna go ahead and add a little bit more oil about another tablespoon or two mu naught 2 tablespoons there alright once our oils heated up we're gonna go ahead and add in one large yellow onion you don't have to use this much onion but I like a lot of onion in my fried rice I know gonna head in for clothes rub the chopped garlic knowing that in our barbecue pork stir-fry this just to beat the pork back through all right now we're gonna add in three types of cook right turn at Brad and the rice we're gonna add about teaspoon maybe two teaspoons of sesame oil more or less how much you like we're gonna add about two tablespoons of soy sauce again this is all preference there's no correct recipe for this all right we're gonna add two cups of frozen lakes vegetables peas carrots and corn and green beans all right after the rice stir-fry for a few minutes we're going to go ahead and add our eggs back in all right barbecue pork fried rice is done let's get to see one get a little close up here real quick looks almost good him up deep doesn't it dig into this with a spoon I'm not gonna embarrass myself in with chopsticks in front of you guys try the rice so let's get in here in the middle and let's see we got there got a little pork carrot peas rice let's give this a try see how it turns out hmm you immediately taste the smokiness from the pork and then the sesame oil look at that pork looks kind of just like char siew doesn't it mmm let's get some egg on this one delicious Wow sometimes I think I'm agent take one more bite here absolutely perfect well and I forgot to mention to the rice I used I cooked it early this morning so let's sit on stove all day and you don't want to cook rice right immediately when you're ready to make fried rice you either won't do it day before or a little bit in time advance so have fun dry out and separate a little bit and as you can see this is not sticky at all not clumpy eggs releasing this everything's loose it's delicious great flavor well thank you guys very much for watching and we'll see you next time
