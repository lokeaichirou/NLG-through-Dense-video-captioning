 I'm going to make some wings today and here I have 30 wings or 15 wings that are cut in half and makes 30 pieces so I'm going to take a big bowl and add two cups of flour to it [Music] add pepper a teaspoon of pepper and salt two teaspoons of salt just blend this real fast then take them to all my chicken pieces in here just cover these with flour very well you need to let this sit for 30 minutes so that the flour really sticks on there very well and I put these in the fridge rater for 30 minutes next is I'm going to take the barbecue sauce and just put all of that in there [Music] I'll come back to it and get more out now I'm going to put honey in here we need about half a cup of honey the barbecue sauce we need two cups and I would say that's probably a half a cup of honey I'm going to put in onion powder about 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon that's about half take Hickory seasoning which is liquid smoke I'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of that in here see if more barbecue sauce comes out I'm gonna mix this up it's going to go into the microwave because I want to make sure that the honey really melts into the barbecue sauce cover it up into the microwave for about three minutes I'm adding my chicken I'm going to do 10 pieces at a time so that'll be three batches we'll fry this up [Music] now fry them for 13 minutes and pick them out and put them directly into the balls ball of the barbecue sauce and mix them around in the sauce I let the oil compact up to temperature and dry the next step actually this is the second batch right here I'm mixing up I take them out and put them in another bulb and once this oil eats up I will fry the last batch here's half of them and let's try a bite [Music] on two [Music] they're softer said so good [Music] thanks for watching [Music]
