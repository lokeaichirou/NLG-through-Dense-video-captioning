 time to make one of my all-time favorite lunches it's crispy it's fresh and delicious and everyone loves it let's make sand Caesar salad on the one pot chef first things first I'm just making a boiled egg now you've seen me make boiled eggs before in the past but basically we're just going to boil the egg for about six to seven minutes until it's hard-boiled let it cool off peel off the shell and then dice it up into little pieces I'm also cooking up some bacon I'm just using some short rivals bacon which I've just chopped up we're just going to fry this up until it's nice and crispy next I'm making some croutons now traditionally croutons are little cubes of bread which are deep fried I'm doing a slight variation on this because I don't like to deep fry bread I find it really greasing oily so I'm just going to bake them I'm going to spray them with a little bit of cooking spray then place them into an oven 180 degrees Celsius for about five to ten minutes or until they're nice and golden toasted then we'll be ready to move on croutons are looking golden and gorgeous so let's just leave those aside for the moment while we work on our salad dressing to make our Caesar salad dressing first we've got half a cup of whole egg mayonnaise and to that I'm adding in one teaspoon of crushed garlic about one clove I'm cheating and using the stuff out of the jar don't judge me I'm also adding in two anchovy Phillips which I've just chopped up nicely now you don't have to put the anchovies in but it is kind of what gives this the traditional Caesar salad flavor so try to use it don't be put off by the agent and I'm also adding in two tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice and just mix that all up to combine I think we're about ready to combine everything together and make our Caesar salad in my big salad bowl I've got one large cause letters which I've just roughly torn up please note this serves about four or five people so this isn't just one serving so into that I'm going to add in our croutons bacon diced boiled egg little bit of shaved parmesan cheese just over the top and last but not least we're just going to drizzle over the dressing and that's that absolutely gorgeous smelling the taste is going to be fantastic I can't wait to just quickly dive in mm-hmm dressing is gorgeous your parmesan and crispy lettuce what more could you want well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at 1pachi a calm and until next time see you later
