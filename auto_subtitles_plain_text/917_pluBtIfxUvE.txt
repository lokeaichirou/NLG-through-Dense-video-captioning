 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with lobster scrambled eggs that's right i'm gonna help solve one of america's biggest home cooking dilemmas what to do with all that leftover lobster hey we've all been there anyway all kidding aside you may in fact one day have leftover lobster and scrambled eggs is a fantastic way to use them up so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take a saute pan on medium low heat with a nice chunk of butter when the butter melts I'm gonna add my lobster chunks you'll notice they're still in fairly large pieces you don't want to dice it or mince it up like I've seen in some recipes you want to know you're eating lobster okay so don't chop it up leave it nice big pieces as soon as that lobster starts to warm through its not really cooking it's just starting to gently sizzle in the butter and the chills been taken off I'm gonna add my eggs to which I've added a couple tablespoons of tarragon leaves one of my favorite favorite seafood herbs especially with lobster just a perfect perfect pairing I'm gonna turn the heat up to medium I'm gonna take a spatula I'm obviously using a nonstick pan here I'm gonna keep it moving until it's done or you got to keep it moving I don't want big chunks of rubbery scrambled eggs in lobster I want this very very very soft and very very custardy now the only other times I've made this I've actually scrambled the eggs first and then when they were almost done I folded the lobster meat in which does work but here I wanted to try something different I wanted to start with the lobster in the pan and I wanted to scramble the eggs with the lobster to possibly impart more lobster flavor into the dish the risk of course is overcooking the lobster which I'm happy to announce did not happen alright and again very important you keep it moving keep that spatula scraping against the bottom of the pan so that no part of the egg stays in one place too long so I'm going to keep it moving keep it moving when it got to this point and it was almost there I stopped why because by the time you put the spatula down and you get your warm plate and you go ahead and you serve it up it continues to cook from the residual heat in the lobster and the eggs so if you think okay it's almost where I want it stop put it on the plate by the time you dig your fork in it's gonna be absolutely perfect and there you go a little bit of toast a cup of coffee and you are in breakfast heaven so next time you have a bunch of leftover lobster hanging around I know happens all the time you should give this a try super great way to use it up all right so I'm gonna dig in here and you can see that custardy egg just a beautiful sweet buttery taste luxurious texture that little bit of anisette flavor from the tarragon kind of a licorice flavor profile just fantastic with this and my theory about cooking the lobster with the eggs instead of adding at the end totally worked this really did have a stronger lobster flavor then the other version I described really really delicious I hope you give this a try check out food wishes com for all the ingredient amounts as usual and as always enjoy you
