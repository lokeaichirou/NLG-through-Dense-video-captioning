 hello youtube and welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to prepare a very famous Japanese soup call me so and this is the way I do it start by adding like four cups to the pan of water that is and bring it to a boil you will see how easy this recipe is when the water comes to a boil I lower the heat let it rest a little bit and I put one of these where's the camera here home does she went back eight grams that goes right in if you add the home dashi when the water is super boiling then a big bubble of water is gonna come up so that's why you have to wait a little bit in the meantime while the water was boiling I cut up some enoki mushrooms and some tofu try to give it a little stir and then I add the ingredients you could add whatever ingredients I just happen to have this in the kitchen in the refrigerator so but it's your choice and good I also add niggy cut Nikki but I want to cook the mushrooms a little bit before adding it and the niggy cooks quicker so I don't want it to get too mushy mushy she-she-she machine so a few minutes have passed you can see that it's starting to get bubbly so then I add the Negi the good thing in Japan is that you can find the you already cut because in the United States I had to cut cut cut cut cut window cuz I but she anyway I lower the heat he then put that little basket because now I'm going to add the miso and one very important thing about the miso is that it can never boil so please be careful not to boil the miso it is okay to lower the heat or actually turn it off if you want so I'm going to add like I don't know is this two tablespoons three tablespoons I just do everything by eye so and the basket is this is a really nice basket because it holds to the pan perfect so I can carry the camera so you move it around until it dissolves obviously with one hand I'm going very slow that's basically it the mixer is done like I said it's very important not to boil the me so now I little something I like to do is add a little drop of soy sauce I don't know why because I like it that's it and this is the miso as you can see it was very simple to make if you liked it please subscribe comment and hit the like button and I hope you come back to see more recipes eat a lucky month
