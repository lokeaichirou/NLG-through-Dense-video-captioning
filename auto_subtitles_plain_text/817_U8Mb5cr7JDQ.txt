 sauerkraut it's a bit underappreciated I think in my family but I like it so I keep making it and I use it for as a condiment from for me then as a as to put it on some spread or in some salad or so fry it up in some bacon fat and I really like it I even like it raw and on hot dogs now this is all you need to make sauerkraut cabbage salt and some jars to for mints have to ready the cabbage take off the outer leaves if they have any problems take off this stem or the stop like cut a square like or a triangle like this then I can just read me remove the stalk in the middle and I have to measure it and this is about 900 grams I have to divide that with 50 and then I have the amount of salt that I need that is 2% of the weight of the cabbage has to be solved this is 18 grams so this is the soul I need for this half cabbage head then I cut it out in a as thin slices as I absolutely possibly can I make sure to follow the curvature of the cabbage then I end up with a ball like this I add the salt then I have to break down of the cabbage to force out some water because it has to line in a water to to make the fermentation take place and see now it's very soft and very wet and it's that's exactly how it should be and so I fill up the fermentation John we have to put us much in as we possibly can and then we have to press it down because the cabbage has to be covered in water too to be able to ferment otherwise it'll simply rot we press it down hard and see I fill up the jar completely and now it takes up only half the space the other way to do it if you don't want to cut all that cabbage by hand or do the the crossing of the cabbage is to use a machine and I use the piccata like this this is about the same states where whether it was with the knife when I did it the manual way but instead of crossing it with my hands I'll make a finer cabbage if I cut it again I will force out a lot of liquid so the fermentation can take place and as you can see this is a finer structure and but my hands are already weighed by this so this is fine you don't have to cross that add the salt and then mix it round well into the glass with that to the fermentation jar and this is just a plain glass jar it doesn't have to be anything fancy as long as it can become airtight you don't want any air down down in it with the cabbage so it has to ferment for at least three days at room temperature the longer in ferments the more so it will be this is after about a day where I check up on it makes you want see see you can see that's a lot of water has been forced out of the cabbage due to the salt and the crossing and if there's not enough water to cover it you can add a little bit not too much because the salt level is important for the fermentation and then if you just leave it on a cool place until you want to eat it so enjoy and you can find the list of ingredients and the recipe on belly food
