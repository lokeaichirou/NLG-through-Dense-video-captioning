 hi welcome to today's episode of in the kitchen keeping it real I'm your host Ariel and today we're making sauerkraut a naturally fermented vegetable that is phenomenal for you the probiotic quality through the roof when I say sauerkraut I meant to say carrot cumin coriander kraut so it's quite special all we're gonna do is take one head of cabbage which is gigantically large a few carrot sticks get them ground down in our food processor with a I'm using the the shred bleed so you get a nice surface area per vegetable which will really help create a yummy brine ooh baby you look at so good you look at so bright sauerkraut and or all fermented vegetables that are naturally fermented at home nice and wildly like we're doing right now are so good for your digestion the natural probiotic content is something that traditional people for a long long time knew was good for them and always ate and it's an amazing way of keeping your vegetables preserved for Forbes and adds in a day okay so do you see that this was when we started dry and you see how wet it is let me see if I squeeze it if we can see any water come out Wow okay do you see that that water is going to turn into the brine that our kraut will soak in and become fermented so you've got your crowd in there your seeds are on top so this is a nice clean Pyrex filled with water and I've got my plastic lid on there and what I'm gonna do is use this to push down my kraut okay what that's going to do is make the water rise up and that's what we want that liquid over time in the crock covered is what's going to keep the veggies growing the yeast and fermenting you don't need to fuss over it every day for five days minimum you're gonna check it and make sure that the water is coming to the surface if you need to push your thing down again to draw the water up that's fine and I'll check in five days we're back five days minimum later we've got our kraut I can see all those seeds are in there and oh you can smell it's all fermented it'll be perfect with some bratwurst um and I'm gonna keep it in the fridge it'll just get better with time it is good with every meal to have at least something fermented and in old-school times that's there was like a no-brainer in our culture in our country today we don't really do that because we don't know - but forever in a day ago it was like duh you always that's why I mean that's why wine is so common with dinner right that's a fermented drink kimchi in Asia and crowd and Eastern Europe and hot sauce used to always be naturally fermented you couldn't just go to the supermarket and buy it and so yeah with every meal you want to have about two tablespoons of something fermented it's just super super great for your digestion and then when you're done packing your kraut down you can save the brine and for your next batch if you wanted to add a little bit of juice and Brian from your last one boom I'm gonna finish packing this guy down and then we're gonna try some so guys really special thing that happened when we got this all packets down and ready to try one of my awesome film crew members of digital moon Peter who is from the Czech Republic got so animated about sauerkraut and started trying to tell me a story that I was like come on camera so you're from the Czech Republic you grew up eating this stuff tell me how did your family make kraut you know I was watching a TV or doing something you know I scared to do and all the sudden my grandfather you know drove the u-haul full of cabbage and brought a big ball and we just started you know chopping it and grinding it and I had to just stand up in the pot and you know Wow you used your fingers oh my gosh that's so old-school that's the way we used to do it that's the way it used to be done and after that always just went you know my mom sent me to the basement I just grabbed it with my hand Wow from the bar that she put it you know on the stove and cooked it that was great Wow I'm terrified to have Peter try this because sounds like he's got some real-deal kraut history but let's see what he thinks mm-hmm is that the rear is it how does it compare with what you were growing up you guys probably spent I mean if they spent probably months in the basement we never used Garrett okay and it was longer in the basement okay but the fermentation is there it stays great yeah yeah it's sour how do you like the cumin and the coriander oh yeah we thank you so much for sharing that story with us it sounds like you guys had kraut for an entire year more than that guys is this real deal or what we are so stoked on this thanks so much for hanging out with us Peter thank you so much for giving a good spoonful dive into our kraut we'll check you next Wednesday give this recipe a thumbs up like us on Facebook and I'll check you next Wednesday subscribe to the channel for more amazing nourishing traditional Whole Foods ciao you
