 today we're going to be making our food on noodles here we have some dried food on it's a long flat Chinese noodle and it cooks up really nicely in fact it it's really nice and Hardy and holds really well you can see I've got some here already cooked you can hold this in your refrigerator and it does really well we're going to be making it today with some oven-dried Tomatoes some red onions kalamata olives and grilled eggplant this is a really good representation of our restaurant here combining Chinese and Mediterranean ingredients to kind of round out all parallel 33 here so the way I'm going to start is first with my noodles into some hot water make sure my pan is on and nice and hot start with a little canola oil garlic and ginger I'll get that into the pan then I'll add my onions tomatoes eggplant and kalamata olives add a little bit of salt it's important to really let this get a nice sauté going so that all the flavors get released into the noodles and it really helps it from not being quite so bland this point I'm going to add my fresh spinach this is a really good technique that you can use for any time you're sautéing spinach it's a really healthy and light way to cook it I'll add it to the pan just let it get a little bit warm and if I wasn't using noodles i can use about a quarter cup of water and it really wilts the spinach really nicely and helps to retain its flavor and its shape so here we're just going to use the udon noodles that I had get add them to the pan won't saute them up a little bit I'm going to let that spinach wilt just a little bit I'll add a little bit of feta cheese remember feta has a lot of salt in it so you're really going to want to be careful about how you're salting the dish from the beginning the noodles included a little bit of parsley this dish is really fast and really simple once you have all the ingredients set up and ready to go take the noodles I like to go noodles first to kind of create a bed down there we give it a little twist just so we can add a little bit of height to the bowl it's important in the restaurant but not so important if you're cooking at home okay I like to kind of move the vegetables around so that the whole plate is covered with a lot of these nice fresh vegetables we'll add a little bit more feta cheese and some parsley there you have it this is parallel 33s Mediterranean food on noodles
