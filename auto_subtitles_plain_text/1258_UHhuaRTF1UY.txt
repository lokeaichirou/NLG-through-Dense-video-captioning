 hey guys I'm April McKinney and I'm excited today to show you a recipe for General Tso's chicken you've probably seen this on many of the Chinese takeout restaurants it's on almost every menu there's restaurants and usually it's deep fried then tossed in a really thick syrupy sauce it tastes really good but it's not very good for you so I came up with a recipe that's a lot lighter but it still tastes great it's really easy and this is one of those recipes you know I think all the recipes that I that I do from videos are good or else I wouldn't make a video of them but this is one that I really felt good about as soon as I ate it I thought okay this is a home run so if you don't try any recipes you need to try this one so I think you'll really like it so now I'm going to mix up the sauce and what I'm going to start with is actually a quarter cup of low-sodium chicken broth or stock either one works and if you didn't have chicken stock you could use water to replace this and won't be quite as flavorful but it will still work the next thing I'm going to do is two tablespoons of rice vinegar you can find this in the Asian section or the ethnic section of the grocery store or it may be in the vinegar section just depends on what store you're at they're really easy to find very inexpensive and a great ingredient for Asian cooking the next thing is two tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce I always use the low-sodium because soy sauce has a ton of salt in it and I like soy sauce I don't like to not use very much this way I can still use you know two tablespoons and not worry too much about the salt content the next thing I have is a tablespoon of brown sugar and this is just going to add a little bit of sweetness because your most Asian food does have a little bit of sweetness and hotness and a sourness it's kind of get all these different flavor components so we do need a little bit of that and the brown sugar is going to be great because it's got a really rich flavor more than just a white sugar would so we don't have to use quite as much the other thing I'm going to do is I've got two cloves of garlic that minced up I'm just going to put those right in here gonna add a lot of flavor okay and now a pinch of red pepper flakes probably about a 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon depends on how spicy you like it General Tso's chicken is usually sort of spicy so I like to do about 1/4 TSP of the red pepper flakes all right the next thing is kind of an interesting ingredient this is actually fresh ginger it's ground up normally you know with like a jarred garlic or something I don't really recommend using those because they don't taste this fresh but for ginger because I only use it really rarely usually I use a little piece of it and then end up throwing the whole thing away this comes in handy and it still tastes pretty good so I'm going to do about 2 teaspoons of this ground ginger plus it's a lot easier to use this than to peel and mince up ginger so let's just get this whisked up and this is really our sauce the only thing I'm going to add is about half of these scallions the rest I'm just going to use for a garnish on top of the chicken and that's perfect it's easy as that really simple easy to find the ingredients so that parts done the next thing we want to do is we're obviously we're not going to deep-fry this your probe a can see probably anything deep fried on my recipes so what I am going to do now is I'm still going to give it a little bit of a crust and it's gonna be really easy what I have is a cup of regular all-purpose flour I've got a pound and a half of chicken breast here and you can see the size they're about maybe a half inch cubes of chicken and I just cut up if I can get these in here without spilling them there we go perfect I'll just seal this up I love to use the plug bags this kind of thing we give your SPO it away you don't worry about cleaning it and then you're just going to give this shape all right each of these are coated with a little bit of the flour now and so what I'm going to do is head on over to the stove and I'll show you how to put this all together all right so here I have a large skillet I've got a tablespoon of canola oil that has been heated up it's over medium-high heat I really want this skillet to be nice and hot because I want to get this fizzle I want to get make sure that that flour gets nice and brown because we want to have that fried effect on this chicken even though we're obviously not frying it and it is going to be a lot healthier than other versions okay as you can see I'm sort of starting to turn these over and what you want is just to have a slight golden color about like that that little golden color and then you can turn it right over on the other side ok b.split perfect they've got a nice color to them on all sides it really sort of forms a nice crust that is going to make this tape like the real thing let's take this right out and then we'll add in our sauce and I'm actually going to cook it for a minute or so just to kind of get it heated up and let the garlic soften a little bit and then we'll add back in the chicken ok sauce is in now let's get the chicken back in and what I'm going to do is just begin to toss this around and that sauce it's going to thicken because the flour will put on the outside of the chicken we don't have to use corn cornstarch or anything because the flour is going to thicken up that sauce and I'm just going to toss it around while it's on about medium heat until everything is coated and all the chicken is cooked through alright our General Tso's chicken is done so I'm just going to put it in this little serving dish and that way so it looks great and you looking at that you would think this is not a very healthy dish but actually it is really light and I promise you it tastes fantastic almost a bit of stuff from the restaurant and it really it tastes better to me because you know you're not eating just complete crap you're eating something that's really good for you so I'm going to sprinkle these scallions that I reserved right over the top to make it look pretty just like they do with the restaurant this is something fun to do you can make this you see it's really quick to do you can serve with some brown rice and maybe some steamed broccoli or snap peas and you've got just a Chinese meal that's really healthy and easy to do you can feel great about so I've got to get a taste of this I cannot wait any longer love this stuff mmm there's a little spicy it's a little sweet it certainly doesn't taste like it's healthy so I think you're really gonna like this give it a try and and it's spelled TSO so if you like me you've probably gone through a lot of variations of how you say it sometimes I used to say general so swim with a tee in front it's sometimes general sounds I've just gone all through the vocabulary with this word but it is actually general tso's know T the T is silent so just a little tip for you next time you order it
