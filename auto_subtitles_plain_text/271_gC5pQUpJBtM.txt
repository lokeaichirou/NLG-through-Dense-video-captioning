 when I think of French cuisine I think of the beef bourguignon so I'm very excited that chef de Mia is to be taking a 3-1 today it's slow cook but worth the wait it's now so we start with a special piece of beef okay you you put salt and you have to check your job you have to choose some special piece of beef force you or are you so like a check state so now you put on a cot very important little bit of Euler okay okay the boiler is very very odd stuck to to smoke okay I can see that and now now I'm on the wooden box don't don't stir aye aye aye so we can start stirring once it's round a little bit so now your meat is very Brown ok and now we put carrots crap at this components could they use so quite rough cuts of the vegetables because it's going to be a slow cooked meal but two or three oils or now it's very long from cooking so like this so now five minutes to run the onion and carrots okay on a very high heat yes five minutes okay very great we put flour is a to make the sauce begin yo ok ok and look is very visual to be white and we put tomato concentrate too much so that's the matter tra yes for the color under the taste on the acidity of the of the recipe ok yeah we put time and Loria ok like this like a bouquet garni ok if you have a Percy blur for the cook hope you put this ok so there's worse talks of costly yes and now five minutes more ok to cook the flour like home now you see that Munson debate there's a little paste that's formed at the bottom with all the house flower and smarter puree and that's really gonna help when we add the wine to make the sauce the boogie know this is very important ok no you put red wine strong with work red wine I could bog on the wine ok we put garlic and the pepper okay the water people on kick it down like the peppercorns in whole we don't grind them you and the say like the garlic so afterwards we're going to put the whole source through a sieve and get rid of the time stalks and the garlic cloves anything like that so now you boil maybe five minutes the wine because it is not to be too strong okay you have my boy oh boy oh boy without this one time cut the lead on boiling without our get five minutes in five minutes we put the lid on and you cook very very very slowly very slowly during two or three oils that's the time for patients are beef bourguignon is just bubbling away in the corner there so we're going to start with the garniture very easy because it just I'm to be put in a little bit of oil mm-hmm I put the lat long so we kick the bacon on a high heat I have a mushroom I couldn't fall oh just cut them into fourth nice fake mushrooms staying with the rustic style of the whole dish but mourinho is wrong chu is a brand Raghu so you are still up the gallery true Samira wrong ok Dorrian bottoms so need the color to come out in the garniture it's well cook a very long long long yeah just the piece of diff to tell me french is d County ok so we're just fishing out the pieces of beef leaving all the vegetables and hurt no you pass the sauce boogie oh I don't password and i'll stop all the herbs garlic and other things which i wanna heat we add the garniture on the top of the ball you know like this under buff baggage I was finished I didn't know it took this long to cook but we're really treating ourselves so below 80
