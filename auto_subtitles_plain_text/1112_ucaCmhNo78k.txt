 so my oven is preheating to 350 degrees I'm going to mix up my hash brown casserole in the 9 by 13 pan which is what it's going to be baked in because I don't have a big enough bowl to mix everything so this does make kind of a lot so be forewarned I'm going to add in one can of cream of chicken soup I've seen some recipes online call for cream of mushroom soup it is not cream of mushroom it is cream of chicken and to this I'm going to add a quarter of a cup which is half a stick of melted margarine you can use butter if you so choose however cracker-barrel does not at that end next tip is my cheese this is two cups of Colby cheese that has been put into the food processor and chopped up fine it is an 8 ounce block of Colby cheese almost all the recipes I've seen online call for cheddar and Cracker Barrell does not use cheddar they use Colby which is why a lot of times it does not taste exactly like cracker barrels it may be close and it may be very good in its own right but what we're going for is actual cracker barrels hash brown casserole same thing goes for sour cream a lot of the recipes call for sour cream Cracker Barrel does not put sour cream in there so I'm not going to in mind next up is half of an onion that has been diced up and then finally if you want this more like Cracker Barrel you're going to add more salt than I do but I add half a teaspoon to this there's plenty enough salt in the soup too as well as the cheese to salt everything but and then 1/2 a teaspoon of black pepper now I'm just going to mix this up until it's well combined now that this is all mixed up I'm going to add in my hash browns I'm using frozen shredded hash browns that have been thawed you don't use frozen and I'm going to use two pounds of hash browns unfortunately these bags come in 26 mm size so I'm going to use one full bag and about a handful of potatoes out of another bag and I'm going to do something that they even do in the restaurant make sure you have clean hands and just mix this up until all of the hash browns are covered with your sauce mixed well and once you get that all mixed up go ahead and wash your hands make sure you pat it out in a leaving even layer you don't want to mash this down you don't want to compress it just leave it kind of loose but make it take up the entire pan and now I'm going to put this in my preheated oven again 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 to 50 minutes just until it starts bubbling and starts to get a nice crust around the edge and when that time is up I will be back and after it comes out of the oven this is what it will look like you want to go ahead and let this rest for about 10 minutes or so before you dive into it if you really want it like Cracker Barrell go ahead and let it sit for a half hour 45 minutes and it'll get to be the exact consistency of cracker burroughs hash brown casserole but anyway that is how you make a hash brown casserole Cracker Barrel style hope you guys enjoy and thanks so much for watching you
