 hey folks today's video is about scrambled eggs the way I prepare my eggs now is a little bit different than I did a few years ago everybody's used to you know mom and pops eggs so it's a little bit chunkier a little bit more rustic this is a sort of a refined way of making scrambled eggs with the addition of creme fraiche whisking vigorously to make almost sort of like a fluffy custard esque type scrambled egg I learned this technique at Bouchon along with many other recipes I love that restaurant Thomas Keller is such an idol to me he's really really a great American chef that represents French cooking and sort of fun events behind that hopefully this video teach you guys how to scramble eggs and a different light a different perspective on how you can sort of manipulate a product or an ingredient to your liking and you can you can always you know omit things that I put in these recipes or even add things one add cheese or our different herbs or you know a cream or different kind of butter or whatever you want you can I mean it's really all up to you guys I just want to really share my techniques with you guys more than this the specifics of the ingredients that's that's really why I made this channel so hopefully you guys enjoy this video so following along and making these awesome scrambled eggs so as you all know I do love chives and most of my recipes are at least most my savory recipes but I'm going to start off with a little bit of butter in my pan and then add my two eggs and start whisking vigorously just so it doesn't clump up and I so I can get that really nice custard texture it's where you'd be so about halfway through the cooking process you're going to want to add all your ingredients which are the chives creme fraiche salt and pepper and then continue whisking on a medium to high heat you know my M goes so after about three to five minutes on medium heat and vigorous whisking your eggs should be ready they should have a nice creamy texture to them but have sort of a bouncy touch to them when you plate also I want to serve this dish with a side of awesome sourdough buttered toast I just can't live without that with my scrambled eggs that's good time and if I'm ni a you know where to find me close your eyes and sing and we'll be free number
