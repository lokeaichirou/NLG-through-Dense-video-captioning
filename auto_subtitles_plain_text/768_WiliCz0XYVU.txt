 hi guys so today I'm going to be teaching you how to make pasta e fagioli this is a copycat of Olive Garden's recipe and it is delicious to start off with you're going to need 1 pound of sweet Italian pork sausage that is already browned and cooked 4 cups of chicken stock 1 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes I'm using the Italian style 1 15 ounce can of tomato sauce 1 tablespoon oregano 1 teaspoon of thyme 1 cup of chopped carrots 1 cup of chopped celery one cup of chopped onions 1/4 cup of olive oil there cloves of minced garlic 1 15 ounce can of dark red kidney beans 1 15 ounce can of light red kidney beans 1 15 ounce can of great northern beans and 2 cups are slightly undercooked Italy new pasta first set your heat to medium and then get a big pot and dump your 4 cups of chicken stock in it next take your can of tomato sauce and dump it in the pot and I like turns my can out with water and dump that water into the pot as well add your diced tomatoes to the pot and then add your 1 pound of ground pork sausage next add your 1 tablespoon of oregano and 1 teaspoon of thyme to your pot after all of your ingredients are in the pot give it a good nice stir and then you're going to saute the carrots onion celery and garlic and another pan on medium heat so add all of these ingredients and add some olive oil and you're just going to saute these for about five minutes or until the onions are nice and translucent after your carrot celery onion and garlic are all sauteed you're going to add them to your big pot of soup and you're going to want to stir this and then cover it with a lid and you're going to want it to simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the celery are nice and tender after the 15 to 20 minutes is up remove the lid and add your beans you're going to want to rinse and drain these beans out of the can and then you're going to add in your pasta and again this should be slightly undercooked so that way when you add it into your really hot soup it cooks it just a little bit more but it doesn't get the pasta to soggy so just stir it up until it's nice and mixed so there you have it a nice huge pot of pasta e fagioli I'm not trying to brag or anything but I do think that this recipe is actually a little bit better than Olive Garden's so if you like this video I want to see more recipes hit subscribe below hit thumbs up and let me know in the comments below if you try this recipe and how you liked it alright guys thanks so much for watching bye
