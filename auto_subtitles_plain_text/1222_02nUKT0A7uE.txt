 in my first video recipe I will be showing you how to make one of my favorite meals miuna schnitzel this happens to be the most Austrian as you can try and I highly recommend you try if you get a chance for this recipe you'll need some meat which I'll talk about in a second some salt and optionally some pepper about 2 cups of breadcrumbs 2 cups of all-purpose flour does something you have in your pantry nothing too fancy and three to four eggs depending on the size and also some large we use something similar to concentrated butter but lard or a good quality oil can also be used for high efficiency I recommend you set up three stations using two sheets of aluminum foil and a deep plate begin by whisking the eggs in the deep plate and lightly seasoned with some salt then transfer both the flour and the breadcrumbs to the two aluminum sheets now season the meat for this recipe we use turkey meat however traditionally either veal or pork could be used lightly seasoned salt and if you like a little bit of pepper now you can take the meat and completely cover it with the flour dust off any excess and then immediately dunk it into the whisk eggs again the NEX excess drip off and then transfer to the breadcrumbs you'll want to ensure that the meat is completely and evenly covered in the breadcrumbs and I find this is easiest if you use your fingers to really pop the breadcrumbs into the meat then transfer the breaded meat onto plate and continue doing the same with the rest for the full recipe you can visit my blog health inspirations net where I have the recipe including the exact quantities I'll have a link to my blog and all my social media channels in the information bar below so check that out if you're interested when you're done breading the meat you can heat up the lard in a large deep pan make sure not to heat up too high otherwise you'll burn the meat a good way to test whether the large or the oil is hot enough is to simply sprinkle some of the dry breadcrumbs into the oil and when they start sizzling you can start frying the meat fry the schnitzel for about four to five minutes on medium heat until a dust golden and then carefully flip over on to the other side try not to splatter oil over a kitchen fry for another four minutes on the other side transfer the schnitzel onto a plate covered with a few layers of kitchen roll to prevent a big puddle of oil from forming whilst you're cooking the rest of the meat you can transfer the cooked schnitzel to a preheated oven which will ensure that they stay warm and crispy we usually serve schnitzel with butter parsley potatoes and a preserve made from cow berries which might be a bit hard to find outside of Europe by ketchup is a really good cut substitute and force them by the mins we like having a side salad on this particular day we had a salad from the garden with some radishes I hope you enjoyed this video and for more recipes and more live stunts by our posts make sure to visit my blog
