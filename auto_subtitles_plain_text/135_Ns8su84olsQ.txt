 today we're gonna learn how to make one of the most popular Thai dishes and one of my favorites Pad Thai and here to teach us how is none other than Food Network's chef jet Tila from battling Chef Morimoto on Iron Chef America to guiding Anthony Bourdain through LA's Thai town on No Reservations chef jet Tila is not only celebrated for his expertise on modern Asian cuisine but also recognized as the first-ever chef to represent his country's culture and cuisine in the United States Bangkok market was the first time market 1972 was 40 years ago believe it or not it wasn't even born yet I got to see the tech community grow up around me and I got to be an integral part of it and thanks to my parents you know I'm just kind of I'm carrying the torch that they stir well this is why we had to have you today to learn how to make pad thai now let's talk about Thai food in general what makes up Thai food so there's a three-letter word that sums it all up and that's why um that's young yeah and all that means is all Thai ingredients will fall into four flavors hot sour salty and when you balance all those flavors perfectly that's the YUM that's like taste nirvana so I'm gonna teach you how to make the pad thai sauce which is the perfect example of yo all right let's start with a familiar flavor which is sweet and now you've got sugar there so to that base you have three acids lime juice tamarin or rice vinegar what is salmon I think a little taste here I'll do this so it would be food safe today and sour it's a clean salaries right yeah we're lime juice might be slightly sour and bitter tamarins a very straight clean sour okay so go forth all right although tamarind right in there if you had just tamarind you'd be fine if you had just lime juice we had just vinegar but I like what the little flavor Barings is each one's great okay we have three left you definitely left so we have to go salty stop fish sauce in Thailand Thai we call it numb plah and fill in tagalog it's it's but these two etcetera all it is guys is it's Thailand's version of soy sauce and if you can't get fish sauce okay how's that okay look now we have a fork in the road we eat it's spicy and time so for spicy sriracha sauce if you don't like spice do a little paprika and if you like spicy spicy or not alright girl throw that in there stir that around and you've just made pad thai sauce now is this something that you can do ahead of time you can do this way ahead of time and I tell you what you can be very chef e multiply that by two three five or ten and they just put in a squirt bottle and you've just made your own pad thai sauce refrigerator all right so it's cooking time that's cooking time so I got my wok hot always pre get your walks a little bit know someone doesn't have a wok yeah the wok is great because the heat is centered at the bottom and whenever you strip these around they fall back to the middle so if you don't have a wok you don't need one everyone has a Dutch oven nowadays you have those really fancy you know enamel eyes the cast iron okay that's super sexy or just a pan with high sides soil and I promise I promise never to use olive oil never to use olive oil needs a huge tip I like olive oil but the flavor clashes with kind of the Asian flavors anything you know garlic so I'll throw that right in there right a dried shrimp pretty intense that it's only delicious and food really delicious it's a little dried shrimp in there and then here I do want you to taste this this is pickled radish oh yeah good isn't it alright so um proteins now we're in protein bill and again I have four proteins you don't need four proteins you can pick one to whatever you got on hand but tofu is easy you can probably much fine tofu everywhere right a little chicken breast is going in and you like shrimp right yeah alright and you're gonna do the eggs now chef have you seen ingredients in a pad thai that you think are absolutely absurd that some people do and you kind of want to set the record straight kills me when I see ketchup oh it's kind of red it's gotta be ketchup no stop using ketchup here will juice the okay so check this out here's the cool technique now I don't want like super scrambled eggs to watch I just kind of break the yolks oh and I push things against like the side and I'll let the eggs and a dominate and so as it starts to coagulate yeah so we need to talk about noodles okay yes what kind of noodles are we using so you want to use rice stick noodles okay that's the best kind of noodle if you've ever eaten Vietnamese food there's a dish called BA say nu ba noodles pad thai noodles are the same they either come dry or they come semi like semi fresh like fresh pasta by the dry stuff soak it in warm water until feel that and you can help me describe with that - al dente I like that very al dente right so you fold all those together so and then tongs are really nice to it this so what we're looking for in the pan is the protein to be done about half way too little all right so the shrimp should be a little pink huh the chicken should be almost done absolutely and the noodles are gonna go from al dente - almost like cooked now it's time to go to sauce oh it is oh this smells fantastic the sauce is hit the pan it's starting to caramelize the sugars are actually reacting they're getting nice and sweet they're making you stick together and now we're gonna do some veggies so I'm gonna show you a really cool trick bean sprouts tend to scorch right with direct heat so we're gonna steam them slightly we leave a little bit for the plate okay and then scallions same thing and I want you to just kind of fold or make a little bit sweet and sprout you're doing perfect so that's so the residual moisture in heat is encasing it and saving it you got it and then with that little noodle mist I'm gonna give you half the peanut I'm looking at the sauce in the pain right and I want I don't want a pool so yeah and that's all it's called reduction right so I'm just reducing the sauce I'm cooking up the moisture out of it and now you'll just roll it around pull it together and you just may pad thai just industry I can't believe that just that it's really simple recipe and you see all the little bowls and you just wonder okay is that it doesn't actually take less than 10 minutes and it does I'm gonna show you how to plate this up because you know we eat with our eyes food should live sexy you know it's that's it I only serve sexy food at my party better only sexy food of your party so I'm gonna plate this kind of cheated to one side here see I'm kind of going to one side leaving a little like bare area so this is this is one serving right that's one of your servings right I know you don't have to share it target I want you to take this and plaster to get decided maybe push it in a little bit and then I want you to find a little zone next to the scallion and it right there and then I'll take the peanut just going to overtime ah and voila are you kidding you are awesome go for it go please alright cheers Cheers hmm so it's that balance mm-hmm of hot sour salty sweet yes the noodles is perfect carrier a little pungent from the scallion I could eat a whole bowl of this and it was so easy to me all right chef thank you so much this is the perfect Pad Thai and thank you for watching I'm brandy we'll see you next time on pop sugar
