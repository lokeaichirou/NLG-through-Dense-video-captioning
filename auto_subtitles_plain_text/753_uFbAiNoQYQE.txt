 I'm Claire Harrison qvs Development chef today I'm going to show you how to make perfect mash so here we have some potatoes these potatoes are bought specifically for mashing they're Ammar phoner potato but there are lots of other varieties you can use we start by giving the potatoes a thorough thorough wash it's very important when using dirty potatoes that you really do wash them and wash all the surfaces that potato has come into contact with okay we're going to peel the potatoes then I'm going to cut them into not too small chunks because it'll take on too much water but cut them into quarters chance about that size all evenly sized so they all cook at the same rate I'm going to pop them into a pan and add cold water so salt a little bit of salt we'll have to taste and adjust the seasoning when we're making the mash but always put them in salted water cover them and bring them to the ball very very slowly until until the bubbles just break the surface and then we simmer very gently until they're just tender for everyday eating I would put a very small knob of butter in and a little bit of warm milk but today I think are feeling indulgent so we're going to add we're going to add a lot more butter a little bit of double cream and some whole milk and of course salt and pepper so we're going to have a look and see if these are cooked the easiest way is to get a knife and just put the point of the knife in the potato and it should go in very easily which it does drain them thoroughly careful not to splash then pop them back in the pan and then we're just going to put the lid back on leave them there for a couple of minutes in the meantime I'm going to take this milk I'm going to heat this milk up it's absolutely essential that the milk is the same temperature as the potatoes when you add it otherwise it makes the starch go cold and it gives you lumps in your mashed potato right so we've got our hot milk here boiling milk here and our potatoes now they've really dried out beautifully take our potatoes let's fill a dress this over it goes this is the gadget I prefer it's called a potato press it makes a great smooth mash so you put some potato in and then knob of your butter squeeze it through so it starts to incorporate in with your mashed potato that last couple of seconds where you put the lid on and leave the potatoes to dry out really important it's hitting here they're they're really dry and fluffy and with a knob of butter remember this is a special treat mash it's not for every day this is not diet mash and with our trusty wooden spoon start just to draw the potato together and as you see because this is the right variety it draws together it almost looks like it's almost like pulling dough together it's a bit of milk it's a light with a little bit and with a spoon with some double cream actually to make a really indulgent mashed potato add clotted cream it's heaven tiny bit of black pepper not too much because you don't it to overpower the flavor of the potato mix pop it in ER yes give us a little bit of color I'm going to chop few chives which go very well with mashed potato voila you
