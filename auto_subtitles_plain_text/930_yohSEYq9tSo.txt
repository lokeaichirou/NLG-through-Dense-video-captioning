 hey folks so the other day I was invited to the world-renowned River cottage and went on their fishing courses which is really really cool we were like fishing by the sea for a few hours there's loads of us the first time ever fished in my life Alf was going to hook my ear but was a really cool experience and then we went back to River cottage and learnt how to prepare fish which was really cool too and while I was there I did a video collaboration and learnt how to make and this is no lie the best fish and chips in the world I have ever ever ever ever tasted and today I replicated it at home if you wanna watch the original video of me learning go check out and subscribe to river cottage channel but this is how I just made it and it is amazing we'll start off with a homemade chunky tartar sauce in a bar can buy the mayonnaise two chopped hard-boiled eggs capers some fresh dill that I chopped up a shallot that I chopped so nice and fine and half a lemon just to juice only give it a good mix together and that is the tartar sauce done next I made the squished peas with butter and mint so so good in a pan I poured in my peas with a little bit of water and just simmered them through for around about three to four minutes until they were cooked drain them off and dollop in my butter and mint turned off the heat and use the residual heat to just mix it through melt the butter and believe it or not all we want to do then is squish it with the back of a wooden spoon and that is done too for the beer batter for our fish all it did was grab a bowl plunked in our plain flour a little pinch of salt just to season it a little bit and gradually added in some beer whisking it add in a little bit more until it was nice and smooth and kind like the thick consistency of cream and if you've got any leftover I've got too much so like it's a good excuse to drink it up so just leave your batter to one side just for a minute for the chips I use Maris Piper potatoes here is the lifecycle so you've got an unpeeled one a peeled one and ones that I've sliced into chips they slice me the chips and tip them into a pan of simmering water for around about 90 seconds to two minutes and then just drain it off straight away for a colander while you empty your pan get a slightly larger one fill it with this sunflower oil and get it nice and hot fry their chips initially for five minutes until they just start to go Brown and then you should drain your own kitchen towel I didn't have any left so I tipped it through a colander into a pan and then shook them onto a tea towel and just dabbed it a little bit that worked out right and then cranked up the heat on the hog to get the oil a little hotter put the chips back in and cook them through until they're nice and golden-brown and repeated that draining off step so put it on a kitchen towel if not or I did mine for the Condor and tea towel style baby don't you fish into the pre-made batter and make sure it's nice and coated shaking off any excess and dump it straight into that pan where the chips have just came out of so the oil is nice and hot they want to cook it through for around about four or five minutes until it's nice and golden brown and then all you got to do then is plonk it on a plate and serve it all up it is looking amazing trust me that is so good oh my goodness guys when I first learned how to make this over at River cottage I said at the time it is the best fish and chips I've ever tasted which is a bold statement because I live by the sea here in the UK where fish and chips is super traditional but it's so much flavor in it I don't want to put any salt or any vinegar or ketchup anything like that so many flavor dimensions the tartar sauce is chunky I could just eat that as it is on its own we've got a buttery mini peas as well so so good so if you have a go at this recipe send me a picture @myvirginkitchen remember to check out the original video over on the river cottage channel of me learning how to make this and go subscribe too while you're there and I think it's only fair I eat all of this right now see you next time
