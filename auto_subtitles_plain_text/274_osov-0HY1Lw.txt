 [Music] hey foodies we're getting busy with a wonderful summertime treat this is all-american macaroni salad now I know a lot of people make macaroni salad all year round but I love to make macaroni salad with lots of color and some great texture so this way you get the creamy tangy dressing but you also get the crunch of some fresh vegetables and the pop of some really beautiful color now we have already chopped up most of our vegetables let me get this celery into its little bowl here and get that all ready to go we also want to make sure that we get our pasta from the refrigerator I love making my pasta ahead of time so that way I can get it cooled and get it ready to go because once you stop cooking the pasta we want to blanch it real quickly with some cold water so you can make sure it stops this cooking process and it's ready to add in once you get all your fresh ingredients prepared so we'll head over to the refrigerator grab our 4 cups of cooked pasta now I also like to toss this with a little olive oil because I think that keeps it from sticking together and makes it a lot easier to work with now the only thing we have left to do is to shred up some carrot so it's a great opportunity for you to get all those great wonderful farm-fresh vegetables we are in the height of some great great vegetables all year round now because you can really get great vegetables 12 months of the year in the summertime all those great wonderful farmer's markets start coming in with all their great vegetables so buy local get all your great vegetables and that makes every recipe that much nicer we're gonna add this in to our carrots and get busy to start assembling everything we need for all-american macaroni salad now we started with 4 cups of elbow macaroni that has already been cooked off and ready to go now we're going to add to that 1 cup of chopped red onion then we're going to jump in with celery this is 1 cup of chopped celery from there we go into your green garden peas now these are frozen but we've defrosted them and they're ready to pop inside and that's 1 cup of frozen peas then we're going to add 1/2 cup of this beautiful chopped red pepper those are really great for color then we're going to go in with 3 boiled eggs and then finally one and a half cups of deli ham diced tight and ready to go inside but don't forget that lasts a little bit of color all those grated carrots that we worked on this is going to come together for you and our carrots are one cup and you're ready to go with something that's really colorful and full of great texture so now we have half the macaroni salad made let's get busy on the dressing the dressing is really classic and so easy to make I love this dressing because it combines all the creaminess you're after plus the tang that your really love with macaroni salad now let's move our dry ingredients and the macaroni out of the way and get busy with our dressing now what we've already done is put the wet ingredients inside I'm a big fan of doing this from the start it really kind of speeds up the whole process what we have in the bowl already is our mayonnaise we've got half a cup one and a half cups of mayonnaise we also have sour cream there's 3/4 of a cup of sour cream and then of course you've got Dijon mustard there are two tablespoons and make sure you get that really wonderful fresh creamy Dijon mustard to give it that nice punch then we're going to add in our dry ingredients and our spices so let's get these over here as well what I also have to add a little extra Tang is some white vinegar this is three tablespoons of white vinegar add that in and that'll really give it a nice punch then beyond that we're going to add in our spices now we've got sugar also garlic powder there's also salt and celery seed one teaspoon of celery seed one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of kosher salt one teaspoon of ground pepper and a half tablespoon of garlic powder so we'll add all of that in and then we're going to get a whisk and give this a nice stir this is such an easy dressing I like to tilt the bowl a little bit to the side there and get a really nice whisk in there incorporating all those spices all of your wet ingredients and you can already start to smell how zesty and tangy this is going to be now what I'm going to do is add my black pepper last and there are a couple reasons for that one I want to make sure that I get it evenly distributed because you don't want that to clump up inside and I'm also going to make sure that I incorporate that up high when you add your spices up high you get more even coverage let's take this from our measuring spoon and just give a nice shake up high and get it evenly distributed then we'll whisk that back in so there's all of our pepper that all worked in and now for the hard part we're just going to add in the other ingredients not anything so hard about this at all so we'll take this to the side my hands wipe and start incorporating in all of these other ingredients remember all your dry ingredients go inside along with your pasta you're gonna give this one great big stir I like to call this recipe a dump and stir because it's so so easy you're just going to incorporate all the ingredients and then give it a nice stir but remember because those peas are now defrosted you want to incorporate this very gently there's no need to get into a hurry with this you don't want those Peas to break apart or to mush up that's a culinary term you may want to look it up so this is gonna be a perfect way for you to add color texture and wonderful Tang enus to really a classic American treat macaroni salad is something that we really can enjoy all year round but we tend to it make it and enjoy it more in the summertime perfect for backyard barbecues wonderful for holiday get-togethers and isn't it nice when you make it yourself sure you can go to a store might buy a premade but that's really not going to give it its homemade touch and when you add your own ingredients you know exactly what's going inside you know where you source them and you know right away that they're going to be perfect for everyone who gathers around your family picnic table so now the only thing left is to serve it up and enjoy let me grab a couple of bowls here I like working with shallow bowls when I serve this particularly this is going to be kind of the main event and get a nice big serving spoon nothing nicer than a big wooden serving spoon for a summertime meal and be generous with this this also keeps hurry and I say I've often found that this is even better the next day because all the flavors have had time to kind of marinate and complement one more for everybody at the table this is the perfect perfect accompaniment to go with any of your grilling items any of your summertime meals I always say make this ahead of time and let those flavors marinate and you'll come away with a colorful macaroni salad all-american colors and great texture for your next family get-together you
