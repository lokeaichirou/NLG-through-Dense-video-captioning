 [Music] okay by now I'm guessing you've noticed that we are from the great British soil and some of you have commented to say that we don't do enough good traditional British food which is why this week we're jumping straight in with a classic and that's fish and chips so we're gonna make our own chips twice fried and we've got some haddock and we're gonna put into my beer batter okay so this couldn't get any more British the first thing that is are chips so if you guys can or one of you people and one of you chip you're smoking clean up in a minute Jamie I'm just saying it's on the hop also need to get those Jamie yep now we want chips now for this one we're gonna go quite thin chips thin slices like this alright french fries really french fries clean against the point base part when you see when we twice find them you'll notice why we do that my case is a nice crispy chip you can leave some of the skin on if you want but for these I think it's even better if we take it all off while you're doing that I'm going to make our platter so it's just an all-purpose flour or a plain flour little bit of salt and the thing we're gonna make it with our a or your oils are very British very British drink stay on flat which one have you got there this is bishops finger I've had a few bishops finger in my time now here in the UK and we'll well no stupid a all names if you want to see more these razors main thing click on the description below I think to make my inspiration video you want a consistency is gonna stick to the fish so something like that it's still dripping but it's nice and thick and lump three important bits dripping bishops finger and they can go into our fryer basket out that's the chip remember the one I cut yep do if I set about the same size yeah well I have a size complex and I think they probably look closely so these are gonna go into our oil at 140 degrees okay we're gonna cook them twice that's not hot but oil that's quite cool you can do this just in their pan on the stove if you like okay just keep an eye on it never leave it unattended and they'll cook for about minutes meanwhile we can do our fish so the batter's there now there is one other secret ingredient a little bit of vinegar this in the batter in the better tablespoon or so and that's just enough to give it up crunch if you don't want to do beer you can't get hold of beer you can just use sparkling water it's nothing alternative those chips are probably cooked but no lift them out this shake get me an excess oil and then drain them off my kitchen roll this is one that's once cooked but see already pretty cooked okay nice people cooked okay fire up to 180 degrees okay because that's what we're going to cook our fish in and they'll just start actually battering the fish so this is haddock okay like sustainable fish you make sure you take it all the skin off and it's bone free seasoned flour and that's just gonna make the batter stick to the fish and then bears if you can just kind of swirl that around in there and that's the coach all the way around it's all coated and then drip it into the oil and just slowly lower it in so that it starts let's set the bathroom before you let go say me alone so the whole thing's coated slowly in the last minute and then give baths get a little bit more shape and it just stops leaking to the bottom so they need about five minutes then they can come out and the chips and go back in clips done been cool nice and crispy so all those out let them drain a little bit Wow very noisy dude nice crispy batter and then if our chips go blind in there Jamie yep because now it's the twice part of it and this will make a nice and crispy there we go so drop those down they will only need a minute maybe 90 seconds to crisp up meanwhile over this side we can start plating arrests now another classic British thing always perfect fish and chips in newtripper okay run it sorry I'll have a nice big bit of fish in there a more classic comes with a tartar sauce okay so that's mayonnaise capers gherkin nice wedge and lemon yeah and how those chips coming on Jamie this shouldn't need much longer I fink mate they are they're crispy crispy nice and crispy for in the kitchen well there we go nice spring of salt season this stays and it sticks with you old slightly smells of the seaside yeah I think that's smells and sounds so we'll stuff some of our chips in there yeah plenty inside yes so for everyone who was after something traditionally British it's our beer battered haddock and chips sorting there we go fish and chips yes four chip intercostals mmm good squeeze a lemon out of that fish I'm trying my fishes finger well I've amazing fresh fish fling that is what bring me the truth so from all of us in the UK here's a real seaside favorite toy
