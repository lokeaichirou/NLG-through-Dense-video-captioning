 hi I'm Diane cometa and today audition with dye I'm making Caesar salad this is a classic salad and the dressing Caesar dressing is really easy and it can be used for lots of other things so let me show you what you need and we'll get started today on dish and with dye you need some mayonnaise some freshly grated Parmesan cheese some lemon juice some wishes your sauce some olive oil Dijon mustard granulated sugar chopped garlic anchovy paste fresh ground black pepper and salt I also have some romaine lettuce here that I've washed and thoroughly patted dry and then chopped into bite-size pieces now it's important that you keep your romaine lettuce chilled before you serve it because if it sits out at room temperature too long after it's been cut then it can wilt a little bit so I'm going to set that aside make sure I get that back into the fridge the other thing that I have are my fresh homemade croutons so you can use you know store-bought if you want but these are really simple to make so I'm going to leave the link for this for you as well now this is a really super simple recipe it's just you know a lot of different ingredients here now I have a little mini food processor that I'm going to use for this if you don't have one you can use a blender you can use an immersion blender or you could try to do this by hand and I'll explain you know different things that you might have to adjust if you do it by hand now the one thing you might noticed is that there's no eggs in this which makes it really nice so if you have a problem with fresh eggs in your area you don't have to worry about it with this recipe now the first thing that I'm going to do is put my meanies into my little food processor really we're going to put everything in here so as I put things in all explain stuff to use and you could use either regular low-fat fat-free mayonnaise you know whatever you prefer just use a good good mayonnaise okay now the Parmesan cheese now I have fresh grated Parmesan cheese here and I actually grade it in my little mini food processor which makes it really easy because it's less expensive if you can buy it in the big chunk like that but if you want to buy it already grade it that's up to you but again make sure you get a really good brand now next I have some fresh lemon juice this is freshly squeezed if you don't have fresh lemons you can buy the bottled stuff in the store no problem with that a little bit of whish you share sauce all of the measurements are on my website dishing with DICOM so don't worry about that and that's where you find all my other recipes too now this is a little bit of olive oil just a little and again good brands good brands of everything whatever the best is that you can afford is going to make this taste you know better than it would you didn't buy good brands and this is Dijon mustard I just have a little bit here a little bit of sugar this is granulated sugar and the garlic now this is chopped now if you don't have a food processor or blender or any of the other things I mentioned then you might want to just take this and grate the garlic into the bowl that you're going to be mixing everything in because you don't want chunks of garlic like this in the salad it has to be you know very finely blended so I'm going to put this in here and it will get blended up well in here now next is the anchovy paste now I just want to show you that this is this is the brand that I picked up at the store and this is usually found on the shelf it's not refrigerated after you open it you have to refrigerate it but it's in a little tube like this now you could use fresh anchovies if you want to you just have to chop those up nice and fine I don't use anchovies all the time I used it in my shrimp bisque but so I don't really prefer to have fresh anchovies this works a lot better for me so you could leave this out completely if you want to but it really is what kind of gives Caesar salad that you know nice taste you you're not really aware of what it is that's making it taste so great anchovies so you could just kind of adjust how much you want in there but again if you don't want it just mix it so I'm going to put this in the fresh ground black pepper and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in there now not too much on the salt because if you're using the anchovy paste that's already a little bit salty now we're just going to take this and blend it up really well all right that was quick and easy now you can see the little flicks of pepper in there and you can see it looks like there's little lumps in it that's actually the cheese so this is you know what you usually see when you have Caesar salad dressing or Caesar dressing we should call it and what I usually do is make it a day or two ahead of time it actually tastes better if it at least sits overnight and it's one of those things after a couple days it just keeps getting better and better I'll usually keep it for about a week in an airtight container but I'm just going to put a little bit of dressing on here plus a few of those in there so crunchy just get everything well coated and now I'm just going to put this into my serving bowl just a little bit and that looks gorgeous I like a lot of dressing on there put some of those croutons on and what I like to do is maybe put like a couple extra ones on there that don't have anything on it and you could also put some more fresh ground black pepper on here if you want and I think it looks nice when you put like a few grates of the fresh parmesan like shred it like this over top how's that look nice that was so easy and now I got to give a little taste on those croutons one they're crunchy really delicious lots of flavor it does get better as it sits it tastes great right now but I would really recommend that you make this in advance the recipe is on my website edition with DICOM I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious we'll see you next time bye
