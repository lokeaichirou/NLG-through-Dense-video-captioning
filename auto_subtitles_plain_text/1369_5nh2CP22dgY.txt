 today I'm going to show you one of the ways I make shepherd's pie so a little bit of oil not too much got a nice hot pan there now what I'm going to do is I'm going to put about 500 grams of so it's gonna be this one I've been cooking this for just about just over 2 minutes now and what we can do is just if you need to thicken up a little bit just have a little bit of flour in there like so a little spoonful of that it just mix that all around and it would just help starting to thicken up so you've got a nice thick sauce ok the next stage put the onion in because it's been grated obviously it's not going to take that long to cook and we've got the garlic in just sort of mix that around and again do the same with the Terra see what a good selection of things it I mean obviously you can add things to say something you can add some peas in whatever you like so we get that within there give that a stir stir it up and cooking for nearly a minute just put a bit of you see our Worcester sauce leave parents or voiceless also put a good splash at aim and also want a bit of tomato puree so again we're just put a splodge of that give that a quick stir and you can always have it to taste I might just put a little bit more Puri in there see another good sport that had a bit of red wine don't go overboard and give that a good stir up now I'm also at this stage gonna add a bit of Rose Morean some time I've already got it sort of chops up they're quite fine so just gonna sprinkle that on gives it a nice flavor we don't need to cook this very long probably at the stage where really we can add a little bit of chicken stock just trying to make sure the red wines mixed in and there's no liquid sort of there red wine just get it all day you see it's looking a really good colour though I'm just gonna add a little bit of chicken stock I mean you can use lamb stock if you want but I'm just gonna use a bit of chicken stock I think it gives it a nice flavor just gonna stir that really on the low low heat I would say now for about a minute and just try and get that to thicken up nicely now we've got to start doing the mashed potato so that's gonna be my next stage so I just leave that cooking there and for about a minute and we're probably ready to go before I had them mashed potato into the pan things you want to try the the baits first and see what it's like mmm mine's good it's got all those the rosemary salt coming through okay back had just a tad more salt salt and pepper to my one and a tiny little bit of chicken stock extra I mean obviously the sauce than that you can have it as you like if you like it slightly thicker then do it as I've done it if you like it a little bit more runny like a grave you just add a little bit more chicken stock so that's ready to go now so we're going to put it into a little ceramic pot and then we're going to put the mashed potato on top I got new potatoes done and these are just sort of what white potatoes actually only potato though so we're just going to make them a plate I'm just cutting it up so that then I can sort of play some butter in there try and make it so really it sticks on the spoon when you lift the up so it's all mashed up you put your spoon in there it sort of hangs hangs there really that's how you want it you don't want it too runny otherwise it will just sort of disappear into the mints and stuff so I'm going to use the the mashing thing for that and just mash that up now I've got me mashed potato ready and you can see that it pretty much hangs on the spoon there if you give it but so that's nice thick mashed potato really so that's good now the other little ingredient which it's up to you whether you add or not but I mean I I really like it on there is a bit of Parmesan cheese grated Parmesan cheese so you can mix that in with the mash so we'll just give it a quick stir and the other thing again to add to this really is a little bit more salt I can do that to taste and add a little bit of pepper and then really we're ready to put the two together so I'll now show you you know just putting the two together and we're going to put it in the oven and it's the cook just pop the mince in here that's it and then we're gonna level that out a little bit and then simply just put the mashed potato over the top before we do it just gonna sneak a few peas in it just give it a bit of colour and the kids like the peas and stuff so I can get away with that so I just put the mashed potato on join spread it over so it sort of seals itself up really you get it right up to the edges and push it down so it's nicely on top got all the mash sorted out it's sealed up around the edges so that's nice now what I've got here is a little bit of grated cheese this is just normal mature sort of cheddar so you can just sprinkle some of that on top of there use a fork just to kind of rough this up a little bit and it gets some of the cheese in there as well because all these little fluffy bits you create they're the bits that go Brown and give it the effect so like that and again a little bit more cheese just a bauble on top now we're going to put this in the oven for about 20 minutes I'd say around about - 20 to 40 degrees so it looks Brown what you've got to remember it's all cooked we're just now browning off the top and making it look nice the last thing just to do is just dig it with a fork there like so and I think it just lets some of the steam out so it doesn't overflow so much so pop that like so ready to go in the oven I'm just gonna pull this out now I've actually left it a little bit longer so it's been in there about 20 to 23 minutes and you can see that you've got a nice sort of browned off top and let's have a look at it I'll put it on the table and serve a piece up let's have a look what's inside okay I've got the shepherd's pie there I'm just gonna make a little cut with a knife there to start with and then what I'm gonna do is just use a spoon here big spoon and serve this up I mean this is a that if you can see that but this is lovely and moist and you've got a nice sort of crispy coating on the top there and then what we can do is serve this up with a little bit of extra gravy if you want and maybe a few peas which is what I think I'll do okay I'm just gonna put a few peas alongside there like so and maybe a little bit of gravy just to finish it off and I might as well as always do the taste test I love the rosemary in it you can taste the time it's a really nice dish
