 what's going on guys it's Simon welcome back to the diet kitchen I am back with my good friends at masa food to bring another delicious recipe and it's a favorite of i'm hoping many of you because it's a big favorite of mine it is of course the grilled cheese sandwich i am going to be taking you through my personal ultimate way to make this the best possible grilled cheese sandwich you can and of course for the best macros possible because that's how we do things here isn't it so yeah just remember if you did like the video click that like button at the end and subscribe if you haven't already because I have loads and loads of recipes a lot probably in the hundreds yeah yeah without further ado let's start a recipe first thing is of course the bread now this recipe is completely adaptable to how you wants to customize it for your macros this would be the lowest calorie option possible that I'm making today so I'm using a low carb bread that's about 10 grams of carbs per slice or 20 grams in total and what you want to do is the first thing you want to do this is optional as well guys if you don't like mustard completely leave it out take some I'm taking English mustard here and just spread a thin layer on one slice of bread so if you don't like mustard guys you can use any kind of chutney you like a caramelized onion chutney or something like that will go amazingly with this but just more macros obviously because muscle is pretty much calorie free yeah damn right and then what we're going to go with next is the cheese so today I'm going with the new muscle food zero fat cheese yeah is the macros are amazing per 100 grams you've got 177 calories 2.2 grams of fat 11.7 grams of carbs and 28 grams of protein so damn damn good they've got mozzarella and the cheddar and we're going to go with a mix of both today there will be an offer to go along with this video limited time only to check that out in the description box below guys like I said complete adaptable if you can't find these kind of cheeses then use a lower fat cheese or full fat cheese use Gruyere if you like absolutely anything so what we're going to do take I have 30 grams for these slices of bread you might need to use more cheese for a different type of bread 30 grams of each to 60 grams in total in here to this we're going to add in a pinch of Oregon oh just about that much I'm going to add in an eighth of a teaspoon of smoked paprika some freshly ground black pepper in there too and then just give that a little stir together I would definitely recommend going with two types of cheese and matter what just gives more dimension and depth to the flavor and let's add this onto one slice of bread as you can see packed full of cheese so amazing us you know that starts going to mill out everywhere and be delicious and then what we're going to do you're going to take the other slice of bread and this is another key to an amazing grilled cheese is take a bit of butter I'm going for the low calorie kind today of course but use whatever kind you like butter is full of micronutrients guys there's a lot of calcium in there as well so don't be afraid to use butter you can brush on some olive oil if you like it's completely up to you and just spread that really feeling you don't want to go heavy on that and this is actually going to be pretty outside of a grilled cheese sandwich perfect and then let's move over to our pan area alright so this is a dry pan there's nothing in it at all we're going to put it on to a low heat so like that much you want it quite low you want to cook it low and slow and let's wait for that to heat up okay that's nice and hot and we're going to place it butter side down so that the side that we buttered earlier just push that down in the pan a little bit let's butter the other side a little bit now now we're going to place a lid on top so it helps steam and melt the cheese without burning the bread and we're going to leave that for about a minute and then we'll check under the other side to see how is toasted okay so it's ready to flip look at that that is amazing give it a little press down on this side and then we've got another minute on the other side and then we're done all right I've just checked underneath and it's done so let's head over to our chopping board and see that melted goodness well let's cut into the middle yeah that's using out nicely right it's perfect cool I'm gonna get stuck in you can see like the little mustard as well beautiful all right I'm gonna get stuck in guys let's wrap up the video show you the macros and I'll take that taste as well here is the beauty itself I can't wait to try this so good so nice those flavors just go just work all of them work perfectly together are some chutney in there as well anything you want like guys the butter on that outside makes the bread so crispy but yet just in front of it the bread stays really soft and then you just got that gooey melted cheese and no the cheeses like the best feet in the world yeah i really hope you try this recipe guys and let me know what you think if you did like the video remember to click that like button
