 everyone I'm marine and welcome to my kitchen and another episode of what's for dinner I recently showed you how to make a carne asada marinade and now we're going to make the carne asada we're going to marinate this it's early in the day and I'm going to marinate these all day and then Rick's going to throw these on a really hot grill and they're going to take no time at all to cook this is thinly sliced sirloin tip okay you can see what that looks like and there's one two three four there's six slices here and what we're going to do is we're going to take this meat we're going to put it in a ziplock bag this is just my preferred method of marination because it's quick it's easy and it's convenient and it has easy cleanup so you can do this in a glass container you can do it in a plastic container you can do it do not do it in aluminum container and then I also have some of the I squeezed some citrus to put in my marinade and I'm going to go ahead and put the the shells right in here with the meat and I'm going to rip some of these oranges up because they're kind of big and I'm going to put all of these in here because that way I get maximum flavor for my money and this marinade if you haven't watched this video yet I'll put a link below to where you can go and watch it we're just going to pour this right over I am going to remove as much air as possible from the bag and then just give this a good massage and get all of those flavors really incorporated and get that marinade nestled right in there with all that meat and those citrus shells get those incorporate in there don't be afraid your bag is not going to break just you know try really hard not to break that seal if you do then you know you're going to clean up a little bit that's all all right so what we're going to do now is we're going to just seal this up we're going to put it in the fridge until it's time to grill and when it's time to do that we'll be back and we'll show you what Rick's gonna do with them hey it decided to rain so we're going to go ahead and sear these off inside and you know carne asada traditionally done on the barbecue but you know today just didn't make it so I have my skillet it is smoking hot I sprayed it with some oil through and these aren't going to take any time to cook I'm not kidding they're going to take like two minutes just like that see look at that's nice you'll be able to tell when it's time to flip it because it'll easily release from the bottom of the pan it's almost there and also you'll be able to see it almost finished cooking on this side as well so I'm going to go ahead and turn it look at that that is beautiful we're going to let that sear off on the second side I'm going to set it off so on a different plate I'm going to finish cooking the rest of these off and then we're going to come back and I'm going to show you what happens next hey we have completed the cooking of all of those pieces of meat and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you how you cut it up because you're going to want to chop this so that it looks like this okay um so it's easier to eat inside of kako so just wipe up a bit okay my tongs this is my jag normos you know serial killer knife that I hardly ever use but this is one instance where you can use your butcher knife so rejoice if you have a butcher knife and you've never really used it okay grasp it firmly by the handle like this okay and then what you're going to do is we're going to make several chops all the way down and don't worry if it doesn't cut all the way through because we're going to chop right back and then we're going to turn it and we're going to chop the other way so we chop it in tiny little pieces okay and this may or may not be how you do it if you are authentic Mexican and you have you know you are an expert at making carne asada that's fine then you know I'll be at your channel and I'll be looking at how you do things but this is how I do them in my house I grew up in in Arizona 30 years so you know this is how we do it because it's quick and it's easy and it's delicious so here we go then we gather them up we turn the other way and chop in the other direction you see any really big pieces you can just hit him with your foot butcher knife and go from there and then you just add them to the rest of the chopped and there you have a plate with two delicious concord carne asada tacos and they have the works there's a little peek of the guy oh there's a little homemade guacamole there's some lettuce and green onions some Mexican cheese and then on the side here we have I was gonna make refried beans but I just got too busy and making everything else and I forgot so we have a little guacamole salad here with some shredded lettuce some homemade guacamole a little tomato a little onion and little dollop Daisy on the top so there you have it homemade carne asada tacos even if it rained we didn't get rained out they're really really awesome on the grill they're really really awesome in the house and make sure after you chop your meat that you salt it well because this meat loves to be seasoned so I hope that you try this and I hope that you really really love it because it's delicious you can find the recipe on my website that's Noreen's kitchen calm and I thank you so much for stopping by my kitchen this evening and
