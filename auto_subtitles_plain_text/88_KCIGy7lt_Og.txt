 hey there welcome back to no recipe required hope you're doing well tonight I'm going to make some homemade pizza for you this is going to be a classic margherita pizza it's really delicious pretty easy to do you've got your you know we've got our standard sauce the sauce that I normally make we'll roll out some pizza dough or stretch out some pizza dough and really just do a basic tomato mozzarella and basil basil crust I actually call it the Christmas because it's got a nice little red white and green coloring to it let's uh let's go ahead get started for our margarita pizza one of the few decisions you got to make is how thin or thick you want to cut your tomato or slice your tomato i am i actually prefer to go a pretty thin slice but if you really like kind of chunkier pieces of tomato by all mine by all means go a little thicker i'm going to go and you know probably do a I don't know an eighth of an inch or a sixteenth of an inch slice that are pretty thin and just lay them down i'm using a roma tomato which in winter i think is generally you know kind of the best out there but use obviously whatever's available whatever's fresh and whatever you like so let's go ahead and make our margarita pizza I've got a pasta dough that I just rolled out or kind of pulled apart pulled apart is not the right word I pulled in kind of stretched it out got a got a nice flat dough here you can you can find how I do it out on the website and then I've also got my basic or classic tomato sauce or pizza sauce that i use for just about all my pizzas and i'm going to go ahead and lay that down in a you know a nice coating i like you know probably a frankly i probably like a medium amount of sauce people people have said a little bit less a little bit more I kind of like it a little bit right in the middle use the back of the soon spoon there yeah you spoon it out with the front then just kind of use the back spread it out it certainly does not have to be perfectly even all around if you got little spots like that it's really not a big deal and then I like to use our leave about half an inch all the way around the pizza you don't want to you don't want to get any big massive puddles in there if you've got you know half an inch of of sauce sitting over here definitely you want to smooth that out so margarita pizza I've got some mozzarella cheese this is actually burrata cheese which is a kind of a version of mozzarella I'm going to go ahead and lay this down a few pieces kind of interspersed throughout the throughout the slice or throughout the pizza and these are you know these are probably quarter inch half an inch slices then I'm going to spread out maybe we fit one more in there how about this guy right there and maybe one more one more right in the middle there and then sauce a little bit that mozzarella and then you can lay some some basil down now the basil I like to I like to press down a little bit to make sure that it stays down stays down as it cooks if it stays down it it's less likely to burn in the oven which which I don't really like burnt basil so go ahead and you just kind of push it a little bit get it into the right places you know obviously tear up the leaves if you need to that looks good let's go ahead and pop this in the oven so in the interest of full disclosure I put my margarita pizza together without putting any fresh tomatoes on it which is not what I want to do I had actually already put it in the oven when I realized it I spotted the tomatoes not a big deal you just grab it onto the oven and let your tomatoes down there nobody's going to know that they went on late let me just pop that right back in the oven and we should be good to go in a few minutes so here's my pizza margherita just pulled out of the oven I actually kept it on the pizza stone that say that's something I normally do and let it actually cool down on this I find that keeps the the crust nice and crispy and you know this one I'm if you can tell on camera but you do like that the top kind of jiggles a little bit totally fine totally normal just means it needs to rest calm down solidify a little bit but I've got a perfect little pizza here hope you make it and i'll see you next time on no recipe required
