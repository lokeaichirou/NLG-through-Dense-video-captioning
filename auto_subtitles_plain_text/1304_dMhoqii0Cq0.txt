 today I'm going to show you guys how to make one of my favorite toasties now it's loosely based on the classic french problem sure I think life's a little bit too short to be baking bechamel or a toastie so I'm going to speed that up a little bit we've got a bit of creme fraiche some Dijon mustard it's a lovely cheese and we're gonna use that through the bechamel so the first thing we're gonna do is combine these three in a bowl a little bit of creme fraiche these young mustards we've got some lovely Briere that we've already grated so good handful of that in there it's gonna mix that to combine - this is our bechamel replacement that's all combined there we don't really need to season that doesn't cheese has got enough tang to it it's a lovely sourdough I'm just going to spread this mixture on the sourdough put some of this beautiful primo double smoked leg ham on there we're gonna toast that off just spread this mixture onto the bread be nice and generous because you want the loads of cheese in this we're doing two layers one for the bottom which will put the ham on and then one on the top which is gonna bubble and what to put in the oven and it'll crisp up with a gorgeous so nice and generous now this is the Primo Pam and I really love this stuff so he's to be super generous with that layer and arm okay so we've got the ham on there just lay this other piece straight on the top like that we want this all melting and gold and I'm just going to give a tiny bit of salt now bit of butter into a medium pan as soon as that starts to bubble up we're gonna pop our sandwich straight in now the idea is we're going to start the cooking process here it's going to get nice and brown on the bottom that butter is going to give it a lovely flavor once it's brown we're gonna pop that into an oven for about eight minutes and that's going to get warm through crispy and crunchy on the top and then we have one of my favorite toasty prop takes a couple of minutes for that now this toasty is beautiful and golden on the bottom I've got it in an ovenproof griddle pan just transfer that to the oven it's on medium and we're gonna pop that in there for about eight minutes bring it out it's gonna be all beautiful and golden and we're gonna be ready to rock and roll okay spend about eight minutes now I'm gonna pull this out of the oven yeah that is gooey and bubbly and gorgeous so a good tip and I've learned this the hard ways if you put a tea towel over the handle with that when you go to grab it again you won't burn your hand off so keep that in mind now this toasty is looking pretty damn good and bring that over and see that cheese is all melted the hams nicely warmed through we're just going to cut that top that on plates and that is all you need to do they go it's my favorite toasty with the Primo double smoked leg hand you
