 hi guys today I'm going to show you two ways to cook none at home without a tandoor oven you will need 340 grams of flour 1/2 TSP of salt 190 mils of water now this is lukewarm water a teaspoon of sugar a teaspoon of yeast 2/3 of a cup of plain yogurt and two and a half tablespoons of oil now put all of these ingredients in the description bar so check that out now into the water at the yeast and the sugar and gently stir until the sugars dissolved and then set it to one side in a warm place for about 1/2 hour and what we're looking for here guys is that froth on top now add in your oil d yogurt the flower and the salt and mix it all together well now you can use a mixer or a bread maker for this or you can just use your hands so once it's mixed give it a good knead until that dough smooth and then place it in a lightly oiled tub and cover it and set it aside in a warm place for about two hours to rise so the dough's ready to go as you can see it's tripled in size so I'm cutting it into four portions to make for nine and then simply just spread it out with your fingertips into the shape that you want it's a very soft dough very easy to work with now I've got the barbecue preheated to 250 degrees Celsius nice and hot indirect cooking of course use your oven if you like and then bake it for about 12 minutes or so is all it will take then simply cover with a bit of butter and they're done now the second cooking method is just as easy get a barbecue flat plate or your frying pan inside cover with some butter put on the naan it only takes about 2 to 3 minutes per side until it's golden brown and this is what you get as you can see it's beautiful and soft so nothing else to do now but try some so I've got some vindaloo here just tear off a bit of that nine bit of curry on the naan and digging guys and that is absolutely beautiful now there are many different flavors of nine out there so drop me a comment below and tell me your favorite flavor of nan be sure to check out my other videos and subscribe for regular updates thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time
