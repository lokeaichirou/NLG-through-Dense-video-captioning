 hi everyone I'm Simon I'm going to show you today how to make inside-out roll sushi roll with some spicy tuna red pepper it's a tinned tuna straight out of a can so there's nothing wrong in it and it's been mixed with some chili paste and little mayonnaise to give us some flavor and it goes fantastically well on an inside-out roll starting with fresh sushi rice here the layers across the middle of this seaweed which is down on the mat ready to go move the rice evenly across the whole expanse of the seaweed you don't press too hard otherwise you'll find that it turns into something that resembles mashed potato so move it nicely across cover the whole sheet nice and even I call it moving rather than actually pressing so you're moving the rice across once it's nice a nice layer you're just going to take some mustard seeds and sprinkle on the outside just because they've got a flavor and a little bit of color onto the outside with a texture then I take my sushi roll that's ready to flip onto its back and I lay on the tuna it's probably better to use a spoon initially there a nice amount in the middle flattened out so that we can you will see why in a moment using a spoon probably keep your fingers a little bit cleaner although I am wearing gloves then I'm taking some fresh red peppers which I've cut and I'm laying across the middle of the tuna now very carefully I lift at one end holding the ingredients and to nipping and tucking to the end leaving a little bit of an overlap so that I can a little space to close the roll lift it off and roll what's last time give it a squeeze square it off remove the bamboo mat and you have the roll ready to cut just keep it not to ijen square it off then with a very sharp japanese-style knife cut the roll into the center once I roll a knife back two sides together and do the same in the middle and on either side this way we're going to get eight pieces now to the roll which is just about the right size then bring on the side and let onto your serving dish and then you can see that the peppers should end up in the middle and that's a lovely strategy roll no or fish there for you and delicious
