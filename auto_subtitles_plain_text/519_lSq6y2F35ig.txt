 I'm Gironda welcome to foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to make this Waldorf salad now this salad was first presented at the New York City Waldorf Astoria Hotel between 1893 and 1896 so it's a really classic fruit salad that's been around for a while to get this salad started you're going to need a large red skinned apple as you can see right here I've cored it and I've cut it and dice sized pieces as you can see here I've got a half of a cup of pecans now this recipe originally calls for walnuts but I've slightly roasted a half a cup of pecans because I'm out of walnuts today and it's okay to put whatever nut you'd like also I have a half a cup of sliced celery and a half a cup of red grapes that these are sliced now if you don't have red grapes go ahead and use about 1/4 of a cup of raisins that will do the trick I have 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise if you'd like to use yogurt that would be great or even if you have sour cream you may substitute yogurt or sour cream here for the Mayo I have 1 tablespoon of lemon juice 1/4 of a teaspoon of fresh cracked pepper and 1/4 of a teaspoon of kosher salt now we want to work fast because we don't want these apples oxidizing so I'm going to go ahead and add my diced apples here in the bowl and I'm going to quickly toss them with this fresh squeezed lemon juice this way it'll keep the apples from turning brown now once we get this tossed in our lemon juice we're going to add the celery and the grapes and I'm telling you this salad is so nice and fresh and full of fabulous flavors I can see why it was definitely a favorite amongst the New Yorkers back in the late 1800s now to this I'm going to add the salt and the pepper now you also may add your salt and pepper into your your Mayo or your you know sour cream or yogurt whatever you're going to use now we're going to add I'm adding mayonnaise this is just pure mayonnaise the light step really is not going to work that well now if you're going to serve this salad right away you want to go ahead and add your toasted walnuts or pecans or almonds whatever you want to add is your nut the classic way of making this salad is using the the walnuts so that's Welling corporated so if you're not going to serve your salad right away you want to wait to add your pecans but I'm going to serve the salad right away so I'm going to add my nuts give it a nice little tossing and now this is ready to serve usually the Waldorf Astoria salad is served on a bed of lettuce which I've served right here and I'm going to go on in get a piece of apple and celery and a little piece of grape and give it a try mmm Wow mmm the combinations of the apples of salaries the gripe with that little touch of salt and pepper and the creaminess from the Mayo absolutely makes this win-win I can see why it was a Big Apple favorite hey y'all hope you give it a try I'm Durrani with visa 101 and I'll catch you next time
