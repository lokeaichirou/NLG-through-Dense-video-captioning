 our next guest Jackie Mike Cody grew up surrounded by authentic flavors of real Italian cooking it was in her grandmother's kitchen where she developed a passion for food and the Italian culture well Jack LaLanne Mike Oni is the author of celebrate Italian style and she's here today Jackie welcome back so nice to see you again we should mention too that your teacher and you've got the day off I do teacher all right Bailey right yeah we're so happy to have you back let's talk about what you're teaching us to make today we're gonna be making penne alla vodka Oh yummy and this is this recipe that's actually in your book it's in my book of course I doctored it up a little bit so this one's a little bit different than the one that's in the book but it's so right around the same okay so there's a secret ingredient you're not going to be giving away so what are the ingredients where should we begin your recipe okay right now we have about a half a stick of butter that's already melted okay we're going to add about a quarter cup of extra-virgin olive oil perfect you're then going to throw in that is true.you and pancetta prosciutto stood out two slices all cut up and pancetta is Italian bacon okay so we're gonna throw that right in and we're going to let it start to brown up turn it up a little bit and this is something I'm sure anybody can kind of make yeah it's really easy it's really easy it has you know a couple ingredients but you know what it you let it simmer and it's good to go sounds good garlic Aloka and how much do you recommend I have two cloves of garlic do you close it garlic you have anything with garlic okay yes beautiful okay that's there and you're gonna wear this kind of simmer a little bit okay and you've got some other spices walk us through these other spices I'm just curious what we have here we have sun-dried tomatoes I like the kind that's in oil just because they're a little bit easier to work with and a little bit easier to cut you can get the ones that are already just dried out those ones you'll find any like the vegetable aisle right but these ones would be with your marinated vegetables like marinated mushrooms and that kind of stuff perfect I'm so I have five of those you can throw those right on in detail about I don't know that I think I've said right tomatoes oh I like that interesting twist whatever my little twist okay and then you're gonna throw and that's a half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper okay throw that in there yeah it's a spice okay and I have about two tablespoons of fresh parsley and if you want to use dried you just use one tablespoon okay perfect so that in there throw it right in okay perfect and then we have one can of crushed tomatoes that were throwing all right here we go one can question me do I got it now yup dump it right in and are we cooking this a medium heat kind of like yep right between low and medium and you want to keep it out of simmer okay and what you're gonna do is we're not going to spill it okay you're gonna let this simmer for about fifteen to twenty minutes okay so we're gonna put that aside so we're actually fast-forwarding as we are fast-forward it's on the Connecticut style so she knows we had a fast forty are so weird like that 20 minutes yep okay and we have our next step okay which is we already have something that's been simmering for a little bit yep and we are gonna get our creams in our vodka okay creams in our vodka oh wow she's roof okay and we need our half a cup there half a cup there okay we're gonna use 1/2 a cup of everything okay perfect first so would it be pouring in wait about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream okay half a cup of heavy cream uh-huh okay and this one is light clean yep okay half a cup of light cream all right it in okay and then we have our half a cup of vodka oh that's all okay here we go and we're gonna jump that in there yeah it just gives it an extra flavor I mean this is it this dish isn't like a your classic Italian dish it's not like one that came from centuries ago it's a relatively new one to be honest my grandmother never made it it wasn't something that she made but it's one of the newer in terms of Italian cooking but it's whoever figured it out it's pretty good so now we're gonna let that sit for about 20 minutes cuz you want the alcohol to cook off you don't want to be taking bite full of vodka right um so you want to let it simmer down and cook off so while we let that cook we're gonna now make some chicken cutlets okay perfect first thing we're gonna do we're gonna turn up the heat a little bit to get our oil going you could add a little bit more oil to that that'll be maybe about a quarter cup okay now I doctor up my breadcrumbs what I was about a cup and a half of seasoned breadcrumbs okay I add a half a cup of Parmesan cheese okay good kind of fun I have about 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning beautiful and what else waters fat your pepper which red to this side okay here we go and toss that a little bit of salt and pepper okay I'm sure it's kind of to taste I mean you can absolutely yeah okay chicken cutlets we're just gonna toss in there we are gonna dip them in eggs first because we want the breadcrumbs to stick in this recipe we're making it would be how many um this one would definitely feed six to eight people oh okay they have small appetite yeah alright so now we've already dipped it in here at both sides both sides okay and you're gonna put it in there we're gonna cook it right here is any games we're against the clock the idea is we want to definitely make sure that it's brown and cooked my wives around it takes about three minutes on each side you want thin cutlets I Chih I buy the ones that are already nice and trimmed because I absolutely despise having to cut off all the fat on the chicken so okay I get the ones that are already all nice and done for me or that way and they're nice and thin so they're much easier to cook with so why don't we do this can you plate up the one you've got some orange dipping this oil we at least have this because we got a full house in here we've got people waiting to buy this and we've got hair stylist here and everybody wants to answer I would let you plate that up we're gonna get a shot of that in just a second however folks at home if you want to try this recipe Jackie my Coney
