 what you want what you want you want hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens what you want Wednesday today we're taking a request from s strawberry and they sent me a request for Caesar salad I'm actually making this follow mums birthday so let's get started first thing you want to do is start on your Caesar salad dressing and the first thing I want to put into the bowl is two egg yolks no whites just the yolks okay so separate your eggs and just keep the yolks next I want to put in some fresh minced garlic just straight in to the egg yolks next I want to put in some Dijon mustard this gives this caesar salad a really nice kick right at the end and of course I'm going to put in some anchovies now I'm using n chili paste if you want to use real anchovies that's fine I just find I get a better flavor from the paste and of course I'm going to add in some red wine vinegar and this just helps balance the whole dressing it gives it a real nice tartness now this is very important make sure you mix this part well okay because what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding olive oil to this dressing now if you don't do this right the dressing is going to split okay so what you want to do whisking all the time very quickly don't stop in an s-shape I want you to slowly add the olive oil until there is none left do not stop whisking once the oil has run out season it well with salt and pepper and it should be nice and creamy just like this if you've emulsified that olive oil and the egg properly like you see here it'll be this beautiful thick pale white creamy sauce just like you see on the screen if it splits there you can't save it you'll have to start again now that our Caesar dressing is finished put it aside and we're going to start on our croutons now get a nice crusty bread something like a sourdough or something like that nice and crusty and nice and soft on the inside you going to be toasting these in the oven so just cut them up into fairly good-sized pieces you don't want them too small arrange them on a baking tray lined with baking paper I'm going to dress them with some olive oil now you want to put these into the oven only for about 15 minutes at about 180 degree C until they're nice and golden brown the next thing I want to do is fry off our bacon until it's nice and crispy so into a hot pan no oil because we've already got that fat on the bacon and that will reduce down cook this until it's nice and crispy now over a colander I'm just washing our cause lettuce leaves now you can use other lettuce if you wanted to like an iceberg or something like that but cause lettuce is traditionally served with a Caesar salad so that's what I'm using here today so just wash it well make sure all the sands out after my Bacon's fried I'm just draining the excess oil with some paper towel I'm cutting that bacon into about the same pieces as the croutons not too small but not too large either now it's time to plate up the first thing you want to do is arrange that cause lettuce beautifully on the bottom there just like that because we're going to be putting all those ingredients almost like a shell into that lettuce adding the croutons now look at them they are beautiful and golden brown lovely and toasted nice soft centers that's what you're after with your croutons I'm adding the bacon and that's a salty bacon just goes so well with it and of course we're going to add over our dressing that we've made and have a look at that it is absolutely beautiful but it's not finished yet we're going to of course finish this off with some freshly shaved parmesan cheese and have a look at that absolutely beautiful the perfect accompaniment to any lunch absolutely beautiful now my mum is actually trying this as we speak that surfing is there don't think mine are more gone wrinkly like hers joking anyway guys if you want to make this all the ingredients are below make sure you give this a try it's absolutely fantastic it's dead easy you'll never ever go to another cafe again to make it because you'll do it at home I'll see you this Friday for fast food Friday you take care and I'll see you then
