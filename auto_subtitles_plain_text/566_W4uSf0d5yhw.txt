 hello it's didi again welcome to Dedes Mediterranean kitchen today I'm going to teach you how to make a great dish it's a side dish it's a dip they can put it on pita bread you can do whatever you want with it it's called hummus this is a form of a chickpea spread with some great sesame seed paste some garlic some lemon juice it's just great now you can serve this on pita bread you can put it on chicken you can dip it with vegetables I've seen this in all kinds of different forms what you want to do is start off with a can of garbanzo beans or chickpeas now I different you know different stores different labels call it different things but you want to look for garbanzo beans or chickpeas you want to do is give them a quick rinse what I'm going to do is just turn off the water so they were packed in quick rinse in some water not a big deal very easy to do see our mince them you want to add this to a food processor now some people use blenders some people use food products to stores whatever is then I'll mush it up um add this to the food processor next ingredient you're going to add is tahini it's felt tah I and I this is a sesame seed paste you don't want to give it a little bit of a mix just because the oil from the sesame seeds goes to the top so give it a nice little mix I'm not a big measuring person but you want to add about fourth cup to a half cup depending on your taste of the tahini mixture you can just add it directly to or you can measure it next thing great you want to add which keeps the the homos really moist and from chunking up is some yogurt or sour cream you want about you want to add about 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup depending on texture we're gonna start by heading about 1/4 cup of it and then depending on the consistency we can add more you want to add about 3 or 4 just leaves of mint fresh mint gives it a really nice flavor you really don't see it in the mixture it's just a little hidden flavor that's in there you just add those directly to the food processor another thing you want to add is a juice of one lemon again lemon is a great thing it gives it a little bit of a zest and then the most important ingredient is garlic now what I did is I have two cloves of garlic you want to add some salt to the garlic because when you have it in the mortar it helps mash them up a lot about you want to add about half a teaspoon of the mint of the salt mash it up just like that just add it now you want to have you're going to want to give the mixture let it mix for I'd say about two minutes before stirring it or combining it when it's being processed the Tajin egg makes it a little bit thicker so again depending on the consistency you can add a little bit of water to it a couple tablespoons I'm going to finish processing this and then decide on that all right just remove the top and with a spatula don't use any metal spoons or anything plastic spatula you can check the consistency of it let me show you see right there it's a little bit thick I think I'm going to add maybe two tablespoons of cold water just helps the texture again you still have that fourth cup of yogurt left over so we're going to give this a taste and see what else it needs needs a little bit more lemon what you can do you can see that your consistency is right you don't want to make it more watery you can add some citric acid citric acid is I guess a form of lemon that's concentrated you can add but I have a teaspoon of this you don't want to add too much because then it'll be too lemony just going to add a half teaspoon of this to the processor the salt was fine when I tasted it give it one more taste and see how it is now amazing perfect again depending on what you like you can add some more salt giving you a less garlic you can add more garlic we have more lemon juice it's all depends on what you like those are the main ingredients that I gave you I'm going to show you a real nice way serve it with a spatula yep I get most of it depending on the size or a plate maybe not all of it you can serve it in a dip bowl you can serve out a plate like this make it all fancy any way you like you want to spread it out I'll spread it out in the dish just like this finding on the sides of the dish that you use why not leave a little bit of it in the middle and I'll show you what we can do with that after you spread it out in the plate you want to chop off but two tablespoons of some parsley what I do is I put this in the center of it or you can put it along the side depending on what you want to do you can get some olives decorated with some olives some radishes whatever you want again depending on your preference you can use either cayenne pepper or paprika I accused pepper II got this autumn take away from the flavor of the the actual dip this put it along the sides gives a great color and really doesn't take away from the taste of it then a final thing is the olive oil again you're going to want to use extra virgin olive oil just put it up around it keeps the dip moist and it's a nice flavor to it just like that and that's it now imagine serving this to your friends how great does that look enjoy it and tune in
