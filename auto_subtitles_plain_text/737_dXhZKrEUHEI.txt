 now this is one of my favorite on trace now it is a little bit more of a restaurant dish but you can adapt it and do it quite easily at home now the first thing we're going to do we're going to make an avocado mousse with a little bit of wasabi nice ripe avocado she's going to cut it in half be very careful doing this just twist it take the seed out little chop into it pull it out peel the avocado avocado into a little mixer got a little bit of wasabi powder here we can use fresh wasabi the powder is a little bit stronger what we've got here is a little bit of sugar syrup juice it will give it that beautiful sweetness and it'll balance with that heat of the wasabi and just puree right once you've actually pureed it just taste it now you get that real sweetness of the sugar syrup to being taste wasabi but with the sugar content you actually want to add a little bit of acidity to it just to combat it so the best thing is a nice fresh light just put a little bit of lime just into it absolutely perfect we'll just let that sit there the next step is a beautiful dressing it's a daikon dressing it's very typical of a Japanese dressing it's got beautiful balance now the first thing we're going to do is to add all our liquids a little bit of soy it's actually a light so you don't want it too rich just into a bowl a little bit of mirin marin's got a little bit of sweetness to it so it's a great balance also now the vinegar rice wine vinegar always really important use rice wine vinegar it's typical in Japanese cooking so we just add that to the base and we're going to be really careful and add just a little bit of sesame or sesame is really really strong so you don't want to add too much so just a couple drops now to give the dressing a little bit of body we've got a little bit of ginger rather than and chopped up really far we've got a nice marker paint here just get a great a little bit of ginger into it if we're gonna add some daikon which is basically a Chinese radish same thing again with a microplane what's really important now with this dressing is to actually let it infuse so just let it sit as long as you possibly can until you leave it right the next thing to do is the salad it a little bit of daikon very carefully nice thin slivers a really important thing to do is when you're chopping or you're julienning is to make sure you keep those fingers out of the way so I'm going to rest the knife up against my knuckles and I'm just going to slowly chop and if you keep your fingers nice and cold you don't have your fingernails out and you won't chop them off right there we have some nice little battens now without cucumber we're going to do two things with it we're gonna do little strips or ribbons and we're going to wrap it around so we can put our ocean trap row on top of it and the other ones we're going to actually Julie in it so just peel to get our strips we're just going to use a peeler we're gonna try and dig into a little bit harder and what we normally would we're just gonna peel it what you've got is a long strip like that and if we just wrap it around like so it's like a little casing now for our julienne about the same size of the daikon julienne strips put that into your bowl you can see that now you've got a nice little salad of daikon a cucumber we're going to add a little mushrooms and nokey mushrooms and just fold it through that's really really important to have good quality chili you want that beautiful bright red color you want it to be in nice little cubes like little bite-size pieces so we're just gonna be really careful here and just cut straight down with a nice chunk I'm just gonna even that up so some nice little cubes you can see the nice little bite-size pieces now to put this dish together we've got our beautiful little salad just gonna put a little bit of baby coriander and it also now you want to put the baby coriander right at the end you don't want to put it in when you actually make it yourself in the beginning because you want a little nice and profession you don't want it to go too limp at all so it's gonna sprinkle it over nice a little bit of salad on the plate now we're gonna grab our tuna and very carefully it's gonna place it on top now without cucumber we're just gonna place it on top we've got our little avocado wasabi mousse we're gonna pour that into the top you really want to just try and keep that shape now we've got some beautiful salmon pearls I'm just gonna pour that on top beauty go overboard and really heap it on now we're just gonna dress our tuna you can see it a little bit too daikon up and that's what you might want that texture just pull that all over the top believe it or not fresh wasabi is in season we're just gonna put the smallest amount just grate it over the top that's just gonna add to the dish and there you have it guys our beautiful sashimi of tuna with a daikon and cucumber salad you
