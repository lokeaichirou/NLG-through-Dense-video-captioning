 but now I'm going to teach you how to make a shotgun biryani here is one glass of basmati rice that you have painstakingly washed and the water is like one and a half times in a rice cooker if you're going to do the padilha it will be double but here is just one and a half times these are mixed vegetables I put in one third cup water and I'm going to microwave them i'll do it for five minutes i'm going to add a little bit of salt not too much will you add a little bit of sugar to maintain the color of the vegetables this is going in 45 minutes cool in the rice I am going to add a little bit of tarqah water whenever there's water you have to make it dry up otherwise the oil and there we discussed fluttering a little bit of oil mr. water totally dry while this is time let's just go and add some salt to this canal teaspoon of salt and this is fake biryani so I'm just teaching you to put you can take Shawn or any other belonging so you will have a different flavor every time brioni powder how about 22 teaspoons and there it's all going in we don't follow any strict measurements when we are really when we think we are real pros okay Pratt will buy oil now no one will come from circa all right what's the third seasoning I'm just going to likely as less as possible to fry this stuff and the stuff that durka is going to consist of cheetah wats jeera cumin seeds you have to wait for all you there a little bit hot I'm not too hot because you know one black dude I just want out round Snyder's flattered very truly I am putting peppercorns because you like them and you know they're good for your health my parents you like you know they're good for your hold and all that stuff so that's all we need as far as seasonings for assault and biryani founder and that's it fasala boxing that's you've happening yep how long it'll take start giving it another two seconds you can hear it getting all excited dick and it can sometimes flutter in your face so you want to be exit and I'm just going to call this in here that is it we're gonna cover it when it is almost done when you hear the the cook button turn off and become keep at that stage you just take those vegetables and put them in here all right and that's it and let it sit for another 10 sec 10 minutes so that all the flavors that melded and that is your fake vegetable biryani and if you want it to be a little more room me if you like onions shortcut just put fried onions cool I know if it's don't like them so long so we will go down see I've it a rest when that happens we will just dump it in there when this goes to keep and that ruins done just put it in there then mix everything and that will be over Yanni
