 today we are going to prepare shepherd's pie and to towards ahead of time and I used as potato peeler which is really easy to remove the peel and I cubed potatoes I'm bothered for about 25 minutes and then with in the water and with himself those are ready to go you got a feeling fearful source of frozen potatoes which you can use respond directions they're a quick method if you want to use them now to a 10 and a half spoon of oil and I've chopped up the onions into small pieces as you can see and added a pound of one which is now cooking in the oil we're going to keep cooking this until it's nice and brown similar to Amber galit that's how we want it completely cooked through don't see any redness or bloody meat which I see it now some bread that's what I mean by that is going to keep cooking for a while well that's cooked rabbi some water here we need two thirds of a cup of water and we've added an ox or cube which is one of these which I've just crumbled into the container here and i'll be adding to two-thirds of a lot this will be the brown stock that we need to add to the meat when it's cooked you just crumble this is comforting we come when the walter rather just let this cook a little longer would be as for a while right enough of flowers help to soak up some of the juices and I'll get to think you can see now the redness of the meats is gone I can see it's all brand I'm going to have the flower just plain flour all purpose flour as we call it in America and that won't help to thicken up the juices and make it all together nice one types of some of the juices then let's get thicker when we add the stock blend in and now I need to add the water to the axle the barrel stock I'm just adding it up to the three two thirds of a cup measure which is about four ounces and I'm going to add this to the meat and let it simmer for two or three minutes try getting regular out of them are back with us and let's stop so simple two or three minutes pick it up yeah things up a couple of minutes just simmer for about two or three minutes now I'd like to have some salt and pepper just to season it not too much salt because I like to be light on the song jokes are just dash that and then just stir that and i'm going to add it to an eye by nine inch glass dish hey to Beadie because it needs to be able to handle all the meat and the juices which was we actually get thicker and thicker as it cooks scrape up all of us to pull the bottom of the pan it's going to be slice along as why does have to be a ground one let us know yep your cat's fine details of the butcher if you will prepare you some ground lamb off nice long always available for you to pick up but if you ask the butcher a little bit quite a blinding when I make shepherd's pie I like to add some vegetables to it cuz I mean when my son was young we didn't didn't always like vegetables so this is another way for people to get vegetables into recipes and all my aunt likes to ride it forces one doesn't really like vegetables so she adds it to and just press it in and during the cast is a of it being cooked it will cook vegetables in the oven now we are ready for the potatoes are already being taught to crack the 25 minutes and I'm going to Ashton I'm going to add some milk just a little bit let me have a cup then I'm going to add salt and pepper to taste mr. top you get a bit more flavor if you really want to go one step further you can also add some cheese just another daughter just about 1 tablespoon of butter and then mash it until it comes to a creamy consistency nice and puffy after you've mash the potatoes just put it on top of the meat mixture and the vegetable mixture I'm just gonna make out coopering Gover it from edge to edge like I said you cannot choose to this if you like to make it up different again and some people even use instead of potatoes turnips which a little bit more difficult to handle then your priority is named to vigorous bag so traditional shepherd's around has potato now you have the potatoes on top of the meat just press it down press it down nicely and then make a design on top to make it even look more appealing okay now using the mail make like tram lines across the top just to make it look attractive you have to get too crazy with this very simple now we have our prepared dish of shepherd's pie and is ready to go in the oven which is set at 350 degrees and gas mark 4 if you add for that setting and let's just open the oven and put it in the middle of the oven where it will cook for 45 minutes okay the shepherd's pie night is now fully cooked as you can see it's nice and bubbly nice and crispy on the top the potatoes are one you need really a few minutes for this cool down I did put a tray underneath to stop it from dirty in the oven the duties Duke tend to rip down when it's cool depending on many people around I general to cut it down the middle okay we've taken the shepherd's pie out of the oven it's been cooking for 45 minutes we've let it settle just for a few minutes so we can scoop it out of the pan and it comes out nice and easy with a spatula place it on the plot and I've also bought ready-made grier because that's not one of my specialties but savory beef gravy works wonderfully with up just as warm it up and then add some to the shepherd's pie and I've also cooked them some broccoli to go with it and there you have enough English meal
