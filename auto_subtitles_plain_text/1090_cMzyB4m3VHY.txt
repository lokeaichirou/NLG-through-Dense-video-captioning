 today I will make one of the most popular pizzas that you can possibly order anywhere in the world a pepperoni pizza I've made my own pizza dough from scratch but if you want to know how to make it check out my recipe on the channel I'm rolling this dough out into a 12-inch pizza base after rolling out the pizza do initially I've just stretched it to fit a 12 by 12 inch piece of parchment paper and I'm just going to lift it up and place it on the baking tray when it has to go into the oven so any self-respecting pepperoni pizza has to have a really kick-ass tomato based sauce so I'm going to show you how to make a really nice rich luscious tomato based sauce for this pizza I've curated some Tomatoes roughly about 300 grams salt to taste a dash of chili flakes and oregano finely chopped garlic cloves the sauce is reduced by half and is now completely cooked so it's time to just take it off the heat and now for the exciting part of assembling this pizza just slather on that source and just spread it out the sauce smells so good I could just eat it all on its own and just lots of madela don't skimp on it be generous with it and just top it up with pepperoni doesn't that look really good I'm gonna bake this now at my ovens highest temperature which is about 250 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes just look at that I think this pizza just speaks for itself I'm just gonna slice it up now because I just don't want to talk anymore I want to eat this pizza so guys like comment subscribe you know the drill
