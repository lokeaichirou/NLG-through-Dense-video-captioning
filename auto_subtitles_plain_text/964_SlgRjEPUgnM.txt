 [Music] hi there I'm chef Eric Crowley owner of the culinary classroom in West Los Angeles and today I'm going to show you how to make Eggs Benedict for our Eggs Benedict we're going to need hollandaise sauce video of which you can find elsewhere on Mahalo com we're also going to need a little bit of ham or some kind of pork product here I'd like some prosciutto we warm it basically in a little skillet for a minute or two or you can warm it in a microwave oven we are going to need some toasted English muffins or any other kind of bread we'll wind up doing really well English muffins are classic and by the way for this damn Canadian bacon is the classic type of ham to go on there but any kind of ham will do just fine we also have some poached eggs you can see that video elsewhere on mahalo calm as well these eggs have been poached they've been shocked in ice water and they've been drained we need to rewarm these and we wind up taking our room-temperature eggs and slide them into some warm water and can be used that you could use the same water that you use to make your hollandaise sauce with and basically put it into a little bit of warm water let them sit in there for about 30 maybe 45 seconds that's all we're looking for we don't want to cook the eggs anymore we just want to take the chill off and warm them up slightly come out of the water get them onto some paper towels you want to dry off the egg or else when you want to put in the hollandaise sauce on top it's going to dilute the sauce and it's going to make it run all over so some paper toweling blot it dry then we're going to lift the egg out whoops get your warmed up bacon or in this case some prosciutto on your English muffin get your egg on top of there and then we're gonna finish it off with our hollandaise sauce right over the top let it pour all over you can even get it down on to the plate and that is how you make a classic dish Eggs Benedict thanks again for watching be sure to subscribe so you can get some additional information if there's a recipe that you would like to see me make feel free to send an email to requests at Mahalo com thanks again and I'll see you soon [Music]
