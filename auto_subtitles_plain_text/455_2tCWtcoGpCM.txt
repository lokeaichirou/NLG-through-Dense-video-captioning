 hi guys today I'm making shrimp and lobster Tambora if you want to join with me let's begin I like to use your mousse trim remove the shell but leave the tail on here's another tip of removing the vein of the shrimp there's a vein on the bottom of the shrimp when you cook it it tends to curls up for this I like to keep my stream straight so I give it a few shallow cuts to marinate the shrimp I'm using half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of sugar one teaspoon of garlic powder and half a teaspoon of ground pepper mix well and let it sit for 15 minutes you can also use lobster tails but it's your challenge to remove the meat from the shell do small shallow cuts on the bottom and marinate with salt sugar garlic powder and ground pepper these are for fried vegetables I have a sweet potato zucchini eggplant onion and potato I'm using Tambora seafood batter mix it's very easy just follow the instruction on the back of the package let me show you how to fire the shrimp pull the shrimp by the tail dip in the batter fry the shrimp until its turn to golden when this room is ready put the shrimp on paper towels to absorb excess oil repeat the same steps with the lobster tails it's almost done put the vegetables in the batter a piece by piece fry into a turn to golden I'm serving mushroom and lobster tomorrow with pickled ginger Saburo dipping sauce and wasabi to make this little flower I use pickle ginger and wasabi to make this plate more appetizing it's time to serve I need to make my sauce ready be careful with the wasabi it's very hot so don't put too much in the sauce yummy this is a perfect finger food for me Wow look at this big lobster tail mmm so delicious thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe bye bye
