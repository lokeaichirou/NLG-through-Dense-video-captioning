 so we just came back from Firefly and we're back at rosso and we're gonna go ahead and make a traditional Italian pasta recipe called penne alla vodka and since we were just at Firefly I figured we'd use Firefly vodka market friends this is a really simple recipe with very few ingredients we've got plum tomatoes I use a little bit of tomato paste to kind of pump up the tomato flavor garlic salt pepper vodka of course cream butter and penne pasta so the first thing we're gonna do since I'm using whole San Marzano tomatoes is we're gonna puree them a little bit so we have our sauce now you can use tomato puree if you want straight from the store that works just fine this is what I have at the restaurant and I like to use these I think they're pretty flavorful so we're gonna just slowly blend this a little bit now if you do this also at home I want to make sure of one thing do not over blend it because whatever it'll do is it'll pump air into it and turn it into this pink mess it'll taste the same but it won't taste the same you kind of lose the the the intensity of the tomatoes once it kind of aerates it so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna add a little bit Abell spoon or so of tomato paste that kind of adds that concentrated flavor because what we're gonna end up doing is watering down the tomato flavor a little bit with the vodka and the cream I like my vodka sauce with a lot of garlic in it also but I don't like bits of garlic this is kind of a bit of an elegant sauce so all I do is I basically take about eight to ten cloves of garlic give em a good whack breaks them open put them in the pan and we're going to go over set them on the range get them sauteing a little bit all right we've got our garlic in the pan we're need some extra virgin olive oil and you can use extra virgin olive oil I don't care what people have told you about not being able to cook with it it works just fine for cooking we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna let this garlic Brown a little bit and release all this flavor all right garlic is browning really nicely now we're gonna add the tomato now be very careful when you do this you want to get your Tomatoes close to it cuz it will spatter up all right so this all this brown garlic is gonna infuse this tomato puree with its flavor but it's still just tomato puree so make sure you season we're gonna season with salt I always used kosher salt because it's got a good feel to it it's flaky you can pinch a lot of it and control how much you're putting in all right now we're gonna add some black pepper we're gonna put in some red pepper flakes now I like my vodka sauce a little bit on the spicy side so we're gonna add a little extra since it's mine we've got our penne pasta cooking over here in some nice salty water always remember that your salt I mean your water should be as salty as the Mediterranean all right now we're gonna add the vodka and we're gonna let this simmer and let all those flavors from the garlic salt and pepper get in there if you tasted it now you'd kind of have a vodka definitely a Bloody Mary vodka kick to it but we're gonna let all the vodkas simmer out of this all the alcohol so now it's reduced quite a bit it's getting thicker so we're gonna go ahead and put it in our cream all right you know mix it in right now probably have about two and a half cups or so of sauce and I just put in about 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream our pasta is almost done now as I told you earlier we don't want to keep the garlic chunks in there so what I'm gonna do is using my slotted spoon I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna remove my garlic now we may miss a piece or two but that's not a big deal it is garlic after all and when we love garlic our pasta done we're going to go ahead and add that to the sauce and drain it well we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna allow this pasta to cook in the sauce for a little while so it absorbs some of the sauce now I've took the pasta out when it was al dente so it's still got some bite to it probably a little more bite than you would normally serve right off the bat but it's gonna cook a little bit longer all right now we're gonna put some cheese in there because it wouldn't be pasta without cheese we've got some pecorino romano you could use parmigiano-reggiano we'll keep a little bit on the side for when we put it on the table so we're to go ahead and mix that in that'll thicken the sauce a little bit more adds that depth of flavor that you can only get with a hard dried cheese I think we're ready to go here to written it up a little bit we're going to go ahead we're going to mix in a little bit of unsalted butter all right here we go penne alla vodka we can just put all of it in here using Firefly vodka from Wadmalaw Island we'll finish it with a little bit more cheese a little pecorino romano a little bit of fresh parsley gremolata and there you go penne alla vodka straight to the table thanks for watching off menu
