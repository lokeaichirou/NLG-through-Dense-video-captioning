 hello everyone welcome to Dedes Mediterranean kitchen today we're going to be making falafel those wonderful fried patties made of chick peas and fava beans they make a great vegetarian sandwich and today I'm going to show you how to make it the first ingredients we're going to use our dry chickpeas and dried fava beans we're going to soak them overnight in water to the brim and then the next morning we're going to pour off the water when we assemble the falafel next we have cilantro and parsley you're going to need about a cup to a cup and a half of cilantro fresh cilantro as always and about a half cup of fresh parsley you're also going to need one large onion you can use yellow onion or white onion either one we're also going to need about 8 cloves of garlic about 2 tablespoons of ground coriander a tablespoon of ground cumin half teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper half cup of bread crumbs two to three tablespoons of flour some salt a teaspoon of baking soda and a half teaspoon of baking powder you want to start by first blending the chickpeas in a good food processor you don't want to use canned chickpeas or canned fava beans because they have too much moisture and too many preservatives it's best to just use the soaking process overnight we're going to blend these until they're a fine crumbly mixture now after you're done grinding them up you want to put empty them into a bowl we're gonna do the same things with the fava beans and then blend them until they're nice and crumbly we're also going to input these into the same Bowl after we do this step we're going to add the cilantro the parsley and the onion to the blender and process that until it's a nice paste about halfway through we're gonna add one of the most important ingredients garlic I know you all love garlic and then just continue to blend after we're done blending we're gonna add to the other ingredients you should smell this it smells amazing this cilantro and parsley garlic onion what better is there than that at this point we want to mix it until it's very well combined falafel was actually traditionally made with just fava beans as it moved north along the Mediterranean people started to incorporate chickpeas into it some people make it with just chickpeas some people make it with just fava beans there's a lot of little variations to the dish but the main ingredients are the chickpeas and the fava beans falafel is also a very healthy dish if you don't fry it you can also bake it but many people just fry it up it has a lot of protein and a lot of fiber after we've combined the ingredients we're going to add all the seasoning start with the coriander the cumin the cane pepper you don't like it spicy you don't have to add the cayenne pepper when you add the breadcrumbs and salt we're gonna add two teaspoons salt actually let's do three some people like it really salty some people don't like it they're salty it all depends on how you like it and then we're going to mix this up really well after we add all the seasoning we want to check the dough's consistency this is a lot like a dough and if you see that it's too crumbly what you can do as a fix-it is to add some flour I like to add two to three tablespoons of flour you don't want to add too much because you don't want it to be too doughy and then it'll stay raw in the middle when you fry it so just mix it up again after you add the flour and you're done mixing it you can actually freeze it falafel can actually freeze for up to a month but you want to freeze it before you add the baking soda or the baking powder so just like that we're going to add our baking soda and our baking powder and then we're going to let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes so that those ingredients activate all together and you get a nice fluffy falafel so the baking powder and the baking soda and just mix it all up while the falafel is sitting and you're waiting for it you want to pre-heat a two to three inch deep frying pan just a regular frying pan and you want to add to it about it inch and a half of just regular vegetable oil I know it's not that healthy but falafel is a great indulgence and makes a great sandwich falafel mixture has been sitting for 15 minutes now it's time to fry the falafel there's two different ways you can mold the falafel when you fry them you can use a falafel Boulder or you can use two spoons now I know this is not readily available everywhere so you can just use two spoons I'll show you both ways so we're just going to get a spoonful of this and you just want to mold it up so it's a nice little fall just like that and be careful when you're frying it you don't want to burn yourself have the oil on medium heat and just slowly drop it in and continue until you have about ten of them in the frying pan now you want to let them cook until they're about medium golden brown you don't want some too dark and you want to make sure that the oil is on medium low heat because otherwise they'll be nice and dark on the outside but they'll be raw on the inside so you definitely don't want that you want to turn them over just to make sure that they're not sticking look at that color see how nice that color is right in there for just a few more seconds see the falafel they smell amazing what am i lay them on a paper towel so that it absorbs all the excess oil now you want to fry the falafel right before you serve them if you fry them too far in advance they end up getting really doughy and they end up getting really soft falafel is known to be fluffy that's what the word means so you want to make sure they're crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside now if you're going to use a falafel mold what you're going to do is you want to pull it down and then just fill it with a falafel mixture just you can use a spatula just like that and then you want to drop it in to the oil it needs a little help to keep your hand low so you don't splash now we're done frying up our falafel I'm going to put our great sandwich together snap you're trying to stay away from the carbs that's okay you don't have to put it into a sandwich you can just eat it with this great tahini sauce it's really easy to make it's just some teeny olive oil water garlic mix it all up and it makes a great sauce or you can serve it with garlic sauce I know you all love that garlic so what I do is I have a knife locust ketta and I'm going to put some of the tahini sauce just like that you can add any vegetables you want to the sandwich I like to add a lot of tomatoes to my sandwich I also like to add Kebede which are these wonderful pickled turnips and then some lettuce and I'm gonna add a little bit of the garlic sauce just because you can never get enough garlic I like to add a lot of garlic sauce you don't like garlic you don't have to well who doesn't like garlic it's amazing next you want to get your falafel patty and place it in the sandwich now traditionally they actually mush the falafel patty when they add it so that's what we're gonna do is just break it up just like that but I want to show you what it looks like look at that look at how nice and green the falafel is it's nice and fluffy and you can see that the inside is not raw or doughy anymore it's perfect put that down we're gonna roll up our sandwich just like they do with the falafel sand roll it nice and tight and I like to use aluminum foil to wrap the sandwich to make it look like just the way you buy it when you're at the restaurant if the sandwich made for a king thank you for joining me on
