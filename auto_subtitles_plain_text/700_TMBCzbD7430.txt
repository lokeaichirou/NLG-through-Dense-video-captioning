 you know what I noticed the other day there are no young people on all of these clicking shows you know what you're right did I know colored people no for real that's weird it is weird you know what we should do right what there should be a show with two young people that are black yeah they're stylish and they cook with great ingredients and there's drinking and they're funny and there's whiskey we should really do this what a little pervy it's a great idea [Music] you wanna grab a drink instead yes because we're sick of your struggle playground [Music] everybody welcome and thank you so much for joining us on the very first episode of butter and brown we are so excited so the first thing we're gonna do just like you'll see on every episode of butter and brown the follow is we're gonna start off with the cocktail you know it and it will always be comprised of a brown liquor because we love it so much and really because I'm tired to seeing everybody order that crap at the bar like cranberry and vodka la waters Long Island iced teas Irish Car Bomb College is over it's done medica okay so we're going to teach you today how to make a classic drink so you can do it at home and it has a classic name as well oh here's what you need a little bit of sugar some Angostura bitters regular and orange suburban we're gonna use four roses it's probably the best you can get under 20 bucks or thermal couple glasses and an orange while I get started step is gonna grab some ice you need about a teaspoon of sugar per glass remember this is according to your level of sweetness we like to taste the liquor so we don't put that much 8 to 10 nations of the Angostura bitters the regular 1 2 to 3 of the orange for love flavor [Music] and two ounces of bourbon per glass now you can have a four if you want to but keep it classy now we're gonna drop these two big beautiful two fancy ice cubes in the glasses well we prefer to use the bigger than ice cubes because they melt a lot slower than the ice chips do them so now the last thing we want to do is we want to take that everyday orange that we talked about we want to cut two pieces of the rind off and there's one for Leslie thank you and then there's one for me oh that's not big enough let me cut another one yeah one for me we want to hold that Rhine over the glass itself we want to extract the oils and press on it you see that almost burnt off my beard I want to rub that around the rim of the glass and the last thing we want to do is just drop that in a drink for a little garnish and enjoy telogen Easter would you end up gently go school which church you better know but of course you know there was a dinner and then what did they have that dry spaghetti in that big pan with the minors why would a its regretted that that's all a lot of people notice the holy pasta dish they thought amazing but there's so many others are flattening shrimp scampi who can't make or penne alla vodka would it look chicken CZ good you trying to make me eat I'm getting this kitchen let's see so we're gonna make penne alla vodka me and it's really easy all this stuff is things you probably have in your cabinet right definitely there is penne pasta we got a little olive oil we're gonna have some aromatics shallots garlic to lit the business a little you know then we have a little tomatoes and of course the cheese now because we're too young black people let's acknowledge this chicken [ __ ] right now [Music] I I'll be honest it's been a love-hate relationship nice juicy sometimes I've been been embarrassed of you in public you know Bres it's it's been a back and forth thing up and down sometimes I love it sometimes I don't delicious I mean but in the end it's it's been there for me when nothing else was I love chicken the so does everybody else know one other race of people one of the walk it doesn't love chicken I'll wait but I'm gonna hold you down exactly there isn't one chicken is amazing take off for something right now you've been there for me when no one else was it's me and you to the end chicken [ __ ] even a fried Izzie now that we got that on the way we can go ahead and get started with making the sauce so I'll do that and since is gonna show you how to marinate this chain this is very simple all we want to do is marinate both sides of this chicken with a little olive oil seasoned liberally on both sides with a little kosher salt and finish it off with some pepper and all that's left to do is put that off to the side that easy perfect timing now that I'm done you can go ahead and get started on the sauce so now that we've been is prepping everything we can go ahead and get started as a song that's gonna go ahead and work that out and I'm gonna tell you how it's done the first thing you want to do is pour a little evo in the pot and saut√© up those aromatics that shallots pearbook the garlic and those herbs remember we talked about building flavors from the beginning you don't want things to be nasty after that you're gonna scoop some of those Tomatoes throw those into the pan along with the whole cans of the tomato sauce we're gonna go ahead and bring that to a boil season it up with a little salt and pepper and then we let that come because we want those tomatoes to break down just sounds lovely after we do that we usually want to let those Tomatoes break down some because you don't want to then we're gonna pour in the vodka and the half a cup of cream bring it back to a boil so that's a vodka can embroil itself out and then we have our sauce at that point we want to turn it down to a simmer and let that go ahead and make away while I get started with this chick now by the time we get to the chicken you want to make sure that the pan is screamin hot the reason for this is we want to teach you guys how to make the most moist juicy chicken possible we already know that Leslie doesn't like the word moist what's wrong with it it sounds like we're not talking about dirty panties we're talking about moist chicken and after you guys try this technique at home you'll see exactly why I describe it as such now Leslie's gonna put that already marinated chicken cutlet one that screaming hot pan you're gonna cook it on one side for a minute to a minute and a half and then after that you're gonna flip it and let it cook another minute to a minute and a half so you see that color on both sides then you're gonna reduce the heat to low you're gonna cover it and you're gonna let it cook an additional 10 minutes and what we're gonna end up with is the most flavorful juicy moist chicken possible so at this point all we have left to do is plate we went ahead and mix the sauce and the pasta together so that way the flavors can marry and that pasta can't get all coated you gonna get that you [Music] I remember you can keep the chicken whole or you can cut it up in slices maybe you want to mix it up in your sauce it really depends on you we prefer our slice a little bit for you you can also garnish with a little faith and you have cheese you know how much better than mother someone says look drag good you mean you'll miss that sharp cheddar melted all over top of it you're right - this is amazing we want to thank you guys so much for joining us today on butter and brown we're gonna take this and enjoy it by the pool we'll see y'all later peace [Music] synthetics better blow and that is all [Music]
