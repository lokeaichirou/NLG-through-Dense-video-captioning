 hey welcome to singing koukin Sanjeev Kapoor is khazana and my name is her Pal Singh today I am going to share a beautiful recipe with you a lot of people have requested me chef why don't you share your traditional restaurant style mutton rogan Russia although Kashmiri mutton rogan josh is something with the Kashmiri cook with great passion and is not what is served in the restaurants mind you in restaurants we have a recipe with all shapes across the world have kind of tempered the way I am doing it today is one of the best-selling restaurant recipes of Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants and that's where I am working for you know he's my mentor also and from whom we have learned a lot of good things and here is the beautiful recipe oil is hot we've got some whole spices cinnamon clubs five to six clubs big cardamom bay leaf two of them all into this oil is nice and hot onions equal quantity of onions if you are using 1 kg of cotton you need to use 1 kg of sliced onions and that's a very important part of the recipe and you need to brown this onions while this onions get brown let me also share with you what exactly a Kashmiri Rogan Josh is another Wasa's as the cooks of Kashmir are known the visage and vast ones they are very passionate about cooking meat traditionally in Kashmir they use a ingredient called rotten joke which gives a beautiful red color to the mutton roma juice and it's cooked in mustard oil mind you with lot of asafoetida they keep heating the mustard oil and keep adding the asafoetida and the fennel powder first report' they add the mutton so asafoetida and fennel powder and then they marvel and the ginger-garlic paste are added in Kashmiri Rogan juice and it's very very dry unlike what we see in restaurants me in restaurants we see nice red thick beautiful rich gravy made out of button stock and mutton cooked in it with Kashmiri chilies and that's what I'm sharing with you today lot of people on the internet have requested me that chef why don't you share one of your traditional mutton rogan juice recipes this is what I am doing the onions are now made where to Brown in keep stirring in between so that they get evenly colored and you need to be watchful onions need to be just golden brown and not be brown because if they are browned more than what is required you get a burnt flavor so golden brown is the color and you need to keep stirring continuously to get that color also uniformly and it's also very important that when you do dishes like this and you want the onions to be brown the onions need to be sliced finely and when it is sliced finally which means you need to have a good sharp knife be careful about your fingers there the onions now as you see are nice and chest prompt the color that I require and at this point of time the onions are nice and sweet so we need to quickly add ginger-garlic paste the garlic paste 1 tablespoon and the ginger paste 1 tablespoon of this to this I'm going to add my button I'll brace the button for some time for about two to three minutes till the time it's evenly colored and then we'll add some water and cook until the button is nice and soft in the restaurant style mutton rogan juice that I do I keep it plain and simple very less spices the gravy needs to be nice and rich instead of water you could add stock if you are cooking in your restaurants you know the stock could be of Trotters or chicken bones now the button as you see is now little brown what I'm going to do now is add some water since I don't have stock at this point of time and even at homes I am sure we all don't use mutton stock so water enough to cook the mutton at this point of time I'll add some salt also taste as much as you require give a gentle stir what do you need to do is cover and cook until the mutton is soft which is almost more than 80% of the mutton scoop then we will add the rest of the ingredients so what I'm going to do cover and cook this would take about 20 to 25 minutes and mutton would be just about done that's the time we will add the rest of the spices so let us now check the mutton Oh ice color the brown onions I have given a good color to the gravy the mutton is almost there now so let us have the spices I keep it very simple when I cook mutton rogan juice in my restaurant and I'm going to create trick that I do in my restaurants I use Kashmiri chilli powder and I add water first before adding it to the gravy directly I never added directly because you know psychically it said all the oils get blended with the water there are a few chili powders in India which add not of color but they are not spicy hot one of them is Kashmiri chilli powder the other one that I know is made get chilli does not add too much of spice but adds a lot of color here of course it's the gravy that is getting cooked but if you were to add the chillies directly they would get burnt very important to mix it with little water and that's the trick into the Rogan Josh nice red color I've got some fennel powder half a teaspoon I've also got some ginger powder half a teaspoon of ginger powder mix this up thoroughly you see the nice red colour that's coming that's come through the red chilli that I have used you see suddenly the colour has erupted in the Rogan juice beautiful colour finally some brisk yogurt 1/2 a cup of RISP yogurt I do not add tomatoes at all in my grave and Rogan Josh in my response sells like hotcakes and this is what the trick is I also prefer straining the gravy after cooking the mutton it gives a nice good shame to the gravy you know the beautiful shine but if you are cooking at home never mind you could serve it directly like this to your guests so let's cook this for 10 more minutes for the gravy to be nice and thick 10 minutes of cooking along with the yogurt and spices button is now ready to be served what a bowl here see the color beautiful color you get from Kashmiri chilli that I've used but in this book the best thing of cooking a mutton is it should be buttery you know and if it is not cook well then you never enjoy it the place that I have learnt my food from hide the bud people always say that you should be able to choose the mutton but in Lucknow they say the mutton should be soft as butter so in India all over people have different you know their sayings and feelings about dishes but I feel mutton should be buttery in a Roven jours nice and soft mutton rogan Joe's for millions of my users who are being searching for this recipe and have requested this recipe number of times that's why I thought best to share this recipe with y'all this is how we cook in our restaurants you try in your restaurants or at your home and enjoy this with long grain basmati rice or a good food in a paratha beautiful just for you mutton oven douche you
