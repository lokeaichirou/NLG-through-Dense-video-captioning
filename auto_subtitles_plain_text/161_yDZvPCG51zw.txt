 welcome to La Cucina Anna Maria I'm Anna Maria de Freitas owner of the Harrison house wheats Tucker House Inn and coho restaurant and Friday Harbor San Juan Island Here I am in Pelle Indaba lavender fields Pelle Indaba is the premier manufacturer of lavender and lavender products here on San Juan Island and probably throughout the nation today I'm gonna demonstrate how to make a traditional lamb shish kabob also infused with lavender so I'm gonna start with some oregano you could use fresh or ground some freshly ground cumin and some culinary lavender if you look to my left you will see the green rose that's the culinary lavender it's been harvested probably about three weeks ago and then the buds are dried and I will use that as part of this marinade lavender is a great herb that works well with lamb I think about using lavender any place that I would use rosemary so I'm just going to grind this up and pulverize it and you can see that the buds are now turning to fibers give it a few more turns okay and we'll add 2 spoon of that and I have some smoky paprika we'll add that to the bowl and I pinch a white pepper and some garlic cloves I've just lightly diced them and chopped them up good pinch of salt and just a little bit of olive oil to hold everything together and give it a stir can I have some local lamb here that I've just cubed I'm gonna put this on the rub these are great kebabs serve with a little cheesy key and some grilled flatbread I would let this sit overnight or you can just get ready to grill them I have some lavender grill sticks you can see they use everything of the plant so after they harvested harvest the buds whatever's left the sticks are great for kabobs you can also use them for smoking so I'm going to thread the lamb on here and these will be getting ready for the grill sometimes the grill sticks work a little easier for something that's not so quite as fibrous as lamb great for chicken perfect for scallops shrimp and then just imparts a nice flavor these are ready for the barbecue I hope you enjoy your traditional lamb shish kabobs Bon Appetit you
