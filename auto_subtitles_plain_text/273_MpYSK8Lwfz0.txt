 [Music] you're watching cooking recipes tv.com chef Brian here come on in let's have some fun today we're cooking a French classic beef Burgundy also known as beef in Burgundy this classic recipe has been passed down for generations and generations now I'm bringing it to your kitchen let's get cooking we're going to start off with two pounds of all-natural and cut stew beef I'm gonna sear this with some fresh cracked black pepper as well as some kosher salt after I seared the beef and seasoned it well I'm gonna Sonjay the beef now what that means is that is a French terminology and it's if it needs to add a bit of flour to the beef which will ultimately thicken up our stew as it cooks to that we're going to add an entire bottle of red wine I'm gonna add some organic beef broth now when I was in culinary school and working in the hotels one of the things I really love to do it sounds strange I'm sure for you a lot of people was to make a classic feel stuff or beef stock roasting of the bones and the thyme in the preparation 12 to 24 hours for a finished product and I can tell you that there's nothing like a good sauce or a good stew that's made with a homemade stock it's just not practical in the home kitchen I find if you use a good quality broth you can get almost as close nothing wrong with these types of products into that we're going to add some sauteed pearl onions the classic dish combines mushrooms which you certainly can add as well as pearl onions sous-chef Amanda not so big on the mushrooms so we skip them here finally I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the other additions to the classic beef burgundy home and the classic beef Burgundy oftentimes bacon is added the bacon is sauteed off and then the beef is then Sur browned if you would in the bacon fat this this gives the beef an excellent flavor as well as helps with the caramelization and coloring of the piece however we're trying to cook healthy in 2008 we're both working out and staying fit so instead I sear the beef off in a canola vegetable oil it's just a bit healthy for more healthy for you so something to think about let's go ahead and let's get cooking I've gone ahead and I've got all my you plate ups on a half sheet pan you know when we go ahead and now notice cracked pepper guys really makes a huge difference the stuff you reach up from you in your jar and it's already cracked it just doesn't have that flavor of fresh cracked black pepper so really is a lot tastier and then a little bit of kosher salt you can season it pretty well it'll soak it up pretty good so we'll mix it up just to bed so go ahead and move it around and then give it one more little bit of salt in pepper salt salt and pepper and that looks pretty fantastic our beef is well seasoned we'll move that over to the left and that starts at 10 8 so when we're sauteing our searing we want to get the pan extremely high I'm going to kick up my fan here so I don't smoke my house sell it and then I'm gonna put a little oil in and I think we can even like let's see how how we are we're getting there but I'm gonna actually give it a couple more seconds to get searing hot and then we're gonna cook off this beat if sous chef Amanda can get a shot at the beef again I'm going to go ahead and put the meat box probably in about four batches the goal here is to really get a nice dark color on the beat which is going to help color our stew so what's to be deserted give it a couple seconds before you word around the idea to keep your pan hot and sear each side so it's been cooking now about two minutes or so and I'm going to move this keep around a little bit and then I'm gonna let it fit once again and this looks pretty good as you can see it's getting a nice sear on it right now so what I'm going to do is half the beef is about half done and I've got such a big pan I got an additional room so I'm going to search some other beef over on this side so the pan doesn't get too hot and I can still maintain the temperature in my pants keep moving the beef around and as you can see we're getting some nice color on that first batch I'm not going to even think about the lap when there's just one end and this keeps a deep sauteing your beef until it gets very well browned after the beef is fully brown we're going to have this panel with all these great pan Jews so we're going to be glazed with some of that red one I don't need to pour all of it in the pan just enough to basically pick up those pan drippings and lose some look you loosen them up then I'll go ahead and get a little straight juice into our crock pot correctly then it cooks this beef bourguignon in the crock pot which makes this really simple and you don't have to worry about others and things like that just really getting some you know to be stared off first so get ready with your red one alrighty so let's the glaze the pan it's still steaming hot that's okay just as long as we get the wine in there right away so and move that around like that but let it reduce for a couple of seconds I can come here I can turn the heat off completely and we'll just add that to the beat once I've gone ahead and saw Shane the beat in the crock pot so our beat goes into our crock pot now before you start sauteing turn your crock pot on get it on high setting and see all those drippings just give it a second - so they're tasty and delicious from here this is where we talk about sunjai [Music] tablespoons and then a couple more tablespoons and just continue to incorporate the flour while mixing it around this way your feet will get evenly coated with the flour and you won't have a lumpy stew at the end of the day when your beef is ready so as you can see the flour is completely coated the beef that's exactly what we want from here go ahead and add the rest of the entire bottle of red wine and guys don't skimp on this step you want a lot of red wine all right guys remember those pan drippings mmm so good that red wine so move your beef around with the red wine for several minutes until it starts to get hot once you see it start to boil then you can go ahead and stir a bit more and incorporate the beef broth using a whole thirty-two ounce container of beef broth we serve the beef bourguignon at the Johnson household with mashed potatoes as well as oven roasted carrots and pearl onions the one a roasts the carrots and onions in a preheated oven 400 degrees toss the vegetables in a light amount of olive oil with kosher salt and pepper hey these to us with cooking all day long it's getting tender it's very nice no it's time to adjust the seasonings and that means tasting this seems really important you need to know what you're serving to your friends and family on a special night so grab a spoon and taste that tastes pretty good but it does need a bit more salt so I'm just going to add a bit now and I add very gradually in that continue to taste fresh cracked black pepper would be nice so the beef bourguignon is really shaping up fantastic our pearl onions and carrots are roasting in the oven we've got some homemade mashed potatoes that we'll be serving with the beads soon this is comfort food folks great in the winter time and really salsa so then my friends is beef bourguignon on Americana style stay saucy and keep cooking this is chef Roy and I'll see on
