 hi I'm Moscow I'm from Moscow's kitchen I will show you how to make noodle noodles in the soup so it'll noodle is made from wheat flour and water it's kind of a thick and chewy texture of the noodle so there are a few different types of noodle I'm going to introduce you so those are in a different package or different forms so you will find how to use for many different cuisine so they are frozen and half boiled and a dried noodles available so you cook so you cooked noodle noodles in same way but you will cook a different time for example the dried noodle would be longer than half boiled noodles or frozen noodles so we're going to boil the dried noodles in a boiling water you follow the package instructions the timing would be like 10 to 12 or 30 minutes so you cook the half boiled noodles in the boiling water about three minutes but it's um while you're cooking you disentangled the noodle ways using your chopsticks so I'm going to boil the frozen noodle noodle put in a boiling water the same process to disentangled while you simmering or just a while your boiling noodle noodle and it won't take more than three minutes just um when it becomes hot and then strain the water after the udon noodles are boiled you just start wash under the cold water to stop cooking if you don't use thread way to the cooking so next step is going to be making a dashi stock so the dashi stock is already made but you can actually make your own - he stopped from kombu and Katsuobushi the bonito flakes so so kena kombu in the water half an hour and then lettuce I just start with cold water and they start bringing it to the boil then when it's just before start boiling take the convert out because Congo gets quite slimy and a bitter flavor goes into the water then you just pour the cuts over here on the top of kombu dashi stock and then you just simmer two minutes and strain the dashi so that's how it's made Pasi stock so bring in light soy sauce and mirin and a little of salt and then I'm going to bring it to the boil so now I'm going to add cooked noodles in a soup but are you actually you can add a half cooked half boiled noodle or frozen noodles in stock soup this is now ready to serve so serve in a large bowl soup bowl and then topping it will add on top so here toppings I prepared a carrot cut into flour kind of shape you can use a cookie cutter instead of them just a flower shape okay so next to it we we aren't chives really finely chopped and sesame sesame seeds toasted sesame seeds and then also nori strips so last one is the seven spices it's called Jimmy so Japanese seven spices are added include some ginger dried ginger sesame black sesame and a Chinese kind of pepper and mainly it has red chili now it's ready to serve that's how to make noodle noodles in soup
