 hello everyone good afternoon please welcome two easy steps of Indian Punjabi style cooking I'm going to Omega roti chapati a tortilla I'm going to show you both ways one is the traditional way there is no electronic equipment or anything involved and I'm going to show you how to do it I'm just going to roll up my sleeve and you get the water I'm using a flour wheat flour you add up water and you just mix it up this one is pretty much done and her hand and with your knuckles you roll it up and agita if I can close him and you mash it it goes off and then you can bring it down and then you lift it up and put it it again then you work on other way around one way and let me show you the other way see it's already done let me show you the other way yeah hi this is what we did by hand I'm going to show you by the machine since we have all these machines to do the work for us not that we get lazy but actually they do all to perform my humans and they do better job and I had the flour in the machine so I'm gonna bring the water according to and I'm going to just put them on a speed one and I'm slowly slowly I'm gonna add water so he's gonna do the job so it's um almost 1 glass of water a little bit olive oil not too much very little boys almost ready rim is gonna become like a ball that gives you indication it's already already and we're gonna pull it out you know the boys are ready I'm going clock the dough is ready this is what we did by hand this is what we did by machine so I'm going to show you how we gonna do this you get a flower you put your finger in there so basically you're coding your fingers towards they won't stick to it of dough and roll it up and once you roll it up it becomes like this then you take the ball into the order of e then use this a little bit flour again and you do it to the trick is when you're using the roller if we you you roll it slowly if you roll it slowly if you notice that the dough itself is the start its return so when it's a turning it automatically it should go like turning and it becomes a minimal wrong shape um you got your griddle and you put it in there you see how the little color gonna change once once it's gonna be a little bit the color get gonna change then you're going to put your finger underneath you're gonna turn it around fingers say you know they are very delicate they get a you know try to Bonnie you can use like a spatula so once you see is done on other side then you can use the same pattern you go like this slowly slowly you see how it coming up how beautiful see how it turned out so you're going to rotate little bit around this will perfect even now you got visit to the restaurant you won't find it like this kind of roti now see that's the perfection of roti and once it's done I'm going to share with you sir another thing that tortilla can be eaten like this but there are a lot of people of prefer little bit further on it to tr rooty we just made it fresh homemade rooty it's very easy to make thank you very much
