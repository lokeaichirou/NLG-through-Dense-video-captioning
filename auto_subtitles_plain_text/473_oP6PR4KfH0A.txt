 ready all right we're going to talk about how to make the best onion rings you've ever had what you want to do is start off with a really big yellow onion the bigger the better when it comes to onion rings now what we're going to do is we're going to cut the onion rings really really thick the thicker the better on this deal you want to be careful to watch out for your fingers though if you don't cut them completely straight no big deal big onions little onions they'll all work now we want to push the onions out you want to be careful to try not to break the onion rings if you break them no big deal but we're trying to be traditional here what you want to do is put the onions in a bowl and now we're going to put water and milk in the bowl about a 50/50 mixture what you want to do is make sure your onions are completely submerged in your water milk mixture I use skim milk if you use 2% or 1% no big deal what we're going to do now is set those aside and let them soak for a little bit when cooking just onion rings I use vegetable oil a lot of times cooking turkey I like to use peanut oil as you'll see I'm using a cast iron pot I really like to use cast iron for cooking because it retains heat a lot better and a Big O thermometer thermometers are very important because you want to make sure you keep your heat within a certain range right here we're using the Camp Chef Explorer cooker this is a really nice cooker because it's portable and it gets really hot it'll push about 60,000 BTUs alright now it's time to get our flour ready this is pretty complicated okay so pay attention all right flours done what we're going to do is we're going to do a two-step process on our dip all this consists of is buttermilk and milk it's about a 60/40 mixture there's really no precise mixture on this the more buttermilk you use and the less milk you're going to have a thicker batter stir it up a little bit with the old Leatherman not quite to 350 yet got a little bit ways to go but it won't take long that's for sure all right I wasn't kidding about the flower it's very very simple the key to remember is you do not put anything in your flower okay you always season afterwards when you fry all right what we want to do now is we're going to take the onions into the flower what this process is this process is a dry wet dry process meaning you put the onions in the flour first then you go wet which is into our buttermilk milk mixture and then we're going to go back into the flour what this does it helps ensure a good batter on our onion rings you don't want to batter just once so we go into the buttermilk back into the flour and you can kind of see it almost looks like a paper mache plaster I mean yet that onion is back in the flour it's really got a good coat of flour and just looks really really sticky so what we can do now is we can now roll the onion rings again in the flour and our batter is going to be twice as thick again you can control the thickness that your batter by either using more buttermilk less milk or you can cut it thinner to where it's not going to get as thick onion right there that's a good looking coat we're not too thick we're not too thin this is an example of a single batter versus a double batter you can really see that there's just a lot more of threading on the onion with a double batter and again I'm not saying that we want to get as thick as possible I'm not a fan of an onion ring that's covered in lots of batter all right we have reached temperature 350 degrees into the Greece we go man those are gonna be good and while they're done now they don't the onion rings don't take very long and you can tell that they are done when they turn a nice golden brown and you'll see the batter kind of start to separate from the onion drain the grease off now here's the here's the important part as soon as you pull them out of the grease you want to season them immediately what this is going to do is going to help the season to stick to the onion ring but it also helps draw a lot of that grease that surface grease out of the engine and the seasoning we're using is field-proven camp shake this seasoning is a it's a flavor enhancer it's not very overpowering it's great on everything but it actually brings the flavor out of the onion itself this is a great seasoning you want to kind of flip the onions over and batter both sides so that way you get a good coat and while those onions cool down let's go ahead and throw a few more in the cooker cast iron is great for cooking it's very durable and it holds heat well look at that maintaining 350 no problem I like to use a big look scoop for getting onions out so that way the onions don't necessarily just sit in the grease while you're trying to pull them out when they're all done at the same time you kind of want to get them out so that way you're not pulling them one at a time and they ones that are left in the oil burn this scoop is actually I think it's my wife's ice fishing scoop for when she used to live up in Iowa she's an important to Kentucky from Iowa so the ice fishing scoop works great as a is a frying scoop not much ice in Kentucky that's for sure as you can see the batter is got a nice coating of batter it's not real thick it's not like biting into a hushpuppy you can even see some of the onion exposed and the best part is is what you're about ready to see is the reason we soak these onions before we cook them is because I despise an onion ring that when you bite into it the onion pulls out we don't want that we want to take a bite and get equal amount of onion and batter we don't want to scald our lips with some onion pulling out of the ring you can put a little dipping sauce down really you can use anything you like ketchup barbecue sauce whatever this here this sauce here I found at Dollar General actually it's called blossom sauce it's pretty daggone good though there you go here's a test of a good onion ring when you bite in the onion the onion does not pull out my gosh those are good that there is field-proven seasoning camp shake onion rings give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed thanks for watching
