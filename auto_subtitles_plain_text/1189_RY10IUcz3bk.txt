 hi YouTube it's your girl love kisses 99 and I'm coming to you today with my second recipe of the day and this is a recipe for macaroni and cheese this is going to make a large pan of macaroni and cheese so it's for more than two or three people it's kind of like for one of those Affairs you go to and you have to take a dish so just stay tuned okay you okay so now I have the macaroni that's already been drained and I'm gonna put in three tablespoons of butter just this over here I'm gonna stir the butter in you can use margarine you can use some Country Crock whichever you know is your favorite you can most certainly use that so just stir this in and it's gonna melt because the macaroni is still hot and now I'm gonna take a jar of Cheez Whiz and I'm gonna put this in and this is gonna melt as well because the macaroon like I said it's still hot and this recipe it might be too much piece for you but this is the way my sons like it so this is kind of the only way that I make it so I'm just stirring in that cheese whiz so mixing this is gonna take me a minute so I'm going to mix it all together and I'll be right back and show you the rest of the process okay so the cheese is all those cheese's is all incorporated so now I'm gonna take regular milk and I'm gonna pour this in Sturgess tonight and now we're just going to assemble our macaroni and cheese just so I have 2 cups of mild cheddar and I have 4 cups of sharp cheddar the reason that I use it and with you know like that is because there's already mild cheese in it so you want to give it just a little bit of a bite with the sharp cheese so this is how we're gonna force the macaroni in this is a really cheesy recipe this way they'll be cheese and I'm going to take quite a bit of the sharp spread that around there's add some more the macaroni and it's just the same process bread the macaroni around and then we're going to use more cheese and just keep away arrangements for you're all finished seems like my son's like actually more cheese than macaroni in their macaroni and cheese and then I'm just going to clip the rest of the macaroni right on the top you might have to mash it down a little bit because it is going to be a full pan and make sure when you put it in the oven that you put it on maybe a cookie sheet so that way if there's any drips or anything you won't have to worry about that it's a clean your stove once you're done okay and I'm going to put this aside and now we're going to add the rest of the key right this way when I think that have a nice crust on the top from the cheese so what I'm gonna do is put this in the oven on 350 to 375 for approximately 45 minutes with the foil on after the 45 minutes are up I'm gonna take the foil off and just let it cook on the top so that it gets a nice even browning on the top and you can even put it like right under your broiler but watch that closely because the broiler has a tendency to work really fast and it will burn your food if you have you're not watching closely so I'm gonna drop this in the oven and I'll be back to show you the end result you okay and here we have dinner all done we have the red beans and rice we have some collard greens here the macaroni and cheese and some baked chicken so I'm really hoping you enjoy your dinner and hoping you have a good day today and I'll see you again soon bye you
