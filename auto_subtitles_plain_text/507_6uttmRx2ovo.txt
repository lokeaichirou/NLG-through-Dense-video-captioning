 hi I'm Anya welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to share with you a recipe for another pair of ghee those are my favorite we call it pierogi ruskie which would mean Russian puree and they are made with pressed cottage cheese onion and potatoes and again the recipes from my mom let's have a look at the ingredients so you know what you I am starting with preparing my potatoes I'm going to peel them off okay and then I'm going to cut them in half just to make them easier for a Pollock Cayden in my large pot I added water and some salt and now I'm adding my potatoes and I'm going to be boiling them for around half an hour until they are tender and I'm going to be checking them with the fork if they are easily sliding off then means they are ready okay so let's fish them out and then we letting them cool a little bit so it's easier to handle them and in the meantime we take care of our onion I'm going to chop it very finely okay and then on my frying pan and adding around two tablespoons of oil and then on a medium medium heat I'm adding my onion and I'll be cooking it for around five minutes I think until it gets nice and soft in transparent and starts turn turning cold here yeah that's how it looks like when it's ready now my potatoes cool down a little bit I don't want them to be cold because then it's harder to press them but they are still warm but not burning and I'm pressing them through my potato press and then I'm pressing my cheese and when this is ready I am transferring everything into my larger mixing bowl and then adding the onion okay and now it's time for mixing here we're going to be mixing it until all its nicely incorporated okay I'm checking for seasoning and then adding salt and pepper girag you'll scare I have to be nicely salted not too much but they cannot be not enough salted and they need pepper as well I didn't put too much just because I'm hoping Sebastian will eat some but in the recipe you should you should put more okay and then I'm switching to work the staffing with my hands okay and I'm working it until I'm sure that everything is well mixed up okay and then into my food processor processor I'm adding my flour and I have boiled water ready in my mag it's not boiling hot but it's still warm I'm adding a teaspoon of salt and now I'm going to pulse it a little bit so the salt will mix with the flour and when this is ready slowly I'm going to be adding the water watching what's happening with the dough and when the when the dough is forming a bowl and then it's ready we don't need any more water and I will check also if it's soft enough and if it is soft enough then we still wanna run it for around 1 minute in the food processor processor so it gets nice and elastic here we go unchecking the fifth license solved but it needs a 30 seconds 45 seconds more okay when this is done in my large pod I added water I'm adding a teaspoon of salt and I want to bring it to boil while I'm working on my dough okay so this is half of the of the dough the other half I packed up nicely in a ziplock bag so it doesn't dry out go it's nice and the last take you put some flour if you need if it's a little bit sticky put more flour but in my case it was not sticking to the table and then with the rolling pin we're going to be rolling it and I think it should be between one and two millimeters but it does depends on what you like my mom likes the match dinner I like them a little bit thicker that's how my grandma used to make a Rakhi but it's a lot of a lot of rolling we go and from time to time we want to flip the foot flip the dough over so it doesn't stick to our table in from the half of the half half of the dough it's going to be around 20 20 P rock on my serving plate I'm putting some flour because I'm going to be putting my Parag either and I don't want them to get stuck I have my stuffing ready and right now with the glass I'm cutting circles go when that's ready I'm going to remove the remaining dough and I'm going to stuff it in a little ziplock bag so I can roll it again and then have few more pierogies now I have my knife scoop pick one tablespoon size and I'm picking up my dough stretching it a little bit flipping it over so the site which was laying on the table right now it's on top so it's easier to close it it feels better okay and for this pillow gee I don't like to have any decoration the pirogue it'll scare for me looks best when they are just simple like this okay and again tbsp of stuffing and we stretching our dough and sealing it don't put too much of stuffing because if it touches the edges then you won't be able to to seal the pirogue now our bottom water it's boiling so we're going to be to be putting all our pirogue inside just make sure that you don't crowd it too much you need to have a big part and then after that we need to give it a gentle stir with the wooden spoon just so they don't get stuck to the bottom of the pot okay and my plate I'm going to spray with a nonstick spray and have it ready for the pierogi when they float to the top another 1 minute and they are ready here we go and off they go to the plate ok and here goes the last one and right now we need to put some some oil on top of our yogi I'm spraying just a nonstick spray but my mom using a brush and just brushing them you could also use the batter if you prefer okay and for serving I'm chopping up some bacon and some onion into small pieces here we go this is my best way of serving it it's with with fried bacon with some onion but you can just fry simply buradu by themselves or you can say serve them fresh from the water with some sour cream okay now on my frying pan I'm putting the bacon and I'm going to be cooking it until it gets nice and crisp okay give it a stir from time to time so it doesn't get stuck to your frying pan and when the bacon is almost ready and I'm adding my onion and now I'm going to be cooking it until the onion turns kind of golden brown and it's soft and caramelized and then we just pour it over our pierogi and voila that's how it looks like I hope you enjoyed the recipe and you give it a try let me know what you think and I will see you next time bye you
