 [Music] hi I'm Stephanie jour ski of joy baking calm today we're going to make pancakes this is a really easy batter to make you only need two bowls one for the wet ingredients and one for the dry and we'll start with the dry ingredients in a large bowl place one cup that's about 130 grams of white all-purpose flour and the flour will give us a structure to the pancakes and then we're going to add two tablespoons about 30 grams of granulated white sugar and the sugar will give a sweetness plus moistness and also helps with the Browning of the pancakes and then we're going to add one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and this will provide light and airiness to the pancake and then lastly a quarter teaspoon of salt which helps bring out all the flavors and then I'm just going to whisk this all together to combine you don't want any lumps and then through the wetting ingredients you want them all at room temperature and I'm going to use one large egg and I'm going to just whisk that now the egg will bind all the ingredients together plus it helps with richness and with browning of the pancakes and to that I'm going to add two tablespoons that's about 30 grams of melted butter and have that at room temperature and the butter gives nice moistness to the pancakes and a richness and of course helps with the flavor and lastly one cup that's 240 milliliters of milk now you could use whole milk 2% or even skim and just keep in mind that the higher the fat content of your milk of course the richer in flavor the pancakes will be I'm just using a 2% here so just gently whisk this together okay and we're done we'll just now all we got to do is just make a well in the scent of your dry ingredients and pour your wet into the center there now to get a nice tender pancake we just want to mix the ingredients together just until everything's moistened you don't want to get too much gluten developed so you don't want to be really vigorously stirring this as you can see this is easy to make now if you wanted to the night before you could get all the dry ingredients put together in One Bowl and just cover that with plastic wrap and then you could even put all the wet ingredients together and cover and put that in the fridge and then just mix it together now we just want to stir this until moistened now don't worry if there's some lumps that's okay okay so that's our batter now I'm going to use here an electric griddle if you have one of these set it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius if you don't have one of these you can just use a frying pan on the stove and set your heat to medium medium-high heat and try to use a frying pan that it's pretty heavy-duty that has a flat bottom because you don't want warps and then you'll have uneven cooking of the pancakes and then you know your pan is ready like on the stove if you take a little drop of water and just put it on it would kind of sputter then you'll know your pans ready and you may have to adjust the heat as you're you're cooking your pancakes if you're they doing too fast or not browning enough you can just put your heat up or down now I'm just going to use a nonstick cooking spray that kind of keeps your you're worried about your fat so just keep it down you could also just rub the your pan with either with a brush or with a piece of paper towel oil or melted butter so I'm going to use a ladle to make my pancakes and you could also put your batter in a large measuring cup and then just pour it on whichever way you want and of course you can make your pancakes as big or as small as you want just make sure that you space them a little bit apart because as you know the batter will spread a bit just keep that in mind so let's make about that large I'll just do a couple of course I could probably do more on this pan but and then because if you're using a nonstick surface make sure you use something that you don't want to use a stainless steel that will scratch your surface and then when to flip them as you can see the pancake will start to get lots of bubbles and craters and when the surface is pretty well covered with the bubbles and some of them are starting to burst then you know it's time to flip and you can also just take your spatula and kind of put under and just check to make the underside is you want them nice and golden brown that takes maybe two three minutes depending on your heat which as I said you can adjust if you're finding it's not browning enough okay as you can see there's lots of bubbles on the top surface and some of them have popped so I'm going to flip this and then just you can see nice golden brown as you can see you can adjust the color by how soon you flip it and then just cook it on the other side now the the second side will not Brown as much as the first side so just keep that in mind so it's take ya 1/2 minutes more you want to make sure they're cooked all the way through okay as you can see the second side is not quite as brown now when your pancake when you take them off the heat I'm there is a tendency because it looks cool to stack them all up one on top of the other but don't do that because what happens is the bottom ones get all soggy so try to have a plate or a platter like this and just do it this way now if you weren't serving these right away so your family's still in bed you could just turn your oven to 175 degrees Fahrenheit that's about 80 degrees Celsius and just put these pancakes directly on the wire rack and they you can keep them there for about 15-20 minutes so now if I was you when you make more pancakes what I would do is again spray or put a little more oil or butter and just make another batch the same way is first and you could just serve these with butter and maple syrup or some people like Jam or just some powdered sugar sprinkled over top and if you have leftovers after you could just freeze them and then you can either reheat them in the oven or just put them in your toaster frozen and they're really pretty good so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]
