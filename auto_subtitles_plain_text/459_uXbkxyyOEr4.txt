 in this video I'm going to show you how to make delicious tempura prawns what you're going to need to marinate tempura prawns is some fish sauce some soya sauce some thick teriyaki sauce some seasoned oil and some garlic and of course Monro prawns now what I've done here is I have cleaned the prawn and left the tailpiece on and now what I'm going to do is cut three little slits here here and here three small slits one in here one end one of the middle and one of the other end so that when you deep fry it it doesn't curl up that will keep this prawn straight now that I've cut all the prawns you add them into a bowl and you add about two tablespoons of fish sauce one teaspoon of soya sauce 1 teaspoon of thick teriyaki sauce 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of seasoned oil three cloves of minced garlic you mix and allow to marinate for about at least minimum two hours to make the tempura mix simply mix a hundred grams of ready-made tempura mix flour with 160 milliliters of water like so and there you go now to fry the tempura prawns what you do is you pick it up by the tail dip it in to the mix into the Japanese breadcrumbs and then into the deep fryer you can do about two or three at the same time don't overload it and you want them to become a nice golden brown [Music] this is about the color we're looking for nice golden yellowish brown beautiful tempura bones [Music]
