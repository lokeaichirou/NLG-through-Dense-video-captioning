 hey what's going on it's lisa here raw food for kids hope you're having a super awesome day I sure AM and last couple days she's been keeping it real simple and I needed to make a video so I wanted to do something special for you guys so I thought of a Viennese sandwich that is just awesome it's very very popular I probably not pronouncing right so someone knows the crupper NCAA shin it's a band me I think it's it's called you'll know what it is when I start making it but it's a real traditional via MIDI sandwich and normally it's got some kind of meat product in it or tofu or something but in this case I'm just going to stop the sandwich full of a nice vegetables and everything so check this out it's a typically this vietnamese sandwich is got carrots in it um if I store had icon I would have gotten carrots and daikon but I'm using carrots I got some thinly sliced radishes I have a little mandolin but if you don't have a mandolin just slice all these really thin the carrot site i shredded so nice thin will shrimp I've got some a cucumber thinly sliced I've got a fresh mint fresh cilantro those are the herbs and then for the sandwich part for my for my bread typically it's made with a like cut one was like a baguette bread but I thought would work out really nice and be a little more sturdy so we could really pack is full of vegetables and some sauce we're going to make a chili lime mango sauce to go on it um I used some napa cabbage so I got the napa cabbage and then the ribs are really pretty I don't know you don't really want to eat them they're kind of hard so what I do is I just kind of chopped off the rib part and I'll say that for for something else but they say this is going to be my sandwich it's gonna be by my bread here and it's nice and Harvey so um let's make the sauce first and i'm sure i'd put together i mean this is very simple the amounts I mean you just cut up as much vegetables as you want to put in your sandwich and the sauce here I've got about a half of a really large mango if you use a lot of champagne or honey megas probably from one or two hands on a sauce you like generally of the condiments on the sandwich or mayonnaise like a chili like a chili sauce is typically put on there so I thought to kind of make it like a chili sauce I do some a little bit of a Fresno chili so I've got one of these it's about the same heat as a holic pina so whatever pepper you want to the spiciness I took out the ribs point that all in there instead of using honey or agave or anything I'm going to use this mango as my sweetness and then the juice of a half of line these lines haven't been very juicy so I'm going to put in three fourths of a line because that's what I've got it's really to taste you want the acidity to balance out the sweetness you could also just do chili and lime in here and then just squeeze some I have a lot of front lemon squeeze some lemon over top or some more lime this is going to be the sauce and I want it to be kind of thick the mango is going to make it really nice because again when you use all these vegetables and they're full of water and everything you want something that's going to stay on your sandwich all right so just pray this up yeah but one more piece of mango to make it yeah pretty color whoa I can smell that holy moly yeah let's make sure i'm not gonna kill us oh man that's the perfect balance that's awesome oh that's really good yummy so check this out all you do eating healthy is very simple and you can eat great food this is fat-free full of flavor you just want to take one of your little bread here and fill up I'm able to do the carrots put some carrots in there mmm put some cucumber and some radishes here no and I thought about maybe pickling some of the vegetables but you know you can do that too but I just want to do something quick and easy put some fresh mint in there the herbs are going to give it such a nice flavor no I check this out that might look awesome that what am I missing if i call that on there and then the sauce how thick that is that could lob with that on there oh man Mamma Mia look at that given nice sandwich but sure top on their band me that's what i'm calling i'm probably pronouncing it wrong but that's what I'm gonna call and you could even cut this if you wanted to let's see if I can yeah once after dinner go get yourself some of these ingredients and put it together are you doing put in together so that I live also and take a bite mmm totally holds together it should work out better and then Romanian leaves or something like that it's almost or you Oh ma'am mmm delicious a sauce because it's such a good play with the herbs excellent but it's stuff it as big as you want because many of these as you want so anyway hope you enjoy this one remember always eating happy foods happy for you to make you feel good I just wanted to mention that Jen I've been really working it hard to the gym lately and one thing
