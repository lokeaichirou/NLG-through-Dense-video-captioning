 hi cat's cradle here I wanted to make something authentic and delicious for my family for st. Patrick's Day so I decided to make cold canon a lot of dishes we serve for st. Patrick's Day are not authentic but this one is I'm using potatoes that I can't about a year and a half ago and they look beautiful i drained the potato water off for this recipe but you can bet that if we were in times of scarcity I would probably be using that potato water for something else like to make bread so I've drained them off and I have them in a small pan with some milk to reheat and when they're nice and bubbly hot then I turned the element off under the pot here in another cast-iron skillet I am heating up about a tablespoon of rendered bacon drippings and adding about 1/2 of the head of sliced cabbage my pot is really hot I go ahead and get all of the cabbage in there and that's about what this puddle hold is about a half a head of cabbage and this was a really big head by the way and I have my fire on really high because I want to fry this really quickly I turn it down just a little bit if I see any little starch pieces on the cabbage because I don't really want that I just want to cook very quickly the potatoes are just about hot and I want the cabbage pretty well pretty well cooked for this dish I'm gonna add some purple onion here white is actually my choice for this dish since we're Michigan mixing it in mashed potatoes and sometimes purple onions will make a dish look muddy if you can you know if you can really see them but they they worked out okay I just didn't want to slice into a new onion when I had this one that was half used in the freezer already so I just keep stirring it around and what I'm looking for is for the cabbage to be very very wilted and for the purple onions to begin to get tender I just keep stirring to make sure nothing burns or scorch is on the bottom and I'm just going to wait now for the onions to soften up I'm going to also add just a little bit of water to help it steam a little faster when they're wilted when the greens are wilted like I want then I add some salt and some fresh cracked pepper this is true peasant food this is Irish peasant food but is absolutely delicious and it's one of those things that is very authentic a lot of things we eat for st. Patrick's Day are not authentic but this is and so I'm going to add some salt and pepper to the potatoes as well I've changed burners brought the potatoes to the front and push the cabbage to the back because now I want to mash the potatoes and so I just use this handheld potato masher going all around getting all the lumps out that looks really good now I'm going to add just a little bit of butter and incorporate that these are things we really love we love potatoes and we love cabbage and onions so they're just perfect together in my house we call this comfort food I'm now going to ladle the cabbage into the potatoes and we'll start stirring them together in an Irish household that was operating under very frugal conditions this meal this would have been eaten as a meal by itself if the folks would have had a little bit more money you can see me I'm sprinkling in one diced green onion here into the hot mixture if they would had a little bit more money in each serving of the colcannon they would have placed a poached egg right on top of it but in most cases it would have been eaten just like this so now I'm going to spoon it into my serving dish look how rich and beautiful that looks and it is as good as it looks it is it's just delicious I'm scraping out every little little last bit and now here is one more diced green onion sprinkled on top just for color and this is traditional to put a pad of button butter right in the center this is a great side dish or a meal all by itself I really hope you'll give it a try it's a little unusual we don't usually combine these two foods together but you really need to try it it's a great way to use the bounty from your garden as well I hope you liked this recipe until next time this is cat's cradle
