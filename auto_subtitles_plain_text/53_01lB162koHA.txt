 however I welcome to Nicko's kitchens what you want today's recipe request comes in from the Facebook user Johann Soren guard and he has asked me to make some rena schnitzel so let's get started it's good budget meals Monday what you want Wednesday fast food Friday Bashar so of course we're going to be using some veal traditionally that's what's used in a Venus schnitzel and the cut that I'm using here today is from the rib area it's a veal cutlet it's got great flavor to it you use whatever cut of veal steak that you like and whatever you can get your hands on you can also get your butcher to prepare it for you as well but I'm going to quickly show you how to get it nice and thin so what I've done is I've cut if you're using the cutlet like I am I've cut it off the bone so I've got rid of that part trimmed off the fat and then I'm going to put it into a snap lock bag and then I'm going to use a meat hammer and I'm going to hammer out the meat until it's nice and thin you can also use a pot to do this as well if you don't have a meat hammer to do it and this is the thickness you can see here this is the thickness that we are after not something you can see how you know we've gone from a steak that size and almost tripled it in size now you've seen me do this many times before I've set up a breading station because obviously we're going to be coating our veal in some flour some egg and also some breadcrumb but first I've got some flour now very important don't season the flour just normal plain flour and I'm going to grab our veal I'm just going to coat it in that flour it's very important also when you're doing venison it'll don't press anything in just you know get some flour put it on the top like that dust the excess off don't get your hands in and really press it all in the next step of course is some eggs and just got two egg yolks there's no milk there's no water just eggs and I'm going to lay the veal straight in there and get it nicely coated and lastly I've got some bread crumbs again they're not seasoned they're just ordinary bread crumbs make sure you use dried bread crumbs to this don't use fresh and I'm going to get our veal from our egg and again don't press it in you just want to put it on there like that okay that's exactly what we are after so just keep repeating that process with as many Venus nettles as you want to make now we're going to be cooking our schnitzel and in a large pan here I've got some butter now some of you will be saying some butter my god how much butter is that now traditionally this is done with butter and it's shallow fried and that's how it's done today a lot of restaurants and a lot of people will do deep fried in a canola oil or something like that which is a healthier alternative so I'm going to be placing our schnitzel in and because it is quite thin I only want to cook it for about three minutes a minute and a half each side the outside will be nice and golden brown do this over a medium to high heat so just check it out I've pulled out our Venus missile from the pan beautiful golden brown the smell is wonderful and look at that nice crust it's puffed up a little bit and that's exactly what we want now what are we going to serve with this normally I would serve a potato gratin with this because I think it goes great potatoes in this dish are just a match made in heaven I will pop a link to some potato gratin that I've made before in the description if you want to go and check out that video but what I'm going to serve this up with today are some boiled baby potatoes and I've just dressed them in a little bit of olive oil season them with some salt and pepper and then I've put some fresh herbs I've got some parsley some chives and and I've just popped it I've also got some dill and I've just mixed it through there and I'm going to be serving that up with this and of course it wouldn't be complete without a slice of lemon on the side and you're going to use that lemon you can pop it over the potatoes of course pop it over the schnitzel there and I tell you what guys this is dudes food it's my sort of food I love it let's get stuck into this bad boy so this is one of my favorite favorite dishes I absolutely love this let's give it a try oh there's there's no words it's just so tender and moist on the inside beautiful crispy and you know what the the lemon over it goes fantastically well I love this dish and like I said before sure you can do some healthier versions of it but you know what this is a real treat I love it please give this one a go it is awesome
