 Jeju reaches beef schnitzel with little zucchini wedges hi and welcome to cheeky reaches a beef schnitzel we're going to show you how to turn this beautiful organic lean beef schnitzel into a delicious crumb dish and serve it with a fresh garden salad from our garden I've showed you how to do the bread crumbs in a previous video ingredients are listed in the recipe box below so let's get started the first thing that we're going to do is just with our exes slightly they are going to be the glue that holds our crumbs onto our beef just give that a little whisk around and then we're going to tip that into a flat plate so we're just using a pasta plate there and put that on one side now we're just got a plessy bag without any holes in it we're going to add our flour to that our veggie salt and our freshly cracked pepper give that a little shake around and that is what we're going to dredge our meeting to assist Oh crumbs in sticking now bread crumbs are going into a flat plate now I subscribe to the wet hand dry hand theory so there's only four slices of bread here which is far too much for what we're doing there's enough there that we can freeze using a pudding or make stuffing for a chicken or a pocket of beef just put that to one side as well to tenderize our meat we're just going to lay it onto our board and give it a bit of a hard time and I'm pleased to announce Ben mystery of the missing meat mallet has been solved so we're just going to cover this with the worst plastic wrap on earth stuff is so thin and so ridiculous I can't believe they're still in a caterer suppliers because I have its flavouring just peel that off now turn this over and do the same thing on there side now you don't to read a newspaper through this but you do want to turn around it we're gonna cut these pieces of beef into half and they would be a lot easier to manage back onto our tree what's up our board immediately to give it meat you something okay yeah flowers well mixed with our Fiji salt and pepper we're just going to drop our pieces of beef in there and give it a good shake around we want every surface to be rolled rich with our flour doing it in a plastic bag like that it contains a lot of the mess provided of course your plastic bag isn't compromised by a hole and that's what you should have so we're gonna just drop that into our egg turn it over well wet with the beaten egg no dry bits because obviously the crumbs won't stick to drive it's quite slippery lifted out and we're going to lower it once it's drained off a bit straight into our fresh breadcrumbs I'm just using one hand put that in there like so pop our crumbs over the top if you've got one wet hand and one dry hand you won't end up with really really blobby fingers just press your crumbs on well and we're going to put this in the fridge for about 10 to 20 minutes just so those crumbs and that egg mixture can get to know each other well pristine and that's what you should have and continue with the rest while our stencils been having a little rest in the fridge we've just prepared our fresh garden salad with most of the ingredients from our garden okay over medium heat we're going to add our rice bran oil now and now without creating a pan you're just going to love it we're going to cook it until it's nicely browned on each side turning it once only and then draining it on some paper towel and top the next pieces in it's important not to overcrowd the pan because if you do they will go soggy and you won't end up with a nice crisp schnitzel now with our remaining oil we've got our zucchinis that we've sliced we just pop those into our egg they've just got a little bit of seasoned flour rich on them shake off any excess it doesn't matter if it's not a complete coating of egg so you don't overcrowd that either let's turn those over and pop them carefully into that now all you do is cook the coating on this I don't actually mind if the zucchinis are nice and crisp in fact I prefer they would be they're so fresh out of a gardener actually warm ideal accompaniment for this dish with some wedges of lemon or lime and that's all the waste you have of the egg and then your tiny bit of waste on flour as well so don't try to reuse this this is for the bean okay when that coating is starting to brown a bit there will be a few crumbs stuck to it from the schnitzel don't worry about that I heard you sort of like almost like an eggy zucchini on it tastes a lot better than it looks and it's all been quite a bit of better world so again there's not less waste just take care through Keeney wedges out now sprinkle those with a little extra veggie salt these are actually perfect as as tappers as well and they have a cheeky richer's beef schnitzel with a crunchy fresh garden salad some crusty fresh bread and a bottle of wine cheeky rich nozbe schnitzel with zucchini wedges okay shall we you did thanks for watching
