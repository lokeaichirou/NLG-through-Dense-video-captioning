 hello this is chef John for food wishes calm with it be incredibly easy and always popular vodka sauce doing it on some penne which is kind of traditional you could do this on spaghetti anything super easy to make and it starts with sauteing usually pancetta which is a nun smoked Italian bacon type product but I like to use bacon so you know call me a bad Italian or you know call me a good American but I like to use bacon it's got a little smoky flavor I think it works really well I actually have pepper bacon here so in about a tablespoon of olive oil I'm going to cook that on medium heat I'm gonna throw in a sprig of rosemary and when that gets looking just about like that I'm going to dump in a half a cup of vodka now stand back when you do that because it could flare up and it usually doesn't especially if you're using a pan the shape I'm using using a really shallow panic and flame up so be careful with that now whenever I make this I always think where did I get vodka I don't drink vodka I have two bottles of vodka in my freezer I've no clue where they came from so thank you vodka fairies so we're going to put that on high heat and when it gets down to a couple tablespoons left see that it's not evaporated but it's starting to bubble it's getting close we're going to dump in our cream that's heavy cream give that a swirl all right after the cream goes in we're going to add some black pepper you can add some hot red chili flakes if you want I'm going to go with some black pepper and as soon as that cream comes back to a boil we're going to cook that for about 3-4 minutes the cream is going to reduce see that it's going to thicken up slightly it'll kind of hold a mark at the bottom of the pan we don't want to over reduce it but we want to reduce it a little bit maybe by half I'm going to dump in 3 cups of prepared tomato sauce and about 3/4 of a cup of water that I washed out the jar with we're going to bring that to a simmer lower the heat and simmer that for about 20-25 minutes and it's going to be unbelievably delicious and it gets to be a really beautiful color in my opinion I don't like a ton of cream you notice I only put a half a cup I don't like the pink vodka sauces I look at a nice kind of brick red color like you see there all right so that's going to simmer away in the meantime we're going to boil our penne pasta in salted water I'm using the Barilla brand I like the multigrain and then you know the trick drain the pasta cook it one minute under what you normally would dump the hot sauce over it stir it around and then we're going to throw the lid on and let it sit for about five minutes and just relax it's going to soak up the sauce it's going to finish cooking and then we serve it with a little extra cheese on top vodka sauce really really delicious and you may have heard Alton Brown or one of those other food scientists guys say it but there's certain flavors in tomato that are only brought out if you introduce alcohol into the sauce so this is one of those that's why it has a really interesting taste you can use pancetta you can use bacon and you can make a vegetarian if you want so that's it penne pasta with vodka sauce I hope you give that a try all the ingredients are on the site and as always enjoy you
