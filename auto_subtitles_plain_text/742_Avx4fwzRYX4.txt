 hi I'm Caroline mili artiss and I'm going to show you how to make your very own laksa to start with we need to make a spice paste so we're doing this one from scratch now I'm gonna pop into my blender eight slots four cloves of garlic handful of macadamia nuts now I'm using macadamia nuts because I can't get hold of any candle nuts here but in Malaysia they would use handle nuts and macadamia nuts are the closest thing to it two stalks of lemongrass with the outer shell taken off now and I've got a piece of galangal which I've taken the skin off that's going in I've got about eight big red chillies so we need a lot of chilli in this but it's gonna go a long way two teaspoons of ground black pepper two teaspoons of ground coriander one teaspoon of turmeric one and a half teaspoons of shrimp paste now lets blend this up till it's a really fine paste in a large pan I'm gonna cook this spice paste in a bit of oil and we need this to cook for about ten minutes until it's turned a nice rich and darker deeper color and that's gonna allow all there all the flavours to infuse well together so give it a stir every now and then just to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom right now I can see the oils coming through the colors nice and darker it smells amazing I'm gonna add some brown sugar and salt and now I'm gonna pour in that a liter of water again we're gonna leave this now to simmer for about another 15 minutes if it boils down too much then you might want to add a bit more water just so that you've got plenty of super to eat I'm gonna add my coconut milk in now I'm also give that a stir around now now the time I'm gonna take the seasoning that needs a bit more salt definitely salt I'm gonna add a little touch more sugar so just adjust those to your liking and a pinch of white pepper that will be all the seasoning you want it to be a bit peppery now I'm going to strain this because it's got a lot of the mixture left in the sauce some people like to keep it in that's fine some people like to strain it out so do whatever whatever you fancy so I've got a large bowl here and a sieve I'm just gonna pour it all through the sieve so it catches all those little bits now I'm gonna pour the soup back into the pan let's bring that back up to the boil and I'm gonna add in my prawns they need to take a couple of minutes to cook so you put your pawns in right at the very end when you're ready to serve while you're waiting for your spice paste to cook just get together all the other ingredients you need now I've got some white rice noodles the very thin ones often called vermicelli so I've soaked those in some boiling water I have some cooked chicken breasts I just simply put mine on a tray in the oven with a little bit of oil and let that cook once it cooled I've just shredded it so that's going in I've made a plain basic omelet and finely sliced it I have a handful of bean sprouts and some finely chopped coriander and I have some finely chopped coriander and you can keep the stalks on because they taste good so those are the main ingredients for your laksa and the prawns are now cooked so we've assembled all those bits into a large bowl all you have to do now is pour the soup on top of all the ingredients get a good few prawns in there serve your bowl of laksa with a wedge of lime
