 times are tough at the moment we have to save money and we can't afford them luxury things like going over takeaway or cooking expensive and intricate meals so I thought I'd bring back an old classic one that you probably won't find to get a five-star hotel or at any fancy-schmancy dinner parties but trust me your family will love it it's shepherd's pie other one-putt chef okay shepherd's pie real easy to do first of all we've got some garlic infused olive oil in our pot which I've just nice and heated up to that we're going to add one small onion finely chopped I'm cheating I'm using sizzle sizzle sizzle I'm shooting and using rehydrated onion flakes but feel pretty is a fresh onion I just didn't have one today so let that sizzle up in the air and to that you're going to add 500 grams of beef mince or ground beef as you Americans will call it now purists will say this isn't shepherd's pie this is cottage pie because I'm using beef instead of land which is the traditional one but long story short is it's much cheaper to feed than it is to use lamb because it's about twice the price and I just don't think it has as much flavor so we're just going to brown this meat right I make is nice browned there as you can see all this not steamed so to that we're going to add one cup of beef stock that just helps to give it a bit more liquidity because basically what we're making a savory met some gravy in it and it comes out of it to dry there's a little bit of liquid in it so just a cup of beef stock will do you can use stock cubes or powdered stock or real stock if you've got whatever you like so to that I'm also going to add splash of Worcestershire sauce big splash and a good squirt of tomato sauce tomato ketchup few Americans whatever you like you can also use tomato paste if you want but I think tomato sauce is good it's got a bit of sugar to it so add slide swiftness give it a bit of a stir add a little bit of salt and pepper Oh get in there there we go if you could smell this at home the smells absolutely fantastic and we're also going to add a couple of teaspoons of gravy powder instant gravy powder that's just basically going to help us thicken this so got that lovely sort of meaty gravy to it we're just going to turn that down and let that simmer until it started to nice and thickened up and then we'll be able to transfer it to our dish there's our savoury mince it's all nice and finish there lovely chunky and gravy yum yum yum so I'm just going to put this into our baking dish really lovely this looks very good there we go and what you need to do is just Pat it down so it's nice and even and just allow that to sit on the side to cool for a while while we make our mashed potato right time to make our mashed potato now that's just a kilo of potatoes which I've peeled chopped and oiled now all I got to do is give a mash with the mash up you don't have to absolutely pulverize it just get the big lumps out we're just going to add some marjoram to that about a tablespoon nothing too crazy and just quickly mix it in wooden spoon for that I think easier smells yummy already mother part those ago they were interested I've got an audience at the moment the amazing misty is sitting in the background watching as I do this those of you or member mhistie from the Bailey's Irish Cream video whether she was official taste tester of the one pot chef show yes there we go now just to add a little bit of flavor to this because it's already got a lot of flavor but I'm going to add a little bit of Parmesan cheese now this is just that pregrated stuff that you put on you the stick getting all night doesn't have to be anything fancy than to grate anything for yourself just adds a little bit of extra to it there we go now we're ready to top our shepherd's pie I'm just going to put little globs onto the shepherd's pie there and we've topped our shepherd's pie with the mash now just grabbing a fork just going to be scoring the mashed potato on top what that this isn't just for decoration that this actually helps the potato to crisp up on top when you put it into the oven there's nothing better than that nice crispy potato top that's looking very good see a bit of the gradient poking through that's just makes it a bit extra tasty now let's just go straight into an oven 180 degrees for about 20 minutes until it's golden brown on top and serve with your favorite veggies and there we have our completed shepherd's pie fresh out of the oven hot steamy and delicious you can see that lovely gravy meat underneath and that fluffy yellow mashed potato nice and golden on top absolutely delicious I hope you've enjoyed this recipe if you've got any questions or comments feel free to email me at one pot chef at hotmail.com you can catch me on skype there's a link on the channel page and until next time see you later
