 hello guys this year from the gym Red Sox trying to come up another meter favorite dish for our customers is the initiative what is it pork loin or you can also do the field we go at it and then mix of tea in come along so that's what I'm going to do today so enjoy it and hopefully learn so first we're going to start with the pork loin what we have right here is already cleaned and cut it's actually not pork loin it is from the pork butt area but it's a very nice and tender and very tasty other than see me anyway if it's a very clean cutlet and tender meat at the park cutlet let's are we call you put that on plastic wrap like this and then you wrap it over on the other side like this and then you just like that don't have much too much you don't want to get an open it but you wanna make it nice and flat and around with signal for it maybe a quarter inch of the right and now you can leave it here and we start repairing the bread you're gonna need to look flour then we need the breading dry white bread preferable some kind of or rolls you can pretty much get anywhere needs to be white and then we're going to get a couple of eggs you probably need only one but we just gonna use to put it with it up put it in a larger container then the way we're going to start it is you're going to put it in flour first very lightly and then you're going to put it in the act like this and we're going to put it in the bread now what I like to do now I'd like to add a little salt to it and pepper what I need to get the little pepper I like black pepper and a lot of people like white pepper for it but I like the black pepper I like the flavor of it now we will put in the breading turn it around a little bit take a little of the breading and then very lightly press on press on the white bread crumbs just like that turn it around a couple of times always a little messy but that's how it works so now we got a knife schnitzel Braddock and now we're going to go over to the stove and cook it in kernel of it now now we're going to cook the schnitzel in canola oil and a nice large pan with roughly a quarter inch of canola oil needs to have a lot of worldly kind of deep-fried not really fried but not and try to deep-fried however you want to call it but that's probably the best way to do get it nice and hot nuts would but it needs to be nice mark so when you put it in need to stop bugging right away just like it does here and then so I'm we put into oil start bubbling and be sauteed roughly for one minute one minute on each side needs to get nice and brown and crispy and it started already right over here turn around i'm going to look at it and see that it looks nice the heat we eat we need to have a lot of heat obviously that's the commercial colvin Buster at home you know you can adjust the heat osv to make it nice and hard and now it's having a nice color golden brown several around one minute I get now we're going to turn it around lemon and then we are almost we are almost done maybe another 30 seconds and that we have power famously dismissal from the spices hammer restaurant in our leader so that's a perfectly cooked wienerschnitzel right there gold color night night in frisbee and what what I like to do the little oil I like to I like to just touch it up lightly but don't press it too much needs to be needs to stay night with you and you don't want to get rid of the braddock the way we serve said is we can service a lot of things we can serve it with spaetzle the German pasta mashed potatoes roasted potatoes french fries and a lot of different things we probably want to do that the next time we're going to make some German roasted potatoes but what we like to do with it what is really good is we serve it with a cup of lemon slices and there you go and that's how our Wiener schnitzel and what I like to do is eat it just like that here are me you
