as well as a bunch of basil of cauliflower 1 broccoli a small size a cane of mixed beans and then a nice big to cleaner chopped then pepper salt nice extra virgin olive oil in a beautiful piece of fresh Parmesan cheese then we need to use these tomato sauce you can find this everywhere in the world is the best tomato sauce in the world and my grandmother uses it and she said you have to use this one otherwise it doesn't turn the way patterns then we need to use some chopped to swell one one sweet potato chopped 1 vegetable cubed stock and you add our leader of Earth water this is a nice

loved one and make this very easy recipe that everyone will love especially in winter so let's put about 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil make sure you pre the pot on a medium heat and the pot needs to be nice and big now let's put the onion in the pot put the carrots and the salary and we do this we cook it for about three minutes on a medium heat and then we add a little bit of water let's put about off glass of water so we don't burn the onion now let's cut the chunk steak into small pieces we want to get a piece maybe about this big so that's what we're gonna do is Hey okay now we're gonna place the meat in the pot so now we cook it for about five minutes until the meat becomes nice and brown now let's chop the cauliflower into nice pieces you want the broccoli to be in almost the same size as the cauliflower my wife normally cuts the vegetables into the same pieces they all look the same unfortunately can't do that so I'm very sorry Suzanne I know you will get upset when you see this now it's time to place the finely chopped tomato in here this Mel is taking me back to Italy to my grandmother's kitchen oh yeah now let's stir it now it's time for us to place everything in the pot so we start from the cauliflower and the broccoli yeah beautiful now we place the zucchini then we want to place the sweet potato or here's a smell is nice even though it's windy and now we have the beans I will say chop some basil just with a hand like this now we place the stock so it gets familiar with a vegetable stir it well now we're gonna add about one and a half liters of water and make sure everything is covered if you need more water if you need two readers that's fine as long you cover everything now this is a must in my grandmother recipe and it's a must for me as well you should be able to find in any good Italian delicatessen the skin of the Parmesan cheese they should sell it for you now let's cut the skin into small pieces it's gonna be nice and hard so you need to press then we'll make cubed and another one now let's place these in there this will give extra flavors to the minestrone then we add some salt and pepper now we stir it gently properly when you make sure everything is is getting together and then what we're going to do we are going to cover it and cook it for at least two hours on our medium slow it and now basically we have two
