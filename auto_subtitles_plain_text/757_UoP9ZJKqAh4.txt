 Seraphim average Betty here and I'm making mashed potato pops okay skeptics I know what you're thinking mashed potatoes on a stick how do you do that the answer is simple magic is this your card let's make mashed potato pops I've got a bowl here and these are a couple of Idaho russets that I've peeled and cooked in the microwave just until tender this is butter and some salt you can cook the potatoes on the stovetop too just like you would if you were making mashed potatoes this crazy fun idea was developed by Erika of in Erika's kitchen there that looks about right I'm going to make two different kinds of pops so I'm dividing the mashed potatoes like so don't be shy this is pepper jack cheese bacon bits get this good and combined and if you haven't guessed yet this is going to be a jalapeno popper pop I know it's tempting to go crazy with the cheese and bacon but you need a good ratio so your pops stay together and there that's about the texture you want for my next trick I'm going ballpark style this is garlic powder dried parsley and this is finely grated Parmesan cheese mm-hmm now to shape them into balls here's my jalapeno popper pop mixture I've got a trusty tablespoon here and I'm filling it just to the top don't go crazy with a heaping tablespoon or your pop will be too big to fit in your piehole remember you shouldn't have to rely on magic to eat the Pops roll the mixture into a ball easy enough right continue doing this until you have all the mixture rolled into balls I'm going to do the same thing with the garlic parmesan mixture Idaho russets are really good for this because they have a lower moisture content so the mixture sticks together well as you finish rolling each ball place them on a baking sheet when you fill up a sheet you can pop them into the fridge for safekeeping and it helps to set them up this is where things get exciting here's an egg doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo and these are panko bread crumbs this is what you call a breading station place the mashed potato balls into the beat and get them good and coated transfer the coated mashed-potato ball into the breadcrumbs and roll around the potato ball not you and here's a garlic parmesan ball you can do it continue with this until all of your balls are coated now for the really fun and dangerous part where I saw myself in half okay just kidding but I'm sure the haters got excited about that this is a giant vat of hot oil people which can be almost as dangerous as sawing yourself in half so be careful I use a kitchen spider to drop the balls into the hot oil quick factoid I'm terrified of spiders but kitchen spiders not so much look at this golden-brown deliciousness directly onto a paper towel and just a sprinkle of salt and here's my first batch if you're wondering where the magic is pipe down Copperfield we're about to magically transform our mashed potato balls into mashed potato pops hocus-pocus alc√°zar turn these balls into pops and how good does that look abracadabra tato pops recipe at average Betty calm and even more potato pop recipes at in Erika's kitchen calm I hope you give these mashed potato pops a try after all they're as much fun as you can put on a stick without resorting to witchcraft find me on Facebook and Twitter and drop by my home at average Betty calm thanks for watching and subscribing see you next time
