 welcome to the poor man's gourmet kitchen where we share gourmet recipes add a little bunch of wonder check this alright today we're going to be doing Chris bean burritos as you can see I've got a sizable tortilla right here from me it's pretty big pretty doughy it's got a real good consistency to us you can roll it won't crack or or fail on you when you wrap up any kind of burrito but we're going to keep it simple like I said Chris bean burritos what we're doing here I've already got the refried beans now believe it or not the best way to do this is to pick up yourself a bag of these okay they are dehydrated refried beans and the secret to these that most people won't tell you other it following the regular directions it's a start with some bacon fat in the bottom of your pan then follow the rest of the directions okay the very end through it some scallions stir it up like this as you can see in there a little green scallion pieces in there and then you're good to go now what you can do is take these tortillas cut them just like this cut them in fours don't have to be perfect and then what you're going to do is after the beans have cooled down enough to where they're thick because you don't want to run it off here your play you don't want them in the fryer bleeding out everywhere so you're going to put just a little amount right there like that and you're going to smear it on the inside and you're going to keep to one of these edges here keep away from this edge here and then all you got to do roll it to admit I stab it in and I come back out okay and that's that that's all you got to do I'm going to knock out a bunch more of these and we'll take it to the fryer now here's the easy part get your fryer up to 375 and drop these things right in there we don't just take a couple minutes for those to get the killer we'll pull them out okay they're good to go just clip that dryer up like so let it drip-dry give it a few minutes and we'll take it to some paper towel and serve it up there you go now very simply just pull the toothpick out how hard is that crispy and burritos right here in the poor man's gourmet kitchen
