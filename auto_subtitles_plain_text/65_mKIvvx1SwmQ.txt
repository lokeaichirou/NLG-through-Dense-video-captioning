 hey everybody this is to take out diet also known as where diets go to die and today on the show we'll be making our version of the Taco Bell bean burrito now let me tell you I have never willingly ordered a Taco Bell bean burrito it is so mushy and textualist that it just doesn't do it for me but you can end up with the bean burrito two ways you're horribly broke and you have to order it off of the value menu or you're horribly drunk you mumble inaudible words to your sober driver of course and then they say she'll have a bean burrito and even in your drunkenness state you're like no I said why didn't we go to Chipotle and it's because Chipotle isn't open it three four five maybe six in the morning don't judge anyway today we're going to make it because it is fibrous and maybe I need to poop you know who knows just saying let's get started start by starting your big pot of cooked pinto beans because I am NOT showing you how to make that next we're going to steam our flour tortilla in the microwave for 30 seconds if you have whole-wheat flour tortillas perfect if you have a steamer that's even better but going to cover my flour tortilla and wet paper towels and microwave it for 30 seconds place it on a large plate and then pour on your serving of pinto beans then taco bell says they use a tangy red sauce what the heck is a tengu red sauce I asked my sister and she's like it's that sour sweet Tinky red stuff at the Asian restaurant and I'm like no no no no it's not that I am pretty sure it's not that but I still don't know what it is so we are going to add on a little bit of ketchup and a little bit of sriracha sauce together and hope for the best lastly we're going to add on our onions in our cheddar I use diet cheddar cheese and honestly I only use a little bit because it tastes funny now how do you wrap up a burrito you may ask are I you know whatever take the side of the tortilla closest to you and fold it over the stuff in the middle tuck that in under the stuff and then fold in both sides you can fold them in straight if you're amateur but I fall mining at a triangular angle and then do another fold and then roll it the rest of the way towards the other side opposite of you now we can eat it despite my preconceived notions it actually tastes good I thought I would take one bite and just start to involuntarily gag but I'd merely took a second bite it was really good the diet cheese was pretty good the beans were cooked really well and then I ran into the sriracha sauce now I don't eat hot stuff that often and I'll put on a little bit of a lot of sriracha sauce so it is hot it is hot so I would add less next time that's how you learn life lessons you know you do something you feel pain you don't do it the next time but overall it was really good no harsh words about the bean burrito for me I like pinto beans I just wish I had a little bit more crunch and a little bit more crisp so that is it for today I would like to thank you for watching my bean burrito episode please leave your thoughts in fast-food drive-through dining dining out take out suggestions in the comments below and I will read and respond to all of them and please subscribe if you haven't subscribed you don't want to miss out so do that and I will see you tomorrow bye I would like to introduce you all to my dog his name is Buster he's a Pembroke Welsh Corgi he's wondering why I'm talking like this he's very hopeful that he will get my bean burrito um he is four years old he's a boy and he is adorable and he's fat he doesn't eat people food what we give him like carrots and things but mainly he just eats dog food but still he's managed to put on a lot of weight see see his stomach he said
