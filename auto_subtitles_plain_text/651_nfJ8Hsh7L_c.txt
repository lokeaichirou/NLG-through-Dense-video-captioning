 shepherd's pie my favorite dinner every year grew up birthdays Christmas don't want talking about shepherd's pie I make this back once a week I always make it in bulk because it's really easy to make em really easy to store migrate zip out after work or off to school I only had a long day you know any fancy cooking so what I'm gonna do is take you over to the stove gas on I put a splash of olive oil in there so what fried onions I use them quite a lot they are ready chopped ready for slow-cooked and I will really do my lights of Top Chef you look at ingredients it's literally onions olive oil and that is it so I think you feel quite don't bite in using them some people find it hard to cope if buying attentive onions or buying a packet ready-prepared onions is gonna make you help you cook something home-cooked then as well yeah just do it don't feel guilty about it it's lovely nice organic lamb mince and this is just going into Brown it deep clump it and once that's it's all browned we'll put the stock in and anything slow-cooked it tastes amazing all right much better cuz the flavors infuse notes with mince I don't know sometimes you get mince and it's not properly cooked just complain it'll clump together it's really horrible yeah this way there's no danger back to salt just melt it down it's just delicious so that's all nicely browned now say nicely it doesn't actually fit nicely later now the liquid I've got some beef stock here I'm just gonna pour that all in I've got 800 grams of meat here and about 800 milliliters of stock and I'm going to pour a bit of tomato sauce in splash of Liam pairings YUM was just your sauce brings everything to life yeah I'm not gonna put you assaulted at this stage and right later lots of pepper if it's not it's quite salty that's why into the oven here you open it for me yeah make sure the shelves are already done just put it into it over the tops haven't got a lid big enough and check it after about three hours so my shepherd's pie meat sauce has been bubbling away in the oven for about four hours I just checked this really reduce done nicely it looks absolutely lovely it's ready to come out but some time in to get a bit of flavor and some small salt and pepper when I check how it's cooking whether it need that's just going the bottom normally what I would do is have a mass on top of this and then rich it up and grated cheese on top YUM but today I am going to use some cauliflower cheese which is a kind of really different way of doing it but really nice and really tasty all the flavors work really well together and it also means you've got your vegetables in your main dish as well so you don't have to do anything else on the side so in here I've made if you felt it last week to make cauliflower cheese I'm literally gonna just put that on top and then are you gonna put crumbs and Parmesan cheese on top and one of the nice things about this is because it's quite a textured top here we bake it in the oven Google print goes really crunchy so I think that's probably just a perfect amount I'm gonna bake it just this small dish probably about half an hour until it's bubbling on top and heat it all the way through so I did what we gonna name this cauliflower shepherd's you want a flower shepherds college leopards collie surely yeah it does anyway it's really really good really unusual twist on a classic cauliflower cheese on a shepherd's pie bottom beautiful try it let us know what you think see ya bye bye we're sisters and together we're crumbs we both like cooking and dog food and chocolate and red wine
