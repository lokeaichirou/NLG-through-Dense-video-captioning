 hey everybody today I'm gonna show you how to make some super crispy fried chicken southern style first thing you want to do is what I'm using here is some wings and some thigh and leg quarters okay all you do is get you knife chopping babies up real good here don't cut yourself and ever want a seasonal salt pepper garlic powder is what I use and then I tossed them real good in the bow my hand just tossed the bowl up and down and then I do the other side exactly the same way okay now once I get that done I'm going to put in two cups of regular Greek yogurt you might think what yeah they've been doing this for years regular Greek yogurt rubber down in there get it all mixed in there the best you can and when you got it in there I want you to fill the rest of the hot up with whole milk okay just regular whole milk you don't have to have buttermilk or know that stuff and we're gonna go just like I did with my fish if you saw that video we're gonna go in the refrigerator for six hours I mean you got the time do it in the morning let it sit its tenderizing it it's making all those flavors get in there it's gonna make it so crunchy and delicious okay there's what it looks like six hours later all right now once you get out I don't knock anything off I just kind of move it around make sure everything got good and soaked and then I go over here and I throw me about two or three cups of regular all-purpose flour and a pan or a bowl as you can see and there's one whole tablespoon of sea salt and one whole tablespoon of garlic powder and a bunch of black pepper now you can put as much of that on there as you want to and I also add cayenne okay now you can add more Cayenne right there for a more spicier chicken this is pretty mild kids can eat it you know what I'm saying like this so you want to stir it all up really really good there and make sure take the time to get in there and completely mix it because that is the taste that your chicken is gonna tap when you bite into the crust and now I come straight out of the yogurt and go straight into the flour mixture and I don't do a lot of shaking off or nothing I just kind of move it like that let's set it on the side over there and I'll get another piece here and show you just like so that's one of the wings without a leg on it there I mean without that little flap that's totally useless I'm gonna do it for you okay and I think I got me a leg here coming up next oh yeah where are your leg there it is okay now do my leg okay now once you get all your pieces coded you've got to have hot oil y'all don't go in with no cold oil it's got to be 375 degrees all right now once you know it's 375 degrees I want you to take your chicken and be careful and put it in the oil okay just like so and when you get about half of that amount of chicken that I was cooking there in your pot don't touch it don't touch it until it starts to get a nice color to it you know I'm saying I mean it needs to be some brownness that you can see okay like that see it's starting to turn brown now once you reach in there and just kind of touch them around a little bit don't do anything major and what you're trying to do at this point is make sure that none of your pieces of chicken are stuck together okay and this is this is getting brown or in brown as you can see and remember this is i fast-forwarded this so you don't see all the cooking and when it gets to be that color that's where I like mine right there that color I take it out this time serve it up folks okay I take it what I do is I take it from there and put it on a paper towel on the plate drain it and then serve it there you go everybody there it is my juicy crispy southern fried chicken recipe oh yeah baby now this is a very crispy recipe okay you might go wow that is crispy well it is it's very crispy y'all I want you just look how juicy and delicious this looks and it was delicious oh you have me there y'all give this a try if you would and give me any likes and subscribes and pass it on to your best friend the autumn unnie and I really truly hope you guys have an awesome awesome day for sure it's springtime in Texas I'm hoping but you never know about Texas by
