 g'day guys we have one of my absolute favorites here today you will need some schnitzels now that's a nice veal schnitzels here sometimes made with yearling stencils but it should be veal some flour a couple of beaten eggs some breadcrumbs and some salt and pepper now I'm going to start by just seasoning the flour with the salt and pepper and give it a mix and get that veal schnitzel and just coat it lightly in flour then dip it in the egg and then coat it well with breadcrumbs and that's all you need to do for this step guys so just repeat this for all of your schnitzels and then set them to one side and we'll get started on the potato pancake so here I've got a large potato and half an onion which I've grated and squeezed out all of the excess moisture you really need to get this as dry as possible a couple of teaspoons of flour and egg yolk and some salt and pepper now this is very easy just throw in all these ingredients seasoned well and then mix it all together now I've got a couple of barbecue plates here heat it to a medium heat so I'm just going to start by putting a bit of oil on one of them and also melting some butter onto it and we're going to get that potato pancake and flatten it out and we're going to give this about a 5-minute head start over the schnitzels because it will take longer to cook now you want to make sure you keep a medium heat here or else it will burn so after about five minutes I'm just going to turn over that potato pancake and it is looking fantastic cook for another couple of minutes and then add some oil and some butter to the other plate then just put on the schnitzels and you only need to cook these for about a minute to two minutes per side now you want to take care turning them you don't to break up those bread crumbs and they are looking absolutely fantastic or not belong there so once they're done simply take them out onto some paper towel to drain off the excess oil plate up and then squeeze on a bit of lemon juice and you are done guys now this is absolutely awesome in my opinion far better than chicken sniffles so check it out thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time
