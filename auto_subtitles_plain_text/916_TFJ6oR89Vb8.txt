 hello this is chef john from food whooshes comm with cherry tomato feta in basil scrambled eggs when i think summer i think sweet corn on the cob I think how's it possible the Chicago Cubs suck again this year and I think delicious sweet cherry tomatoes so I'm gonna show you how to make one of my favorite summer breakfasts and one of the keys is Me's applause we got to have all these ingredients ready chopped sliced ahead of time before we start cooking because this thing cooks so fast there's just no time to do anything once the flame is out okay first of all we have three farm-fresh eggs and by farm-fresh I mean just from the grocery store three cherry tomatoes per egg I have nine cherry tomatoes cut in half some Shifa nod of fresh sweet basil some hot pepper and feta one of my favorite cheese's I'm gonna give a nice pinch of red pepper flakes to the eggs give those a scramble and then we're gonna dump in the other ingredients there's just no time to add those once the eggs are in the pan the feta cheese the sweet fresh basil and our lovely sweet 100 cherry tomatoes I'm gonna throw a heavy high-quality nonstick pan on high heat that's right high don't be afraid a nice glug of olive oil about a tablespoon and a half maybe all right leave it on the heat until it starts to shimmer that means it's really hot so that's smoking yet but it's shimmering and then dump in the eggs have your spatula in your hand and don't do anything for five seconds don't do anything wait for it wait for it and now start moving the pan moving the eggs moving everything and this is gonna cook this is real time however my second sis is this is gonna cook really fast normally I use a lower heat for scrambled eggs but the idea here is because we have such watery ingredients the cherry tomatoes and the feta we need to cook everything fast before everything starts to bleed okay so that's it how simple all right transfer to a plate I'm gonna top with some fresh sea salt the feta has a little bit of salt in it but you're gonna need a little more probably so incredibly delicious sweet herbaceous little bit salty just magnificent and oh yeah there will be blood and by blood I mean delicious sweet cherry tomato juice and a little bit of feta milk the genius of this dish though is the toast soaks it up and you're in summer breakfast heaven and cherry tomatoes are just perfect right now for this dish so go get some give it a try go to the site all the ingredients are there although I don't really think you need them and as always enjoy
