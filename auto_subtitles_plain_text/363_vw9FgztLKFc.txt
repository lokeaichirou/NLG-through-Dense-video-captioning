 hi I'm Erin and today I'm going to be making one of my favorite pub foods escargot stuffed and mushroom caps it is a simple and easy meal to make and it's delicious it's actually more of an appetizer than a meal but it's definitely if you have it with some bread or some bruschetta that it will be a delicious meal so I've already started to preheat my pan and preheat my oven so I'm going to add a splash of Spanish olive oil to the bottom of my pan just kind of swirl it around that we're going to add half of a sweet onion so the quarter cup diced and I'm going to start with a tablespoon a dozen mushroom caps I'm not going to let it cook too long I just want to set it for a minute and then what I'm going to do is I have some dry red wine this is a cab I'm going to add right a cup and a half of red wine into my pan now I put the dry because I don't want this sweet flavor take them away from the dish this is some fresh thyme I'm adding in and then I have a dozen dry precooked Helix s cargos so I'm going to add those in right away also okay so I'm gonna get a mushroom spread out around the outside of the pan I'm gonna turn up the heat on the pan because I'm really going to let that red wine cook down and get some concentrated flavor into it this is gonna take about four minutes and by the time it's done the mushrooms will be cooked the escargot will be hot the flavor of the time will be infused into the red wine so we'll come back in four minutes when this is all finished and ready to go on to the next step alright so took six minutes so far and the the sauce has been completely reduced so we're just left with some cooked mushrooms and the large helix snails garlic and onions so I'm gonna turn that right down just keep cooking the sauce a little bit I have some Muslim dishes so I'm going to start by loading the mushrooms into the mushroom dishes at 6:00 each so try to choose mushrooms that are appropriate size for the snails that you have know that not everyone has mushroom dishes you could use a little plate instead and now I've put the snails on top of the mushrooms now I'm just gonna do the same for the other mushroom dish it's like I said I had 12 mushrooms and 12 snails so load those in there the aroma coming off of this is fantastic this is a really great meal for one of those cool fall days okay so I'm gonna the rest of the sauce with the garlic's and the onions I'm going to just kind of pour on top of that you want some sauce in there just pull off the time and put off to the side okay the mushrooms and the snake all in there I have some pre grated mozzarella cheese put just a little bit of feta in there just gonna want that extra little pop of flavor from the dryness of the feta cheese and it adds a little bit of contrast to your mozzarella cheese which is really mild I did not very much but just a very little bit now I just talked to enough of it to cover the mushrooms and the snails and I have them in dishes so when the melts it doesn't get all over the oven so I'm going to put this in my preheated oven that is at 425 degrees it's going to take around 15 minutes in this up all right we will check back in 15 minutes and we'll see what they're looking like okay so it's been 15 minutes the escargot is completely done now the sauce is nice and bubbly watch the cheese is all nice and melty and crisp on the top and I've also made some a little bit of garlic toast with some focaccia bread that I made earlier today so that's it it took about 25 minutes to make it total it's pretty easy process and it's very good on a nice crisp fall day thank you for watching and if you enjoyed my videos please subscribe
