 today we're going to be making corn dogs some people call them logos like in Canada some people call them batter francs here are the ingredients that we're going to need 1 cup of flour one and a half teaspoons of baking powder a half a teaspoon of salt four tablespoons of cornmeal three tablespoons of oil 1 egg and three quarters of a cup of milk so let's get started the first thing that we want to do here is crack our egg open and then we're going to grab ourselves a bowl and get our milk in there and then pop your egg in and get that all nicely whisked together alright let's get the rest of the ingredients in let's get the salt in and all of our flour and get that nicely incorporated next we'll pop in the oil mix that in nicely and then our baking powder and our last ingredient we'll put in is the cornmeal and I like to let this batter sit for about good 10 minutes so that the baking powder starts to activate in the batter okay so you want your oil between 360 and 375 degrees also always make sure that the handle of your pot is pointing towards the wall you don't want to have any accidents all right so we've got our hot dogs all ready to go we've got our batter and we've got somewhere to actually drain the corn dogs when they're ready so all I've done is basically taking hot dogs and I've cut them in half and I've put little sticks into the one end of the hot dog so we're going to grab our hot dog and we're going to dip it into the batter and you really want to get all of the hot dog totally covered in the batter and then gently place it into the oil and what I try to do is kind of hold it so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the pot just for a couple of seconds and what that does is it creates a little coating on the corn dog and then it doesn't stick to the bottom so you can see me doing that here and then finally drop it there we go let's do it again into the batter twist it around try to get the batter all over and then gently put it into the oil always remember to gently place things in oil you don't want you don't want to drop it in quickly because it'll splash up on you let's try it again here we go and then let go so these corn dogs are almost ready to come out I'm looking for a nice golden brown color I never actually time how long they're in there I look at the color and when the color is really nice and golden brown then I take them out and now I'm just going to drain them so let's drain them and now let's start the process again now I've zoomed the camera in a little bit and change the angle so that we can actually see closer what I'm actually doing here so I'm right now I'm dipping it into the oil so here's a close-up of me coding the corndog and then I put it into the oil I'm just showing you different angles of all of the process alright so here's our second batch and they're ready to go so let's get them out and drain them and here we have our final product yummy corn dogs you can serve them up with mustard like I have here or you can also eat them with ketchup kids seem to love ketchup I love mustard but any which way you like it that's the way to go don't worry about the hotdog being thoroughly cooked when it's in the fryer that long and when it gets golden brown like this on the outside the hotdog is fully cooked on the inside so don't worry about that at all anyway try out this recipe and let me know how it turned out so that's it for this video so I'll see you next time you
