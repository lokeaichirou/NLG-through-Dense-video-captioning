 so the first thing I've done for the kauffman sure is I've buttered the bread with some butter toasted it until it's golden brown on one side so what I'm gonna do next I'm gonna flip it over and they add a little bit of mustard smear it just over the bread I'm using or be a quality assured precooked sliced ham and of course you can cook your own ham this is lovely it's delicious very convenient and this is what I love about a sandwich like this it's so tasty we would make this regularly in the restaurant two slices of the ham and then lots of the cheese sprinkle it all over so the cheese is just a nice mature cheddar cheese and it's just pregrated now this needs to go back onto the griddle to melt and this just takes a minute have your grill unfold so while it's on its gonna talk to you about what I'm gonna put on the very top of the be sure and it's a bechamel and the ingredients in the bechamel are very very easy probably the first sauces I ever made as a chef so you have equal quantities of butter and flour would you do is cook them out you make a roux and then you add in some milk am using full fat milk Innis and then the last thing I put in is a little bit of nutmeg so I works really well in the sandwich cook it all together until it becomes nice and thick and you keep whisking it so there's no lumps and this can be done ahead I put a little bit of cheese into this also so again it enriches it and it's delicious also with this a very simple salad so this is just some grated carrot some fresh carrot so it's full of goodness which is already pre grated and you can see I've used the course end of the grater so peel your carrots create them a little bit of beetroot now I'm using some raw beetroot or you can use some cooked beetroot in this doesn't really matter so this goes into our dish and also some red onion so slice the red onion everything goes in here this gives a lovely interest in texture but also vinegar kind of like a sharp taste and this what I have here is some gherkin couldn't to lit the strip's so a lovely little pickle a little bit of gherkin goes in there and I love radish and wood radishes thinly sliced like this you know you can have this done again just place this in gonna mix this all together with some toasted sesame seeds and then I have a small little dress in mid and in the dressing I have some olive oil with a squeeze of lemon juice and some salt and pepper don't overdress it just a couple of spoonfuls of this we put a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper into this and then just mix this really well just go right down to the bottom so that's that ready to go lovely and colorful remember you eat with your eyes but it's all about the taste so I just kind of check in the sandwich it should be ready the next layer is to go on and then the bechamel sauce now so after a couple of minutes the cheese is lovely golden brown nice and bubbly so now define the stage is that piece that I took off the tray so I wanted to catch it's buttered and toasted that goes on top and then our bechamel so a couple of spoons of this smear it down doesn't matter who falls down the side it's the whole idea just delicious I don't ill actually protect the top of the bread that's gonna take a minute or two let's golden brown and it's gonna be ready to be served so after a minute or two on to the grill it's beautiful and golden brown smells delicious just be careful it's extremely hot using a fish nice just lift it off and the cheese will catch don't worry about that I'm just gonna cut it in wedges you can just pull one there and one kind of resting just on top like that and then we got to serve our salad one last mix and then plenty of this here big pile of this and I love serving something on wood it looks really good so pilot nice and high with the salad and that I think is just a real family favors has to cook me sure with the carrot and beetroot salad and remember always choose food with the board be equality mark so that you know where your food comes from and that has been produced to the highest or beer quality standards
