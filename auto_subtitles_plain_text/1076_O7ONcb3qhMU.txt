 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm so excited to bring you my recipe for onion rings now everyone knows on your rings and it's been requested almost on every single video especially all my mozzarella sticks video everybody was like gray lamb macho sticks now onion rings onion rings anyways onion rings onion rings up everyone loves them there's so many different ways of making them and I myself make them a few different ways I drew like a bread crumb coating a beer-battered or this is more about a classic battered on your rings that's what I'm showing you today it's so easy simple to put together the ingredients for them or very few you'll just need some all-purpose flour hot sauce of your choice buttermilk you'll need some granulated onion garlic dried parsley paprika baking powder celery salt an egg a bit more salt and pepper your onion and some vegetable oil and the ovens preheated for a different recipe so you don't have to stick around to see what that is now in here I've got some pan oil and you can use peanut or you can use vegetable oil canola oil any light colored oil that can come up to high temperature without smoking a lot so you wouldn't want to use olive oil for this because it will be smoking up the house and it turns brown and bitter very quickly so any light colored oil will do I'm using peanut oil today because in a little bit I plan on making some fried chicken and I have to have my fried chicken fried a pan oil just I am go the onion is just a big delicious sweet yellow onion and what I'm going to do to this is I'm just going to take off the very first layer cut the bottom and cut the top take off the very first layer maybe even two depending if you really need to like I'm gonna take off this layer as well it's got a lot of brown on it it's pretty thin I'm just gonna cut this into a pieces like that and now you can you know up to you if you want them really thick you can cut them really thick if you want them really thin you can cut them thinner doesn't really matter it really sometimes just depends on my mood sometimes I've got really thick sometimes I go thin just going to separate them and just going to put this on my plate so we're gonna be so good I'm so excited you know a lot of people ask oh can you show us some healthier recipes healthier recipes but I think what most people forget is that to upload a new recipe every other day you got to do a little bit of everything and I want to please my audience and everyone asks for Fried Chicken and onion rings and french fries and I want to show those recipes to you insure them with you but I'm certainly not advertising that you eat them every day in fact it's it's been a very long time since I've made homemade onion rings - because fried food around here is a treat we definitely don't order when we're out we don't order fried food on a regular basis and I prefer to make things at home as you all know so you know I'm feeling up to it I make some fried chicken nothing wrong with that moderation lots of exercise works wonders all right this is fine I'm going to save these to make a sauce otherwise I'm be a little bit much I think going on our batter we got my all-purpose flour here and I've got some butter milk and buttermilk it's the key for a really delicious light and fluffy batter and including um and also the baking powder is really important as well and as far as spices the world is your pickle I mean if you like certain spices as those I mean I love that combination so that's what I use a good pinch of salt is really important and that's a freshly cracked black black pepper you could use white pepper here as well in a little bit of hot sauce I love sriracha so that's what I'm using you could use Tabasco you can use any kind of hot sauce you want it so now I'm just going to mix this up until it's pretty lump free so give it a good minute that looks great really nice and smooth now I've got my oil up to temperature I can kind of already gauge what the temperature should be I'm gonna add an onion in there if it's got color right away and if it you know if it's bubbling up right away and then it's good if you're using a thermometer you want this to be about 375 so this is all this is what I'm going to do with then dip my onion ring in my batter that's what you're looking for and I'm just going to continue to do this and then cook them for just a couple of minutes one until they develop a good golden brown color and then I've got a baking pan here just with some paper towels on it because I want to put the cooked on your rings on that to drain any excess oil and do it in batches because you don't want to overcrowd the pan otherwise it's going to defeat the purpose of being nice and crispy because you'll drop the temperature of the oil and they'll get really soggy so be patient my friend taking the last two off Oh ah I know I know it's killing me too because I know I can't eat the whole thing look at them ah got this one actually I want this one the little tiny ones like this are my favorite mm-hmm okay fine I'm gonna go in for one more personally I don't like on your rings dipped in anything my husband would probably choose a ketchup let me know what your favorite thing is to dip onion rings in but that's it they're very simple and easy to put together head on over to Laura in the kitchen I come and get the recipe as always I hope you enjoy spending time with me because I've certainly enjoyed spending time with you I see you next time bye bye you
