 I write a chef book here today we're cooking up a big-ass pan of burritos you know they look fantastic it tastes awesome and one of the reasons is because we're putting some roasted peppers in we got two poblano peppers and one green bell pepper you know we took out the ribs and the seeds you know slice them in half then we grease the pan and put the peppers cut side down and then bake them at 400 degrees for about a half an hour you know on roasting the peppers like this here it's gonna make the outside dark and a little bubbly and then when you pull it out of the oven while they're still hot cover them up and let them steam in their own heat for about 10 or 15 minutes this is gonna loosen up the skin and it'll peel right off you know when you want to peel it off cuz it's kind of plastic but what you're going to be left with is these awesome roasted peppers taste fantastic and you can use them in any kind of recipe but they're great with a burrito filling you know so just dice them up and then we'll get to work on the rest of this filling we're using a little bit of ground beef we're gonna go ahead and brown it up in a skillet if you don't want to use beef you know just use a lot of beans but we like the taste of the ground beef with the onion and garlic a lot of onion a lot of garlic you know throw it in here while this this meats brown enough and then we're gonna add some beans as well we're using one can of kidney beans and then one can of dog food if you don't want to use dog food then just use some refried beans you know basically the same thing now we're throwing in most of our roasted peppers we're gonna reserve about a 1/4 of it you know to use as a topping later and then we're getting off the heat throwing in our seasoning some chili powder cumin salt and pepper mixing it up and then that's our filling we can go ahead and roll it up and some tortillas now so we're greasing our pan you know that we're gonna put our burritos in and then we're gonna over stuff them you know camera girl always puts two heaping spoonfuls on here you know tops it with a little bit of cheese and then rolls it up you know she makes it look easy but it's not easy it's you know you get the skill and you're gonna learn it by practicing you know let's take another look see boom then boom that roll roll roll and then boom in the pan right it's not gonna fit you thinking but look amazing it fit you know she always Jam packs it fool because we like a lot of burritos and then she's got some leftover filling she's gonna go ahead and spread a little bit of that on top you know she's gonna put some salsa this is homemade sauce so you don't have to use homemade sauce so you can use like a jarred salsa if you're a caveman you know then the rest of our roasted peppers and a little more cheese you want to make the top look like a Mexican Christmas tree right and now we'll take the whole pan of burritos slide it in the oven still at 400 degrees let it bake away for about 30 or 40 minutes you know what you're looking for is for the edges just start to brown up once they start to brown around the edges go ahead and turn your oven to broil and then broil it for about three or four or five minutes something like that but watch it like a hawk because you don't want to burn the top you just want to toast it you know get a nice toasty cheese topping on there and then there you have it man boom fantastical burritos we're serving it up with some sour cream and some salad and homemade guacamole gg's burrito recipe go ahead and give this a try let me know what you think I'm beginning 2nd down so go ahead and give this recipe a try you know if you want to print it up go to my food channel calm you know this is probably more work than drew Network wants to put into his burritos but give it a go man [Music]
