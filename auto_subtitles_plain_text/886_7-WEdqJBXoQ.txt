 hi everyone I'm rockin Robin from cooking Mexican recipes calm now today I'm going to show you how to make some oven fried chicken we're going to season this with some bread crumbs with some Italian seasonings in that and I'll tell you it's just a little bit healthier than your typical pan-fried chicken so and the cleanup is so much easier you don't have all that grease splatter all over your stove and you don't have to worry about getting rid of all that extra oil that you've used to cook the chicken in so don't go away I'll be right back to tell you all about it so let me go over the ingredients with you so we can get started with our oven fried chicken so for our chicken I'm going to be using chicken thighs now I have four of them here and obviously the bone is in and I had the skin on and I left the skin on this one piece here so that I could show you my little tip for easily removing the skin off the chicken so basically what you want to do is I just grab a paper towel and I loosen the skin up and then I use the paper towel to pull back on the skin and I tell you it's a vice grip that just really makes it easy it just pulls it right off you have a nice grip on it so that works beautifully to do it that way okay so our other ingredients are our coating here I've got an egg which I'm going to beat up in a minute and my seasoned breadcrumbs now these are Italian seasoned breadcrumbs which means they have some spices in them already and I really like this I bought this at Whole Foods it's the 365 brand so if you want to try that you can if you don't have seasoned breadcrumbs or you have a hard time finding it I'm going to leave a little recipe for you in the description below this video so you can do your own if you like and we'll also need a little bit of flour that's about a quarter of a cup and the ratio to the breadcrumbs that's about a cup and then the other item that you'll need is some real butter this is organic butter I had one of my fans or my my viewers to my channel asked me to state when I use organic ingredients so there you go and we'll probably add just a little more salt and a little bit of pepper and that's all we'll need want to mention that you want to be preheating your oven right now - you know 425 degrees all right so what I'm going to do on this plate here is I'm just going to combine my seasoned bread crumbs with the flour so we'll sprinkle that on top and then blend it up really well now you'll take your egg and just beat that before so now all we do is you take a thigh I'm going to dip it right into the egg mixture just to give it a little coating so that the bread mixture will stick to it really well late in your crumbs and I like to take a spoon and just sort of sprinkle the crumbs over the chicken it just makes a little bit easier and just toss it around until it's all covered shake off any excess and then just lay it on your baking sheet now I'm using a pampered chef it's like a clay baking sheet and I like to use that it's not Teflon and it works beautifully so I'm going to go ahead and continue coating the rest of my chicken and we'll go from there so with the amount of breadcrumbs and even the egg that I had left over you can easily make six even eight pieces of chicken so I just wanted to show you that all I wanted for today for myself is four so that's why I have some leftover breadcrumbs so yeah and you can use certainly use chicken breasts legs thighs whatever you want to do as well so now all we have left to do is if you want to add just a little bit more salt just to give it a little sprinkle on top of each piece just a little bit and maybe a little pepper that's that and our last thing is butter so I had my butter in the refrigerator so it's nice and cold I'm peeling off a nice thin piece of butter can you see that can you see how thin that is I'll show you that in just a second here but you have to have your butter nice and cold in order to be able to do that okay so what I do is I take my knife and I go across the top and I make a very thin sliver of butter and hopefully you can see that it's just like paper paper-thin and then I place that on top of the chicken so I'm not adding too much butter but just a nice thin very thin paper layer I'm kind of good at this and everybody makes fun of me but because I do that to the butter sometimes I go across the top and then I've got this big you know valley in the butter and they're like what you do to the butter it's just me shaving off thin pieces when I want it really nice and thin but like I said it's got to be cold to do that so I just put a few pieces on top and show you that here in just a second just so you know you got some moisture because I took the skin off of the chicken and there's no fat up there so you've got to put a little bit of fat to get those breadcrumbs moistened and this butter will drip down and get on the bottom as well and then the bottom will also get nice and brown so here's the chicken here you can see where I placed the very thin slices of butter on top and that's pretty much it so we're going to place this in the oven a number I told you it's a set at 425 so we'll go do that now and we're going to check it in about 15 minutes it'll probably take you know half an hour total we'll put it in for 15 we'll turn it over and then we'll do it another 15 okay so you can see here I'm going to place this in the oven and I have it on the lower third of the rack not the very bottom rack but just one up above that so like I said we'll check that in 15 minutes all right here we go we're going to check the chicken time to turn it over starting to turn a nice golden-brown okay there we go and we're going to let that go for another probably 18 minutes I'm going to go all right so here's our chicken after about 35 minutes it's a beautiful golden brown and I'm just going to go ahead and cut into it you can use an instant-read thermometer that's got a little pink in it still I'm going to let it go probably one more minute or so that one looks done let that go one minute and then we're going to pull it out okay so here's our chicken just out of the oven doesn't that look fantastic nice and golden brown it's easy it's delicious cooks up within about a half an hour depending on how big your pieces are and you know you can serve this up with any kind of side dish salad vegetables and you've got a delicious meal that is healthier than regular fried chicken so yeah I get you got to give this a try so do try my oven fried chicken I know you're going to really enjoy it it's easy to cook it's easy to cleanup you don't have all that extra oil that you have to dispose of so yeah give it a try I'm really sure you're going to love this so go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you like this video and you want to see more of them and leave me a comment I'd love to hear how you cook your oven fried chicken maybe you have a special technique or recipe that you like to share alright thanks for watching and be sure and head on over to my website at cooking Mexican recipes com I have a lot of Mexican recipes over there that you can cook at home thanks for watching
