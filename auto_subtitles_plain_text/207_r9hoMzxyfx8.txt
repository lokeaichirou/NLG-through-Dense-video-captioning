 hey guys Richard Blaine here mr. easy cooking thanks for stopping by my easy Cooking Channel tonight um I'm sure many of you my subs and viewers know that I have a major-league penchant for Asian food and tonight I'm going to make some more Asian food I've been taking requests for a long long time and this last week I got a request from a viewer in Vietnam that said make Vietnamese style kimchi and I was like ok Vietnamese style kimchi that's a new one on me but come to do some research and yes the Vietnamese in Southeast Asia have their own version of kimchi not quite what the Koreans do with kimchi but just as lovely just as vibrant just as tasty as spicy as any kimchi that you could get out of Korea the ingredients are about the same you guys always hear me say that the reason I love Asian food is because Asian foods aren't interchangeable and they are and so tonight what I'm going to make for you is Vietnamese style kimchi this is quite possibly going to be the shortest video I've ever made it's a lovely dish it goes great on top of rice on top of noodle in the soup but either way it's kimchi it's delicious its Southeast Asian inspired so let's get going and I'll see you on the other side all right now to make this Vietnamese style kimchi what I have here is napa cabbage that's wilted okay I won't do this overnight I have julienne of scallion I have julienne of carrot and I have some finely slivered red onion okay and I have some cucumber now the cucumber I added in about three hours ago I don't let the cucumber wilt overnight because it just gets too mushy but I do wilt the cabin the onion the scallion and the carrot overnight and then about 3-4 hours prior to making this dish I'll add the cucumber for that extra crunch but all of it is very well wilted nice and soft I rinsed off the excess salt and what we need to make is the kimchi paste so let's get going so to make this paste if you have some fresh Birds Eye chilies good use them if you don't you could use this store-bought chilli paste it's just as good three or four tablespoons right here that's about what I'm gonna add just depends on how spicy you want your kimchi to be and I do want this a bit spicy and to that I'm going to add some ginger gotta have ginger gotta have garlic it's kimchi okay gotta have garlic gotta have some sugar up to you one tablespoon - I'm using about two tablespoons of brown sugar okay you could use white whatever you have okay you use a little bit of fish sauce to get it rolling some rice vinegar I have to have some moisture in there to get it oh here's one some lemongrass okay for fragrance and for a certain amount of flavor and because this is Vietnamese style Southeast Asia I have some dried kaffir lime leaves okay now sometimes it's very hard to get fresh kaffir lime leaves and believe you meet the dry ones work just as well and have a lot of concentrated flavor this is a very simple paste okay it's a very simple paste very easy kimchi recipe and I'm gonna grind this down pulse pulse okay guys now what you'll notice is that I didn't make a rice flour glue like I do for the Korean kimchi but what I am going to use for a thickener is a nice healthy tablespoon of sesame Tina okay not quite indicative of this recipe but as I always tell people it's open to interpretation so I'm going to add that sesame to eita as a thickener and I'm gonna pulse it in alright so here the wilted vegetable and here is my Vietnamese kimchi paste okay pepper sesame kaffir lime leaves lemongrass garlic ginger and I'm just gonna toss this in by hand I'm not even gonna wear gloves cuz I'm not gonna worry about it okay I'm just gonna toss this in by hand there we go gonna get all these vegetables nice and coated there we go fish sauce sugar okay it's not a standard style kimchi like the Korean stuff okay this is Vietnamese style okay there we go and that's it okay that's it nice and tossed okay nice and blend it in okay and I'm gonna let this sit for about an hour or two and then I'm gonna put it on top of some noodles so hang on tight alright guys there it is Vietnamese kimchi on top of some fettuccine noodles I could have used oriental noodles I could used bon rice stick noodles I could have used soba Korean I could have used Sudan I could use on second thought I could used any noodle I wanted to but I picked fettuccine and I put this Vietnamese kimchi on top okay like I said napa cabbage carrot red onion scallion cucumber okay rice vinegar this is just delicious now what you do with it once it's put on top of the noodle or once it's put on top of the rice is you add just a little bit of sesame oil you could also ferment these vegetables in Nuuk jump you guys have seen me make nuke jump before alright then on top just a little bit of sesame seed okay toasted white black whatever you want really doesn't matter because like I say all the time the reason I like Asian food is because it's all interchangeable they all suit each other no matter what anybody says okay all Asian recipes suit each other no matter what country there it is with the sesame seeds and the sesame oil looks just delicious now I got to whip out my chopsticks and eat this from my dinner I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see you on the next video take care thank you guys Richard Blaine here mister easy cooking I want to thank you for stopping by my easy Cooking Channel tonight I hope you enjoyed this quick and easy Vietnamese kimchi like I said this has got to be the shortest video I have ever made but this Vietnamese style kimchi is just delicious it's aromatic it's fragrant it's different than regular Korean kimchi because it has the wonderful flavors and the wonderful aromas of the lemongrass and the kaffir lime leaves it's just delicious make this recipe it's a wonderful summer salad it goes great on top of rice it goes great on noodles okay throw it into some soup anything you want to do is just delicious I want to thank you for stopping by in my next video take care you
