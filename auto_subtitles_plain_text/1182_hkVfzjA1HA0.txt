 welcome back to another sushi video recipe my name's Dave Devaux and today I'm going to show you guys something quite special I hope you guys enjoy it and let's get straight into it alright so for this recipe what you're going to do is you're going to make smooth cuts of salmon and tuna you want them to be more or less five fingers long so just cut the pieces of fish at the required length about so alright so five fingers for me is about ten centimeters which is 2.5 inches there we go and now basically you just want to create a nice smooth long pieces of sashimi there we go beautiful so just drag your knife through it if your knife isn't sharp enough to do it then you can sharpen it or you can buy one of these amazing knives you can check out my store link is just peel on top left corner and there you can see everything about sharpening the knife and also buying one of these okay so just a couple of cuts we need of each some of salmon and then some of two and now here the the piece of tuna is extruding a little bit so what I'm going to do is just do one little cut just to make it all even and this can be used for the tartare later don't worry about it no nothing goes to waste here and you just want to be reason to be thin not too thin because they are going to go around like a roll so okay beautiful no yeah alright so you simply take a little piece of rice you want to be quite small because you don't want to go over the top like so okay then you take a slice avocado put it round taking care to put the green line on the top this gives it a nice aesthetic look when it's finished now you wrap it in your fish this one salmon okay perfect alright and now I had a very thin strip of nori seaweed paper just to keep it all together okay now make the tuna one again a very small bowl of rice not too big then add your strip of avocado very thinly sliced just round with the dark green pot on top and then add your piece of fish this one is going to be tuna just wrapped around lightly perfect now you press the rice a little bit deeper good and now to keep it all together a very thin strip of nori seaweed paper make it thin don't make it too big and just wrap it around I find the theater they are the more pretty little stuff now set to one side and make the tartare now to make some salmon and tuna tartare or you needed a little off cuts of two to end the sum that you had before and just simply chop the extremely fine just like so there we go once you've done the main job just turn around and then just do another rough chop sorry perfect so that's the tune-up wipe your knife off add in the salmon so just chop it up into nice fine little tartare there we go beautiful alright once you've chopped it up transfer it over to some bowls just like so add a little bit of sriracha sauce I prefer this make I try to love other ones and this one's the best so just a tiny little bit of that a very small dash of soya sauce add a squirt of lime juice just to give it a little kick okay and then some chopped chives all right perfect now just mix beautiful okay so now just squish the rice a little bit deeper if it's coming out too far you want to be able to really keep this stuff okay so with the tuna one I'm going to put the salmon just like so [Music] there we go [Music] okay here and then with the salmon one I'm going to put the tuna on top this gives it a beautiful contrast of colors like to mix it up okay so you just add some of the spicy tuna tartare beautiful and then you just finish it off a little bit of chopped chives on top there we go very little goes a long way of this voila finito I hope you guys enjoyed this these are delicious and they varied like this if you want you can dip in a little bit of soya sauce with wasabi but I mean they're already seasoned and they go a little bit spice to it so it just even like so thank you for watching another one of my sushi videos I hope you guys enjoy it as I did making it and just if you want to see more of my sushi videos I make them every week and you can do so by subscribing to my channel on the top left foot of your screen and if you want to see more my right this second but you're that excited about it then just click on the right as you can see all my other videos thank you for watching I appreciate Facebook shares and likes and comments just go crazy I goodbye you
