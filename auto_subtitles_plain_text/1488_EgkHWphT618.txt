 welcome to show me the curry calm and the nutria and I'm hippo and today we're going to show you how to make two bodies it's an integral part of any Indian meal and here's what you'll need whole wheat flour one-and-a-half cups salt quarter teaspoon or to taste oil three teaspoons water approximately 1/2 cup okay we're going to make the dough now we're going to add our flour to a bowl sprinkle the salt and this is optional in case you know you don't use salt that's fine to incorporate it well then we'll pour oil inside now you want to mix the flour again to make sure all the oil is incorporated into the flour and you don't want lumps of oil in there just for a few seconds okay oil and salt is nicely incorporated so we're going to add water slowly this water has been warmed in the microwave for about 30 seconds we're in a little at a time and just mix and have a what kind of whole wheat flour is it the one from the regular grocery store no actually this is a power from the Indian store it's a little different from the whole wheat flour that you find in the grocery stores the one in the American grocery stores usually is a lot darker in color so it's about to turn a little browner than you probably like them this one is available in any Indian store it's called chapati akka ATT a and readily available and just mix all that dough in and form like nice ball Wow it really it doesn't take a lot of time at all a lot of people are scared to do this because you're using your hands and the freaks people help but it's really not that bad I mean literally it takes under a minute to make the stone okay the dough is in a nice ball so we're going to take just a couple of drops of oil just to lightly coat it and that way it doesn't form a dry skin on top of the dough okay so the dough is nicely coated with just a few drops of oil and we're going to keep it covered for about 15 to 20 minutes so if you're not comfortable using your hands while making the dope here's another alternative way of doing it here is the Holy flour I'm going to use the food processor and if you notice I'm using a chopping blade and setup for dough blade because it just mixes better and it gets all the edges and there's nothing left of the sides and then mix in the salt at this point and I'm going to give it a mix and then I'm going to add in the oil ok I've also heated up the water for 30 seconds and I'm going to pour it in very slowly once I have the food processor on all right wow that was easy yes let's start okay I would just give it one knead by hand just to incorporate everything make sure there's no air bubbles and all in it this food processor option is really good if you're making going bulk because I understand that dough freezes really well right right and I always do that I'd do the whole 20 pound bag and keep it and just stick on one one you know ball at a time and just use it every day and with something to put a couple of drops of oil and just smother it a little bit of it a little bit so that it doesn't dry out and cover it up set it aside for 15 minutes before I use it all right otta has been resting for about 15 to 20 minutes and we're going to need it one time quickly so how many toboggans does this mater well this is one and a half cups of dry flour it makes approximately 90 puppies so there's no science involved you know if you like really big chapatis it can be less or if you want small ones you know it'll make more but something that fits into your palm a closed fist that's I don't know this goal size yeah about a gulfside maybe a little bit too bigger than a golf size okay so just divide it out before we start rolling out our chapatis we'll go ahead and turn on our stove and get our tan even this is called a Baba you can also use the nonstick friend right if you if you just don't have this er cannot find it then a nonstick also works and what heats have you put on the suit this is about medium a little bit higher than medium okay and you want to make sure your pan is really hot before you put your first chapati on alright while our pan is heating we're going to take our dough and form a nice round ball if you start off with a round ball chances are your final chapati will probably be round also we're going to dip it in some dry flour shake off the excess and roll it out now this rolling pin is my favourite it's a thinner version but a lot of people are used to the thicker versus rolling pins whatever you have is absolutely fine and if you notice that your chapati is sticking to the ground or you know whatever surface you're rolling it out on take it and dip it again in the dry flour well you make it look so easy this is really easy but the key is it takes a lot of practice and you know when you first start chances are your two parties will not be around and that's perfectly okay they're still going to taste great the more you do this the better chances you have of getting a prettier final product and this is a trick that my mom taught me about is learning how to do this when I was little you rub your hand across it and instantly you'll feel where it's thicker and where it's thinner and then you can just roll the parts that are thicker that way you don't have it too cocky which is really thin on one side and really thick on the other side that also helps it in blowing up when you're cooking it alright that looks hot so we're going to put our roll chapatti and kind of move it around too to make sure it doesn't stick and we leave it alone until we start seeing bubbles appearing so we're going to flip it around then go for a few seconds now we're going to take some oil and you can just dip your spoon into your oil and then whatever is left for Mainer remainder a few drops just put it on and smear it on like that you flip it around you want to press where it bubbles to force the air into the other side which is not risen a Samaritan boil again and press you want to cook the chapati until you see that all the dough eNOS is gone and it looks fully cooked and it's okay to have little brown spots on it this is very very old Ricky Bobby there's really no replacement you can buy these from the store but when you taste these like fresh off the squirrel it's awesome and one of the other reasons a lot of people don't use oil in their to parties but I put oil inside the dough and what happens with that is that when you eat the chapati a little bit later on it still tastes nice and soft as opposed to the dough which has been prepared without oil it turns to 10 you tend to turn a little bit chewier right once your body is cooked I like to keep it in a nice insulated canister like this it helps it to stay nice and warm so you can finish all your chapatis and then sit with your family and enjoy your dinner and they'll still be piping hot so there we have it fresh homemade to Bobby's so join us again on another episode of show me are you calm and in a pinch of spice to your life
