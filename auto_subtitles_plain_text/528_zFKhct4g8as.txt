 I have my big giant tamale caught that I'm going to use today for my I'm chopped to clam shop is what my dollars used to call clam chowder when they were little so clam chop suits and I've got all of my ingredients here and i'll give you exact measurements on my site and i'm going to start with a cast iron skillet i'm heating it up with a medium medium-high flame and i'm going to put some bacon in there and fry it up and this is not a diet recipes sorry you damn making clam chowder and I you can see the photo montage before this what I did i fried some bacon I removed the bacon after was nice and crisp then I added some chopped or diced celery and onions and then i added a stick of butter and yes I set a stick of butter and I'm going to add a quarter cup of cornstarch this is going to be my sicken ER for my soup and I'm helping us enough because I'm making a pretty large factor since been up for probably 20 people so I'm adding the cornstarch in and stirring it into the butter mixture here good thing you're not corn starch is if you need more you just send it with water and you add it then I'm going to add a cup of half-and-half to this mixture you can use milk you can use olive oil instead of butter and bacon fat to saute everything in this is just want my soup to be really nice and Hardy and rich so I'm kind of making it in a traditional way I don't know their salaries traditional it accelerate except i like it so we're going to stir this and just let it come you know get pretty pretty sick should get pretty sick and I have milk to add just in case and on this side we have a pot a large my tamale pot of potatoes and for Kansas plan min stencil boiling so the potatoes need to get soft basically you don't want them should be mushy that you don't want that you want to be forced tender for your shoes otherwise I'll just become a potato cyst which is really good which is what I'm making for somebody who's special today because she's my clam chowder okay back to this so this is my face and like I said I do have them if you have a little bit of milk on standby here usually I make this in a lower fat version and I'll use like I said some olive oil to saute everything and then I use cornstarch and like a two percent milk sometimes i use evaporated milk pretty much whatever i have on him and what's on sale what's in my budget since i went to the 99 cent store this morning i found a lot of stuff there my bags of potatoes that I used were dollar sixty-nine my cans of clowns were a little bit pricier and then I found some and another shore for 99 cents so shop around and you'll be able to make really good mill on a budget okay so we're going to let this Vic and I'm going to turn my flame up just a little bit so we can speed up the process because we have a I have another soup to reheat which was my cream of broccoli and I'm going to actually add some sharp cheddar to that and I'll show you how to make a cheddar cream cheddar cheese sauce that i use for my homemade mac and cheese and it's going to go into the soup securing it letting it get nice and thick maybe need to let it boil huh oh my my daughter makes his face like oh funny we would feel more selfish purchase we look wonderful hug and with the potatoes that are boiling with the clamp I through the Jewson unless you have a brand of clams which I had one time that we're really sandy you can throw the juices and I'm going to throw in some sea salt about that's probably about it two teaspoons the sages will absorb a lot of salt okay natalja coming back to this and here is getting really super thick now you can kind of see it should be nice and stick like that coding aston i'm going to go ahead and send this down with a little tiny bit of milk if I need to I can always mash up some of the potatoes create a better consistency for my clam chowder but this is going to go into this big pot and it won't go in until the potatoes are nice and fausto and this is what's going to make York lamb chops nice and creamy and before I put this in to the pot I will put I bacon crumbly bacon in there so enjoy and adjust your seasonings after the soft little salt maybe some white pepper and you're good to go thanks
