 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you a recipe for what I call like french fried onions or just fried onion strings now I know I made onion rings here not too long ago but I wanted to share this recipe with you because it's really really easy and because Thanksgiving is right around the corner if you know know that in America here we love our green bean casserole and most people top it with those french fried onions that come in a can um I think it's my control freakiness that comes out when I have to make them from scratch because I don't like using a lot of things out of cans and in french fried onions are one of those things I love to make it home and they're so easy you'll need some onions of course you'll need some whole milk and then just some flour with some salt black pepper granulated onion and paprika and some vegetable oil for frying that's it they're really simple they're really easy but I figured I'll share it with you because I am going to be showing you a recipe for my green bean casserole here very soon and I'm gonna top it with homemade french fried onions and I know a lot of people ask me for the recipe so I figured I might as well now normally you use one or two really big onions I don't have any really big onions so I'm just using biggest onions I have and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut the top and bottom and then just get rid of the very first layer and now I know most people use buttermilk and I use buttermilk when I make my onion rings but the point about these for me is that they're so thin and they hardly had any real thick coating on them keeping them super super crispy and I feel like buttermilk it's too thick and it coats the onions too much it's just my thinking well what I'm gonna do is thinly slice these onions I want these onions to be as thin as I possibly can manage that's just because that's how I like them that's how they should be they don't have to be perfectly round that you just wanted to be as thin as you can manage I don't really use a mandolin I really find mandolins to be really dangerous I did caught myself once I cut off a good chunk of my my thumb so I haven't really used one since so I just say get as you can with your knife do you best as you can see I went kind of on an angle here a little bit to get some thinner strips I'm only gonna do one threaten it today just because there's not many and I'm I'm really upset right now onions always make me cry I can't help it the key is to really go at them as thin as you can and then I just take my little rounds and I kind of make a little slit in them like this so that when they fry it's just a whole lovely thin string of goodness and now I'm going to cover these with some milk just whole milk and these are going to sit in the milk for about an hour or so and then when there's already I will show you the next my onions have been soaking for about an hour I've got some vegetable oil up to 375 degrees in a little pot here and now I'm gonna do is just stir my flour together with my paprika and my onion powder now I wanted to add onion powder especially in this because I feel like when you taste those french fried onions you really taste like onions and I want to kind of get you know it's like a hum on the back of the back of your mouth when you're tasting this because they're soaked in milk so a lot of the onion flavor does come out but trust me when I tell you these are going to be fantastic so now I'm going to do now is I'm gonna do this a few at a time I also have a plate here with some paper towel just to catch when I put them on I don't want any of the oil and I just take a few out of time and as you can see they're not sort of heavily heavily coated so just lightly coated put that into my hot oil and let those cook for a few minutes and so they're really nice and crispy and then when they are done that will take no time and when they're ready just put them all on your paper towel lines plate and just keep on going last batch and of course I know I don't have to tell you that we've already been snacking on them they're so good that's the thing about when you're working with fried food which is why I do not do it very often at all you tend to never leave the scene of the crime I mean you just stand right here and just pick and pick and pick but that's at its best when they had it comes out of the fryer the frying oil I'm gonna make sure you season them some salt as soon as they come out of the oil and taste this one down here come on phenomenal you're delicious crispy to the max they don't have a very strong onion flavor which is fabulous if you don't really like that strong flavor but these are gonna be perfect as is to munch on too on top of my homemade green bean casserole it is out-of-this-world delicious put a Laura in the kitchen on complicate this recipe I hope you enjoy spending time with me and I will see you next time okay you
