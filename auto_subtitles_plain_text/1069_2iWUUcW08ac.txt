 doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo pancakes pancakes it's like a someone's running away from like the cops thing pancakes pancakes cops cops suck hey what's up guys I'm Matty Matheson we're here in Parkdale Toronto we're about to make some pancakes I love pancakes you guys should love pancakes let's make some pancakes you've never had pancakes like this because these ones are gonna be the best pancakes you've ever had I make the best pancakes in the world try to with me on this you can too all right so to make pancakes you need a few ingredients here this is everything that you need to make a perfect pancake you need flour what's up you got some buttermilk if you don't have buttermilk you can use just milk and then add some white vinegar to it just like a tablespoon that'll sour it up for you we need that baking soda Arm and Hammer and then we got some baking powder the magic powder don't put it in your nose then we got Pam we've got the grease Lord the og we've got blueberries for blueberry pancakes little bananas some beautiful eggs at room temperature we got some butter at room temperature last but not least for pancakes and Canada at least I know what you guys are eating pancakes anywhere else you need some maple syrup my son eat a pancake was about three weeks ago I had a pancake at work it was great these are all the tools you need you need a whisk you need a spatula you need a spoon or a ladle a dirty-ass strainer sifter we're gonna sift the dry ingredients so first you always got to remember you got to separate your dry and your wet ingredients right guys so first well we're gonna start with two cups of flour we're gonna sift all of the ingredients you got that trap house vibe making the fish-scale here get the fish-scale you want the flower to be lumpy when you're making pancakes but you don't want the starting base to lumpy then we're gonna add I like my shits sugary so I'm gonna add some sugar that was about like three tablespoons so baking powder you always need a little bit more than baking soda baking soda is like the crazy and baking powder is the stuff that'll make it like fluffy so we just need a little bit like five key bumps that and then you got baking soda just a little bit and then we just sift that stuff in there oh also when always baking you always got to remember a little pinch of salt and then we just sift that stuff we got our flour baking soda baking powder salt sugar so there is your dry mix now to make your wet mix we're gonna need some eggs I need to melt some butter really quickly this is what not to do this pan is way too  hot this butter is now brown hot this butter is now brown butter bush-league move you gotta start again you're a idiot okay so now we got to start over because I up that last so take about this much butter that's about like two tablespoons of butter you don't want it to be brown you want to be nice and yellow so to make really good pancakes I'm gonna separate the eggs with the yolks and the whites to separate whites and yolks you can just pour it back and forth and let the shell kind of cut off the egg yolks and whites so for this amount of flour we're gonna need four eggs see this yolk see this yolk broke that's no good okay now check this out we're gonna take the egg whites we're gonna just stir them up pretty much a whiskey sour down here we're gonna add some buttermilk at home you'll probably do about two cups which is about that much okay so then we have our yolks so we're just gonna stir these guys up we're gonna add a little bit of sugar that's a lot of sugar that's okay so we're just gonna stir this up I should have got a smaller bowl to do this idiot I'm gonna add some butter so when you're pouring something like warm like this into egg yolks or any kind of eggs and stuff make sure it's not hot hot because it's gonna just turn your into scrambled eggs okay so there we go so we had our egg yolks and our sugar and our butter and then we had our egg whites with our buttermilk then we can find those guys and then we had all of our dry ingredients and then we combined those and we stir those in now we're just gonna pour in the flour the biggest way people up pancakes is by over stirring pancakes you don't want to become flat and dense you want to just fold it in just enough to make them kind of fluffy and those clumps of flour let you see that you think might be weird or really good because they'll make things fluffier when you're frying up the pancakes I'm gonna put this in the fridge for a little second let this kind of just sit and marinate okay we're gonna make classic just pancakes and maple syrup and then we're also going to throw some some blueberries in some and we're gonna throw some little bananas in some too these bananas are cute aren't they and then you can just cut them up here we got some nice local nature ripe blueberries they're from product in the USA so we're gonna use those guys let's start making some pancakes so you can kind of see it's kind of set up there now Pam so spray out the Pam all you youtube trolls probably gonna call mine on how much Pam I just put in the pan  you how about that you
