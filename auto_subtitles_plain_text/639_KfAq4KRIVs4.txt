do you mean I'm adding too much oil that you have any closed-circuit camera in my kitchen or what yeah because you seem to be calling only when I'm just adding some oil or some fry what do you mean I'm looking for that see have you ever heard about these camera techniques you know people look little bigger than what they are and this oil also is the same thing you know I had little oil it looks as if I'm adding olive oil that that if I listen to everything you say you will expect me to find things in water that cooking is that one happen that way that I know the chicken and eggs story that I know you came before me you know better than me that I eat a lot of vegetables that I do eat okay I'll cook more vegetables no fat nothing that if you think you are a better cook baby why don't you start your own show yeah yeah I know you're funny than me okay okay that okay I'm in middle of the show can I call you back later okay thanks okay can you believe this man my father when he was my age he would literally eat a lamp at it and I just need a chicken a day and he's got problem with it okay let's redo everything [Music] hello namaste Salam alikoum statical welcome back to another session with your worship at pareve calm today I'm going to show you how to make beautiful lamb curry using lamb shacks what is lamb shanks you may ask lamb shank is the meat part below the knee of your lap you know and the beat is very beautiful and then there is lot of gelatinous substance along with this meat and you get a lamb marrow that gets cooked along with it and it makes this preparation even more tasty and one more very beautiful thing today is you know how you all send me suggestions and ideas and so on so a lot of you people have been asking a chef can you teach us how to cook food without adding much oil and so on so today we will make this beautiful lamb shanks without adding any extra oil we are just going to cook this preparation within the fat that is there in the meat so to make this preparation without any fat added the best thing to do preparation is using a pressure cooker see pressure cooker is a wonderful invention because first thing is largely some preparations can be cooked really fast on the pressure and all these tough meats you can cook in no time and we are going to learn lot of dishes we can make without adding a drop of oil into the food so today to prepare this preparation I am going to use this pressure cooker so it is very very easy whenever you are cooking without fat you want all the ingredients to cook really good so what we are going to do they're going to add all the ingredients I've got some green chilies I'm going to add some onion 1 tablespoon of coriander powder 1/2 a teaspoon of garam masala poedel see because we are not adding any oil we are not spying anything so I rather use garam masala powder then whole garam masala kick and use 1 tbsp of ginger-garlic paste chilli powder to your taste I am going to add half a teaspoon of chilli powder very little of turmeric add half of the coriander leaves also you know I've got some coconut milk this gives very beautiful taste to the lamb preparation so I'm adding some coconut milk then I've got this lamb shank look at this beautiful there is really big pieces I love to cook lamb shanks this way I don't like to cut into small pieces just add into this I also I am going to add tomato puree but I'm not going to add tomato puree to this because I want this meat to be cooked well if you add tomatoes into this the meat is going to be little bit tougher so what I'm going to do I'm going to add this tomatoes at a later point of time and you can add 1 and 1/2 cup of water to this see you can notice this lamb has some fat little bit attached to it and that is good enough and actually in fact the fact that is there on the meat itself gives very nice flavor so I'm just going to mix this little bit make sure you do not have too much quantity in a pressure cooker make sure it is less than 50% of the total capacity of your pressure cooker then very simple put the lid and switch on the stuff a lot of times people cook their food based on the number of visuals so if you cook your regular meat with two results cook this lamb shanks for three whistles after three visits switch off the pressure cooker and wait for 10 minutes for the pressure cooker to cool down and then before you open the lid make sure you release the pressure and then open the lid so okay now look at this meat off now if you look at this meat it is coming off the bone that means this meat is really nicely cooked but I want to add some tomato puree so what I'm going to do first I'm going to remove this meat so this is another reason why I kept this meat into big pieces because I want to remove this big pieces out easily if I have small pieces it would be very difficult to remove them okay now I am going to add this freshly ground Tomatoes okay I'm going to add to this if you want you can put the pressure cooker one more time and cook it and this tomato will be cooked in no time but I am just going to leave this lid open and going to cook it like this and see lot of people think fat is oil is bad or whatever see if your body can handle a little bit of fat use it but if you really are on a diet or something like that there are so many dishes that we can cook without adding a drop of oil in fact my father started the cooking lot of dishes without oil and he often sends me this recipes so we're going to cook lot of these things but you have to understand see when there is no oil or anything when you eat it kind of starts in your throat so how to eat if a nice kitchen is there heat it along with a nice write up so we are going to learn the order of preparations where they're going to being fat free that is we are not going to add any extra oil into the cooking so be tuned and we will cook those wonderful factory dishes for you one best way to know our dish is ready most of the time since when the oil oozes out pressure cooker is one beautiful thing here is cook the ingredients very well retaining all the moisture and juices within and more importantly flavors you get concentrated flavors when you cook in a pressure cooker and now you can see this beautiful all the ingredients are cooked even the onions and tomatoes everything is cooked well and then you can add this lamb to this Wow it is really really good but you know just let it cook in a slow flame for like 15 minutes and your dish will be ready you know themselves beautiful this lamb curry is ready and look at this meat it is falling off the bone for you keep this beautiful ah okay I'm gonna add some coriander to this okay look at this beautiful meat let me taste this ah Wow so friends so have you seen how you can cook this beautiful lamb shank curry without adding a drop of oil but if you want to convert this into your steel you can add potatoes and mix vegetables into this
