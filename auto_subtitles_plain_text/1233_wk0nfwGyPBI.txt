 hi guys thanks for joining me for part two of the eggs benedict recipe we're gonna get straight on into it because I'm hungry so what you're going to need is a English muffin now I've made mine from scratch I might stick up a video later on I've had to how to do that but if you just got the English muffin from the supermarket we're just gonna split them toast them and then stick them on a plate and when it's kind of lightly butter them while we're doing this we are cooking some strips of bacon as you see here make sure your hand is on a high heat you don't want to boil the bacon you want to fry it a little bit oil the fat and the bacon will render itself out so it'll cook it and the fat as well so lightly fry your bacon and then once it's done you can put it on some paper towels to get rid of the excess oil and fat and if you guys haven't checked out my poached egg video a little link here you can check it out but basically we just got our pot of water here really put in our poached eggs now always do your poached eggs one at a time two in the same pot really don't go along well together so be patient 180 good time and then we can once they cook we can move on to construct our eggs benedict breakfast so like I said we've got our English muffin yep lightly buttered no unless you can either put down some hollandaise sauce before our bacon I haven't chosen not to so he's going to put lay it out strips of bacon across our English muffin and then of course on top of that goes our poached eggs so you can have one you can have two you can even have three if you're really up for it so two eggs here and now finally our hollandaise sauce that we've prepared earlier in our earlier video now like I said you've just warm this up slightly so we can dress this across the top of our eggs now put a liberal amount on you don't want to go not enough you don't want to go too much it can be quite sickening if you quite rich and sickening if you have too much of it so just go easy on it so as in seer this is running off her eggs and to finish this recipe off chopped up parsley but a cracked pepper across the top of it Bob is your uncle there you have it look and very easy Eggs Benedict and I bet you didn't have to go and pay lots of money at the cafe for it so there you have it I hope you guys enjoy it I am definitely gonna be having this next Sunday morning I hope you too I hope you do as well
