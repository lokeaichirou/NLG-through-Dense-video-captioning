 I love sushi I love it so much and after years of eating it I decided to teach myself how to make it and now I want to teach you so please enjoy these video tutorials on how to make western-style sushi please rate and comment today I'm going to show you how to make a spicy tuna roll with cucumber and toasted sesame seeds on the outside so let's start off with the yellowfin tuna I get this previously frozen at sea Sall it out it comes in its own vacuum packed back you can get a steak or you can get a loin like this and then I take the pieces that I have left over from making sushi sashimi and just give it a rough chop like you see here and then I add the Sriracha hot sauce inside this world we're also gonna add nice fresh crisp cucumber slices they add a nice coolness and a crunch to the roll and then on top we'll have toasted sesame seeds and I also like to add in for presentation purposes some of the black seeds as well and to start off we're gonna have a half a sheet of nori seaweed and a palm full oh so she prepared rice and gently with wet hands pressed that out to the edge we'll sprinkle some of our toasted sesame seeds on and then also our black ones I like doing it at this stage because you get it on the whole roll it really gives a nice presentation effect sometimes all the way to the end but to be really thorough get a nice even coat of of sesame seeds on the outside do it when it's flat and this we're gonna add in the spicy tuna now the big thing here is you want to get a uniform amount so the rolls consistent sometimes it's easier said than done especially when you go and roll it up but you want to try the best you can to get a nice even layer of the spicy tuna and next we're going to add in the cucumber slices like I said it really mellows it out a bit and gives it a nice crunch a nice crispness in the roll now holding that filling down with my fingers I'm going to press it down and then fold it over just a little bit more to seal it look how nice that is with the toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds on top now I'm using a wet serrated knife to cut the roll in half and once you cut the roll in half line it up again and then cut that in half again make sure you clean your knife off in between cuts have a wet terry cloth towel there just to wipe it off and next we're going to plate our spicy tuna roll now you can add some mayonnaise in there maybe some toasted sesame seed or some masago in the tuna to make it a little different and here I have a rectangle plate that has a smaller reservoir where I put the wasabi pickled ginger and the spicy mayonnaise for the roll that's a really nice look and presentation I hope you enjoyed this video tutorial on how to make a spicy tuna roll with cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds on the outside please rate and comment and enjoy the sushi
