 gosh I chicken is a spicy chicken recipe from the Bengal region usually they use a whole chicken and in western countries we like to use the Cornish hen for our recipe we're going to need these ingredients two pounds are about one kilogram of Cornish hen meat cleaned and washed one cup of onion paste one cup of tomato paste 1 tablespoon of garlic paste 1 tablespoon of ginger paste 2 tablespoons of yogurt a teaspoon of turmeric powder a teaspoon of red chili powder one teaspoon of cumin powder 1 teaspoon of coriander powder 2 way leaves 4 to 6 cardamom pods 4 to 6 cloves 2 or 3 cinnamon sticks 2 teaspoons of garlic ala 4 to 6 tablespoons of mustard oil and optionally you guys can use it 1 tsp of ki and 1 tsp of sugar but that's up to you and then salt to taste our recipe has three main steps first you'll marinate the chicken meat with onion garlic ginger and other spices then you'll cook that marinated meat with the tomato paste until the oil separates out from the spices and then you'll do that until the food has a nearly dry consistency when there isn't that much gravy left so to the cleaned and washed chicken meat you'll add the onion paste the garlic paste the ginger paste yogurt turmeric powder red chilli powder cumin powder coriander powder salt and the mustard oil and then marinade the chicken well with all of these ingredients and then cover it and set that aside for about 10 to 20 minutes minimum but if you do have the time marinating the chicken for several hours to overnight would be ideal turn on the stove with a pan on the burner spread the oil within the pan and when the oils hot add the bay leaf the cardamom the clothes the cinnamon sticks and stir when these spices start to pop you can add the marinated chicken sir stir the meat occasionally so that it doesn't burn [Music] and after about 10 minutes add the tomato paste next you'll cook this for about a half an hour until the oil separates out from the spices and until emotional water has evaporated away then add the garam masala and now you can have the sugar if you'd like to but this part is optional and at this point you can have the key which is also optional but it always makes things a little bit better and then mix and that's it this serves about three or four people [Music] and you can serve the cautious chicken with veggies Lucci or hot steamed rice you
