 I welcome to four side kitchen with our permanent guest chef Cody night a how's it going i am your host a of the richard Codey what are we doing today today we're going to be making shepherd's pie it's a British classic or Irish depending on which one you talk to you they all claim it we're cooking with practically everything you already have at home the only thing you should have to go out and buy his ground lamb other than that you have all the stuff you could use ground beef if you want but that would be a cottage by same thing just a little bit different flavor so we're going to cook with today we got our potatoes you got one and a half carats a fourth cup of peas half an onion two to three cloves of garlic a fourth cup of flour ground lamb you got some pepper we have a port wine some ketchup we're just going to throw in there mix of rosemary thyme and bay leaf I think it's actually pronounced fine Cody I know it's time there's a th at the beginning but it's time okay well we'll agree to disagree alright our chicken stock two egg yolks our Parmesan cheese and just a salt pepper mix so we're going to do first Taylor is we're going to peel our potatoes and our carrots okay now if you want to start peeling our potatoes we're going to do is just going to peel them and to leave about one fourth of the skin on them you want to leave a fourth of the skin on there yeah you want me to cut it in four pieces and just not peel working no no just just peel it and leave about a fourth of the skin on that okay well logistics of that you aren't very good but ok we're going to do that because we want some skin on in our mashed potatoes and while he does that I'm gonna peel some of our carrots about a quarter mmm a little more looks good when we're done feeling these Taylor I'm gonna have you cut those potatoes into force and I'm going to grate all our vegetables and the reason we're grading our vegetables is so they get really mushy in there it'd almost be like a puree you want me to really know they're in there my baby too that's right kinda looks like a pimple so when you get it really small like this you know kinda just be careful of your fingers don't want to cut yourself grieving the garlic's the hardest part that's so small now that our potatoes are cut up our water is boiling which the oil pretty fast pretty convenient nth we're gonna throw thrower potatoes in or boiling water grant throw our meat into our hot pan we're just going to brown our meat while our potatoes just do their thing awesome all right now that our meat just about brown we go ahead and add our pepper release throw that around make sure it gets seasoned all around now we're going to run out of all our veggies that we've got up we shredded look at you got a nice color in there now how's it going you know it's cooking it's the exciting part wait for it all to hell together yeah it's wild so what now Cody we waited on our veggies to get nice and mushy and we're just about at that point so we're going to mix in our flour we're going to steer real well make sure it gets in all to me because that's going to be the base for our gravy so now we're just going to put it to kind of heavy shots of ketchup really mix it in there just like we did with our flour we're gonna make sure it's all nice and mixed in there so I have the lemon one now it's no lemon I don't know where you got no lemon where did you get a limb it's on the counter we're not using everything that's it we're going to do a shut a heavy shot of a port of mine so after you cook out your wine you're going to throw in all your herbs once again mix mix well that's the key to this recipe just mixing it all in well alright while we're waiting on our potatoes and our meat we can go ahead and separate our egg yolks so if you just want to crack it you know separate it you just crack it and then pass the yolk back and forth and the white will fall out yeah there you go good job job my friend I'm gonna check on the meat all right all right so we're gonna hit it with our chicken stock and that's going to make our gravy we're only going to cook it for about two minutes you'll want to reduce it too much do that it's already starting to thicken up alright so we're just going to pour it right in here we're gonna spread it out nice and evenly okay so you have it nice and spread it out spread out yeah yeah so what we're gonna do is have you killed the heat on our potatoes and you know strain it so you go do that now spread it spread it thread its its wine okay so now I'm gonna have you take all of our extra leftover ingredients without the except for the egg whites I'm going to mix them all into this bowl right here so I'll get these egg whites so you don't forget okay and just start throwing them all together which one should i do first probably start with the potatoes okay that's pretty gross but so what kind of texture are we looking for with it Oh your basic mashed potato it's not going to be as creamy because we have the cheese in there and the eggs which are really sticking it together and we don't have the milk or the butter but you know your basic mashed potato texture we're going to scoop our potatoes right into our piping bag which you don't have to do this at home it's just for it'll just be for presentation only you can just spread it on evenly but we're gonna make it look nice and fancy your fancies good auntie is good so just little little bit so it'll be spread evenly throughout kind of like potato flower buds exactly right Taylor that's our final product about throw it in the oven for about 17 minutes it's preheated at 350 degrees what are you okay well you said hi it's just not it's it's a meat pie it's okay it's fine it's a trick it's fine it's fine truck trust me that's it'll be good okay it's just not what I was expecting it'll be good okay all right that's what we want with the nice golden brown tips all right so it's like one last thing to do and that's DJ go ahead and let's know how it is alright cool he's in carries and carries all right i don't like Carrie stripe that's really good all right it's good no all right thing ya go having taken a bite now I'm not sure about this one what are you sheepish just eat it Oh
