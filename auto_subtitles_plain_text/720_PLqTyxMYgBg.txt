 hi my name is Justin Wangler I'm the executive chef at kendall jackson winery and today we're preparing one of my favorite dishes grilled calamari you often see it fried and lots of restaurants but it's kind of under utilized as a grilled product gets an amazing carmelization and just really wonderful flavor so today we're pairing the dish with Kendall Jackson vintners reserve Pinot Noir grape fruit flavor in this one cherries cranberry a little bit of earthiness the salad that we're making is going to kind of pull in those cherry flavors and the earthy notes found in the Pinot so we're going to make a vinaigrette with a ingredient called you may plum paste it's from pickled plums from Japan along with some pinot noir virtue and pomegranate molasses and all those are great red fruit characteristics that will really tie in with the Pinot Noir so to get started we're going to start with some clean calamari and we're going to marinate it in a little bit of olive oil some fresh thyme a little bit of salt and I'm going to smash some garlic cloves upset give it a good whack there quick little shop man in here and we're also going to add a spice called sumac consume acts one of my favorite spices it's from the Mediterranean it works really well with Pinot Noir and sera it's got a sour kind of red berry cranberry flavor to it I'm just going to season that and this you could do even the night ahead of time it's just going to get more flavor into it so we'll just give this a little talk in the meantime we're going to set those off to the side and now we're going to melon ball some potatoes and pretty simple to do you just want to take the melon baller we got some water over here we're just going to add that to boiling salted water those are going to take about eight minutes to cook next we want to assemble the vinaigrette and we're going to start by using a little bit of that you may plum base here it's pretty strong it's salty it's sweet and sour it's gotta with the Japanese call it mommy it's the fifth flavor sense so there's a lot going on there we're going to add a little bit of soy sauce next rice wine vinegar Pinot Noir vers you then we're going to add a little bit of mirin which is a Japanese sweet cooking wine a little sesame paste which is often used in tahini pomegranate molasses give it a little pinch of salt there and we're just going to whisk in the sesame oil really really fragrant a lot of big flavors going on here we're just going to add a little bit of olive oil it's pretty much our vinaigrette and we will go into grilling the calm our necks so calamari could have marinated overnight we got a nice hot smoking grill pan we're just gonna add a calamari and calamari is one of those things that you want to either cook it really fast a really slow so we're just going to put these in here and they're going to take just a couple minutes to cook we're gonna do the tentacles as well there and I begin to brown on one side and then we'll flip it in the meantime we're going to add some cherries and get a little caramelization on them they just have a little bit of olive oil on them we're just going to brown the potatoes in a little butter it's a little bit of salt and the sumac you can really smell it in the air kind of smells toasty and nutty and a little bit of a cranberry aroma cherries are looking good and then we're just going to give the calamari a rough chop we can actually throw the tentacles right in the bowl just kind of bite-size pieces you can pop the cherries off and into the bowl as well well the cow line so now the potatoes have become golden brown we're just going to add those to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients this point we just need to give the salad at all check it for seasoning and then we can plate it up and taste it with the Pinot Noir you can see the lettuce is warmed up and welted a little bit so just make a little pile out in the middle there some calamari in the front just kind of nice rustic dish really nice smoky sweet salty so many flavors going on and this nice crisp acidity of the pinot just kind of pulls it all together
