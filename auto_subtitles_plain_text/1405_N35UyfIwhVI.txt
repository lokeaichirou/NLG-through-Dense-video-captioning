 so I'm gonna make some foxy pancakes which is basically a potato pancake and I'm using rooster potatoes today I'm gonna peel them grate them squeeze out the moisture of them I'm gonna use some mashed potato cooked it yesterday chilled it it's good it's better actually out of the fridge a little bit of flour this is actually a wheat-free flour amusing so we're gonna make a duplicate C today and some fresh Irish milk first of all I'm gonna peel it and then I got a grape this into a cloth I get my tea towel and the reason I'm grating it into the cloth is because I need to extract as much moisture as I can out of the potato and it's amazing how much pancake you're going to get out of two simple ittle potatoes now we extract the water very therapeutic a potato pop nice and dry that goes in a bowl I'm going to add an equal amount of mashed potato it's a nice match for their leftover magic again a great way of getting rid of it and to this again my flour again one-third one-third one-third roughly and that's the basic for the three types of box-t boiled baked in the pan but today I'm just gonna make the pan box deep in a pinch of salt and to this we're gonna add our milk to make a batter any good batter you're making you need to let it settle for a little while so it comes out of itself the starch is released and it starts to thicken so for this I'm going to use a little bit of butter a little bit of rapeseed oil it's important to cook this on a low heat because the potato was to cook out you've got raw potato in it it's not like a regular pancake the flour will cook out but you need that potato to cook out that's gonna take about five minutes to cook okay so wind up when the pancake dries out on this side as it is now you can see it trying it's trying to flip you got a lovely golden color on your pancake this side bucks to you on the griddle bucks T on the pan you can't make cuts deep never get a man perfect box t better thank you enjoy
