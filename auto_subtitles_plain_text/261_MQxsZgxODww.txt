 hi everyone my name is chef ray alonzi and i'm here at turners yard and i'm going to give you my take on it udon noodle soup it's a classic Asian dish now what who da noodles are are there a got a package right here you can get these in any local grocers you know any of your Asian markets it's a big fat wide noodle it's a big flower noodle so these are great you can do anything you want with them you can use them in any kind of soup today we're going to make a traditional soup and I'm going to add my little twist to it so for the ingredients for the soup I chosen to use two types of mushrooms some udon noodles some carrots some snap peas Sam bamboo shoots some sprouts and a little bok choy we have some broth and we're going to saute all our vegetables in a little sesame oil this is going to give us that nice Asian flavor that I like so I'm going to start off with a little bit of sesame oil get my pan hot I'm going to put in some carrots some mushrooms now I've also chose to use some enoki mushrooms I'm going to save those to the end because those are really really delicate they give it a great flavor and I basically just garnish the soup with it it's a great colorful dish it's it's very very vibrant you can add meat to it you can add pork to it chicken beef it's up to you now since I'm using a chicken stock I'm not going to add salt and pepper to it I'm going to make it a very light brothy soup I've already seized in my broth so I don't feel I need to add any more flavor to it I want to pull the flavors from the vegetables so it's going to give me that nice vegetable flavor now I'm going to have my bok choy I don't want to add too much of it I just want to give it just kind of wilted a little bit I don't want to overcook it so what I've got going on I've get some great great flavors coming off of this oh man all right so now they've got that that cooking and simmering I think my vegetables are pretty much ready for my bra so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take some is vegetable broth that I have I'm gonna let my veggies finish cooking in this broth no it smells awesome so we're going to let that cook we only had simmer for probably about a couple minutes we want to get that nice and hot and then we're going to add on noodles to it so these are the hutong noodles and nice and thick nice i've already precooked them you want to cook them for a couple minutes you don't want to overcook them I like them cook a little bit chewy so we're gonna cook these in here and that smells fantastic okay perfect all right that's perfect just the way I want it now I'm going to finish with those enoki mushrooms I was talking about these beauties are just so small so delicate I don't want to overcook them so I'm going to place them right on the top I'm going to let it stew like that and this will incorporate when you cook them you can eat these mushrooms raw you can cook them you can saute them I chose leave them on top so my name is chef ray Alon G and this is my version of udon noodle soup
