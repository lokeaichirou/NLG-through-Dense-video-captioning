 [Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with falafel that's right falafel is one of those rare foods like french fries and pizza that pretty much everybody loves in fact when i meet someone that doesn't like falafel i have to admit I'm a little suspicious I mean what's not to like about this crispy deep-fried chickpea fritter and well I don't think there's much danger in this video putting your friendly local neighborhood falafel stand out of business this really did come out quite well and I think you're gonna be surprised how easy it is so let's go ahead and get started with the star of the show garbanzo beans also known as chickpeas or is my family called them grown up chichi beans and for the amount I make it I'm gonna use one generous cup of dried garbanzo beans and check them out they have a very cool appearance they look like a little shriveled up let's say brains and what we need to do is soak these before we use them so pro tip if you want to make this today make sure you do this step yesterday alright because what we need to do is cover these in cold water and let them soak at least overnight personally I think 24 hours is better but overnight should be fine so like I said well cover those with a few inches of cold water and we'll put that into place where there's a pretty good chance that won't get knocked over and as long as you've covered those with enough water the next day they should look something like this and then what we'll do at this point is drain those very very well before we transfer that into our food processor and add the rest of the ingredients alright a blender will work sort of ok and yes you can make this by hand by crushing or chopping but that's gonna take significantly longer so try to find a food processor I guarantee one of your married friends has one just borrow it for a day tell me you're gonna make it worth your while with falafel but anyway we're gonna go ahead and dump in our now very well drained beans to which I'm gonna add some diced onion and by the way even though this is gonna get processed I think it mixes more evenly if you start by cutting the onion nice and small first so I'm gonna add in about half an onion along with a whole bunch of minced garlic we're also gonna need a whole bunch of freshly chopped to tell you parsley some people also like to use cilantro here or a combination we're also going to need some salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper we're also going to throw in a spoon of ground cumin or cumin as I believe it's supposed to be pronounced as well as a little bit of ground coriander and then we're gonna shock the world by putting in a little pinch of cayenne as well as a small touch of baking soda no not powder baking and a spoon of flour just a little not too much okay one of the big decisions with a falafel mix is do you want it more bready or more beanie and I prefer beanie so personally I don't want to put too much flour here and then last but not least we're gonna squeeze in a little bit of lemon juice and that's pretty much it and do you need to give it a mix like this before you process it probably not I'm not sure why I did that but it's too late now but anyway once all your ingredients are together we're simply gonna process this pulsing on and off to start of course and what we want to end up with here is something that's pretty finely ground but not a puree all right we don't want to liquefy this or turn it into a really fine paste and with something like this it's always a great idea about halfway through to take a little break take off the lid take a spatula kind of scrape everything down off the sides give it a little mix in case there are any large rogue chunks refusing to get mixed in so I did that and recommend you do the same thing and we'll continue to blitz that until like I said we have a very finely ground mixture and instead of trying to think of a very clever way to describe it let me just show you this is what I think you want all right very finely ground but not pasty so we don't want to go too far but it does have to be ground fine enough to hold a shape because we're gonna form these into balls and or other shapes soon so that's looking good and at this point we can transfer that to a bowl and kind of press it and pack it down and then what we want to do is cover this and let it sit for an hour or two before we start forming our falafel and yes I have done these without letting it rest and it does work but by sticking it in the fridge for an hour - those flavors really are gonna meld together and it's gonna be a little easier to work with which is never a bad thing so I did pop mine in the fridge for a couple hours after which we're ready to shape and I'm just gonna make some small balls I'm gonna use one of these little sorbet scoops which not only gives me the shape I want but it also ensures these are about the same size each and by the way one tip if you moisten your fingers these are a lot easier to work with in fact there's an old saying in the falafel industry damp hands that make smooth balls and it really is true all right so we're gonna form our falafel into the shape of our choice and at that point they're ready to fry so we're gonna cook these in 350 degrees for roughly 5 minutes and of course that times gonna vary with your size and shape but for the ones I did here five minutes was just about perfect and I'm just playing with him here you don't have to do this I was just bored so I gave mister but like I said we're gonna cook those for about five minutes at which point they should look like this beautifully brown and crispy on the outside oh yeah those look done so we'll transfer those onto a rack to cool for minutes and we'll take a bite so you can see that gorgeous inside look at that beautiful color and right here you can get a real good look at that texture inside it shouldn't be too bad it shouldn't be too dry it should have the texture of falafel and as you saw in our last video I serve these with some tahini sauce as a dip which is just a very simple and very beautiful way to serve them and I hear you out there those look amazing but chef Jon I don't have a deep fryer there's no way I could do these well I got some great news you don't need a deep fryer instead of making balls just flatten them out into patties and pan fry them for a couple minutes per side it works beautifully and they really do come out just as gorgeous and as you're about to hear just as crispy and not only does that technique work but if you're gonna toss yours into a PITA to make the traditional falafel sandwich that shape actually works better so I threw a couple in a PITA which I generously swiped with hummus with some diced tomato cucumber and onion and of course finished it with a drizzle of tahini and that my friends for a sandwich that was not invented in America is incredible just one of the all-time great fast foods of the world and I know that's a concept it's hard for a lot of people to grasp healthy delicious and beautiful fast food but anyway that's it I'm gonna go finish the rest of that off and I really hope this demo inspired you to give these a try and what if it doesn't I'm not gonna lie I'll feel awful you know some of these puns just write themselves but seriously I really do hope you give these a try soon so head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you
