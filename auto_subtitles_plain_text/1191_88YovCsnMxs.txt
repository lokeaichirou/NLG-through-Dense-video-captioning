 what's up guys welcome to inspire to cook today I'm going to show you how to make it perfect grilled cheese sandwich it's gonna be cheese delicious and you can easily do it at home let's do it all you're gonna need for this is a little bit of butter cheese of course and I'm gonna use the white bread you can use the bread of your choice of course we need extra pan to fry the flipping things you flip it with and I'm gonna use a little bit of mayonnaise I'm actually gonna use the homemade mean is I'm gonna use the homemade man as we've done in the previous video you can check it out the link in the description and I'm gonna switch it up to medium medium-high all right then I'm gonna grab my cheap pieces of bread and put my mayonnaise on top of it just a little bit and we're gonna apply mayonnaise on one surface of each piece of bread and we're gonna go to him then we're gonna kind of smooth it on butter and throw it on our pan make sure it's hot so it starts melting right away we're gonna give our first piece of bread and put it with the mainland side down on the pin and looking at through about four pieces of cheese on our bread you can put sticks depending on how much you like it and we're gonna cover it up with our other piece of bread with the mayonnaise to make sure you actually keep the heat on medium to medium low when you have the sandwich on the pan as it actually helps the cheese melt proportionally before the bread starts frying too much and I let it fry for a little while until one side of bread actual grew a little bit and get a bit of a collar on the one side the beauty of this recipe is very simple you can do it in any weather you don't have to go outside to really so why not okay once that looks like it's about to be done so we're gonna pick it up and flip it and if you didn't grill it enough a month we can come back to it and Grill it and flip it again so we know that we need to hold it a little bit longer hmm you can smell the cheese delicious sandwich gathers that looks like it's completely ready so I'll flip it then we're going to let it sit for another side to make it as Brahma all right it looks like the thin which is ready we're gonna put in out in let it rest for low and I'm gonna cut it along to make it look a bit nicer and to make it easier to eat waiting in four pieces to make sure it's easy comfortable to you and you keep your cheese is actually all nice and melted she's delicious the bread is crunchy the cheese is nothing hot whoo-hoo I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe try to make this switch at home and let me know in comments below what you think she's out I do
