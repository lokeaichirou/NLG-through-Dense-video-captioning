 today's chef county is gonna teach us how to make shrimp and vegetable tempura so we were gonna focus first I'm making the batter and then we're gonna focus on frying all the fun stuff okay what's the first step so we have wet ingredients dry ingredients I'll mix the drop dry you do the wet you've got an egg you've got ice-cold water I have flour and baking soda so go ahead and get with the whip break up the yolk now there's a lot of schools of thought on the batter some people like to use seltzer water because of the air and it helps make it lighter and that can work at the end of the day of what I have found is this works I like this recipe Cheryl because you can make it and you can let it sit and not have to worry about the there's seltzer water get it slap that's perfect so now we have our wet ingredients here and our dry and you're gonna you're gonna mix while I pour the flour into the egg batter Chuck you want to go dry in too wet for this procedure okay I'm gonna gradually put the flour into the egg water mixture and Cheryl's gonna mix it just so it's lightly incorporated it's okay if it has a little bit of lump so you don't want to over mix it you over mix it that you're gonna have a duck really tough and gummy batter that's perfect perfect so what's gonna happen now is we're gonna take our batter and you you know it's it's it's it's a little it may look like a slightly runny but what's important and a good tip Putte is that you have a light batter because you don't want it to over coat what you're gonna fry so what I want to do now is we're gonna take this item the batter we're gonna put in a refrigerator while we prep all of our ingredients that we're gonna fry and heat the oil and that's important because we've just mixed the flour and flour and water making gluten and if we use it right now it's gonna have a tendency to be tougher so we want the thing to relax a little bit and then we'll be good to go all right so what we've done is we've made our batter and we've let it set in the refrigerator so that it can rest a little bit because we mixed it hard right who's got a doughy right so now we're gonna go ahead and start frying I have very clean oil I'm using canola oil here and we've got it to 320 degrees and we've got some shrimp I have a jumbo shrimp here that we've butterfly and then on the base here because what happens if you don't do this though if you just throw them in they'll curl so along the bottom of I've made the little slits and that will help keep them straight okay then we've got all kinds of vegetables here and the key is to cut like hard vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes you want to cut them thin so that they can cook in the amount of time that it takes to fry the batter mm-hmm the onions broccoli we've got some eggplant and some cheese she saw and we've got shiitake mushrooms started what's this that is Okinawan sweet potato so I'm gonna dip to the shrimp in here I'm gonna just lightly let some of the excess come off and then I'm gonna go ahead and put in my oil I want to wiggle it just a little bit as it kind of goes in there and it'll start to feather out a little bit and then I'll just let it roll what's all the - shrimp in there for now so I just just coated it and just put it right inside there don't shake it too much because you want all the batter to come off a couple more pieces if there's some pieces that take longer to cook so we should put it in first uh it's it's more of a matter of just watching their time so I mean if you put something in that takes longer to cook after it's just yeah keep an eye on the product okay but one thing you do want to do is you want to keep track of your oil you know it's convenient if you have one of those fry daddies it'll keep track of the temperature using a public we're doing here you want to make sure that the oil doesn't get so hot that it's burning a product before it has a chance to cook and you don't want to overcrowd the pan either I think we're kind of good right now and the shrimp will probably take maybe a minute to cook and it's actually looking pretty good here someone put that over here I'll take this right here and then what happened so I'm gonna use my little basket here as you're trying what's important you're gonna want to clean out the oil every so often because little pieces are gonna want they're gonna come off and you're gonna a little and I got some here oh not a bit so you want to put that so we're gonna go ahead and keep frying Cheryl's gonna keep dipping and dropping and I'll keep watching what's gonna happen here and then when we come back you'll get to see all the finished product and then we get to do the part that I like to do it and that's neat sounds great we're right back wow that was really easy so remind us what's the secret to great template ah okay here we go ice cold water really important make sure you don't over mix the batter let it be a little bit lumpy and let it rest for a little bit so that it's not really sort of doughy right make sure your oil is 325 degrees so that you're not gonna have a soggy oily product and eat it as quickly as possible serve them right away because we want it to be hot and you want them to be crisp oh so delicious I mean I was shrimp for this recipe and more visit us at Foodland comm hmm
