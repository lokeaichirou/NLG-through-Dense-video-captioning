 today in the pickled plum kitchen I'm making miso ramen so sharpen your knives heat up your pans and get ready to dig in I couldn't ramen every day and one of my all-time favorites is miso ramen it's super tasty and looks impressive like you slaved over a hot stove for hours but no one has to know how easy it is to toss everything together for a quick lunch at home I'm using Elysee miso which is a mix of red and white miso paste for our broth today so let's get started put a medium sized pot of water on the stove to boil in a separate pot heat up 4 cups of chicken stock then in another bowl add 1/4 cup of OSE miso paste with 2 tablespoons of sake 3 tablespoons of knitting and 1 TSP of sesame oil give it a good whisk and set aside then chopped 2 garlic cloves and peel and finely chopped 1 tablespoon of ginger finely chop about 2 cups of cabbage peel and julienne 1/3 of a cup of carrots and finely chopped 3 scallions now get a medium-sized pan going over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil cook your garlic and ginger for about 1 minute then add your cabbage and carrots and cook for about 2 minutes until the carrots are starting to get tender but be careful not to lose all of the crunch once your water is boiling drop the dry ramen noodles in and cook for a little less time than recommended on the package about 3 minutes we want them on the al dente side because they will continue to cook once they hit the soup drain and set aside then add two tablespoons of your miso today's soup base to each bowl add your noodles and add two cups of chicken broth stir well and top with cabbage and carrots scallions and a boiled egg why not and there it is that wasn't so hard was it now let me take a bite of this beautiful miso ramen mmm oh yes holy sheep for more recipes like this one check out pickle plum calm
