 hi everybody and welcome back to Dave's kitchen today in this episode we're making up some chicken curry which is a dish really popular in many parts of Southeast Asia in India it contains some of the ingredients that I really love such as curry ginger coconut milk etc it's relatively easy to make I know you're going to love it so let's get started what I have here is some boneless skinless chicken breast you can use just about any cut you want I just find these are a little bit healthier and I'm just going to cut these into cubes the size is really entirely up to you but this is about the size I like next I'm going to add some cooking oil to a preheated pan add the onions in followed by the ginger the garlic and I'm just going to stir and saute these for a minute or two just until the onions begin to turn translucent and everything becomes fragrant now what I'm going to do is add in the chicken and I'm going to stir and fry up for about six to seven minutes just until it begins to turn light brown now the chicken is light brown we're going to add in the curry powder the hot pepper flakes some salt a dusting of freshly ground pepper the freshly chopped tomatoes and I'm just going to stir and fry this until the chicken is nicely coated with the curry and the tomatoes have begun to turn soft and wilt a little bit now what I'm going to do is add in the coconut milk if you want it a little bit healthier you can always use yogurt but I love the taste of coconut milk and of course we're going to give this a slight stir bring it to a boil and we're just going to slip a lid over this and let it simmer over medium low heat for about thirty minutes after 30 minutes the chicken is fully cooked so we're going to add in the cilantro and some lemon juice to balance out the taste at this point in time you can give it a taste test and add any additional spices that you feel it needs and believe me the smell of curry is filled the air and it smells absolutely incredible and you're ready to serve and here it is our delicious chicken curry one of my all-time favorites serve this up over some hot rice or bread for more details on this recipe visit our website and if you have something you'd like to share leave us a comment thanks for watching and see you next time you
