 hi guys today we're going to make some easy oven fried chicken this is like my third time reporting this video I keep deleting parts and just oh it's a nightmare but anyway wash and dry your chicken okay the next we're just going to add some seasoning mix you can go to my blog and get all the measurements as always I have like some seasonings saw some poultry seasoning Cajun seasonings all kinds of little spices in there go ahead and pour excuse me half the mixture on the chicken okay not all of it just half the seasoning mixture on the chicken and then use your hands to kind of you know distribute the seasonings just like that mix it up and I almost forgot the paprika oops gonna put some in there I don't put the paprika in my flour mixture because it can kind of make your chicken like really dark so I only put the paprika on the chicken itself and there you have it alright now I'm going to add the flour to a separate Bowl and we're going to add the rest of that seasoning mixture the other half of the seasoning mixture give that a whisk get it all combined okay set that aside now in a small bowl I'm going to add an egg and some milk alright then I'm going to add a few dashes of hot sauce I like a little hot sauce yeah so yeah that's optional and give it a whisk to combine what's good what's good okay now it's time to get started with the dipping I have my flour right here I got a little egg mixture right here and I have a plate to put the chicken on when it has been breaded okay so let's get started you're going to start by dipping that seasoned chicken in the egg roll it around get it coated in that egg mixture let the excess drip off and then put it right there in the flour then use your other hand to kind of coat the chicken and that way the flour won't get so clumpy and then just shake off the excess flour and just place it on a plate or a rack or ever okay now the chicken has been coated we're going to let it sit for about five minutes and then I'm going to dip it back in the flour I want to double coat these okay don't put it back in the egg mixture just put it back in that flour mixture because you should have some left over okay and now I'm going to prepare my thumb my pan I have a baking sheet I cover it in foil now just place a little rack on top of it and I have some vegetable oil here I'm just gonna make sure that this rack is thoroughly greased because this chicken can get really you know it'll stick to the rack if it's not thoroughly hungries alright there's our chicken it's gonna place this on the rack just like that okay now I have a mixture of butter and olive oil I'm just going to mom you can brush this on the chicken you can just spoon it over the chicken this just helps it form a nice crunchy crisp crust on it okay never going to bake for 40 minutes I like to brawl the last three to four minutes just to get the skin nice and crispy and then when it comes out the oven let it sit for a bit in vent enjoy thanks for watching guys buh-bye
