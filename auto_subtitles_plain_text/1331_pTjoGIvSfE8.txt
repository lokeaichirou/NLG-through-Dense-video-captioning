 hi welcome to Mary cooks would you believe I've been researching for over an hour and a half one particular recipe that I want to do today and this is a recipe that my mother taught me and my family all does is traditional recipe in our family it's pasta fagioli which means beings and pasta pasta beings and the Italian way of saying it is pasta fagioli I got on the Internet I've got all my my favorite cookbooks and I've been researching different recipes for pasta fagioli and you wouldn't believe how many recipes there are how many versions of this particular dish so today what I like to do is I like to show you my mother's version of pasta fagioli so let's get into the kitchen and let's get this recipe takes few ingredients in fact it's a very inexpensive meal to make for the family very economical I think in these times I'd say probably it takes maybe about five ingredients the main ingredients naturally the two main ingredients are going to be our beans and our pasta and the beans we're going to use our canna lily beans a white kidney bean and the pasta is a tiny little too tight pasta called Italy me so that's a posture and that's a beans then the other ingredients are crushed tomatoes parsley basil and Italian you always need your garlic salt and pepper and our seasoning will be dry oregano dried basil and if you notice I buy large size basil and oregano since I use those so much of my cooking and that's another economical way of saving money by as much as I do well we're going to do first we're going to drain the beans and let me explain something about the beans this is one size can this is twenty nine point five ounce can this is another size can buy another company and this is 15.5 ounces if you use the 15.5 ounces only two cans I'm just using one can of the twenty nine point five ounces so we want to drain the beans and we want to also rinse them there's a lot of salt on the beans rain let that sit on the side we're not gonna use those until much later I'm going to go ahead and start chopping up my spices and we'll get back to you in a second maybe I should put my glasses on when I'm giving you some measurements and sizes I made a mistake this guy scan is 19 ounces and it was until after I drain them did I realize that's not going to be enough beans so I would say 2 cans this side would be what you would want since I only have this 15.5 I'm gonna use that but I would recommend pound three ounces two cans of those let's start now making our sauce so first we're going to coat the bottom of our sauce pan with some olive oil I'd say probably that's a tablespoon of olive oil let that get hot and I have that on ium hi going to add two cloves of garlic which have been minced if the fragrance is coming out two cans of crushed Italian Tomatoes and I found this particular brand on sale whenever I see Italian Tomatoes whole Tomatoes of crushed tomatoes on sale I stock up so this is my first time using this particular brand but it's crushed Italian Tomatoes these are 28 ounce cans our salt coarse sea salt sometimes I'll use black pepper oregano and dried basil two tablespoons of chopped parsley Italian parsley flat leaf parsley and two tablespoons of fresh chopped basil mix that through well get the pot the sauce to start coming to a boil and once it does turn it down to low and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes we want the spices to blend in with the tomato sauce so 15 to 20 minutes should do a good job of blending the red crushed red pepper to this if you like or chopped jalapeno pepper if you like your sauce while this is simmering simmer 15 to 20 minutes we stop my water boiling before my pasta that's the digital mini pasta this is a one-pound box I'm going to use half of this so we're going to use half a pound of ditalini pasta that we'll add to the sauce when it's ready during an antigen tomato sauce that's half a pound it's really neat children love that shape pasta and now we're going to add the white kidney beans the beans are cooked and the pastas cooked so all we're going to do is just incorporate all of the flavorings together some pasta fagioli is very thin it's very soupy this is where this one is different this is more like a stupid you know Harry Caray says stupid for soup and a stew this is more of a stew consistency see there that's not very stupid it's delicious now we're gonna let this cook simmered I'd say or cook it on low for about another 10 minutes to cooperate all of those seasonings into the beans and the pasta and then we'll be ready to soak for about 10 minutes and it's ready now as you can see it's thicker than a soup but it's still running with the tomatoes I like to serve it with some grated Parmesan cheese and crusty Italian roll nice crusty Italian roll pasta fagioli Bon Appetit enjoy
