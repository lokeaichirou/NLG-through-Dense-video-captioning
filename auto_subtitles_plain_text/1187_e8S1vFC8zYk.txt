 hi guys today on Davis can cook we are making southern baked macaroni and cheese this recipe is very similar to the one I made on the Nate Berkus show and it is one of my favorite so let's get started okay first you want to start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil then we're gonna throw in that macaroni and cook it until it's al dente I usually cook like a minute below else and say okay so check the back of your box okay all right now we're gonna grease up our casserole dish with some butter now I have drained that pasta so I'm going to go ahead and add it to my casserole dish in a large bowl I'm gonna add in some heavy cream I'm gonna add in some milk and then we're going to add in my cheese's I'm using a sharp cheddar I got some Monterey Kobe Jack there and I have some Velveeta as well go ahead and throw that into the milk mixture and now just stir it up just like that okay now add in some salt and pepper and just stir it in that salt and pepper you can also add in some onion powder and paprika whatever now you want to taste it make sure you taste it this is very important you want it to taste really really good I cannot tell how many times I've had boring macaroni and cheese taste it and get it just right when you have it just right go ahead and throw in those eggs okay go ahead and stir that on in there like that all right okay so now it's gonna pour this mixture on top of the cooked pasta and I guess you can dump this all in a bowl and then just you know pour it in there I do things backwards sometimes I don't know why okay fine no one's gonna make sure that everything is nice and even and covered up just like so and now when I'm content with it I'm gonna sprinkle on that smoked cheddar do not forget this smoked cheddar you guys it really adds that pop it makes it unique and they get a lot of compliments okay so go ahead and add that smoked cheddar on there I'm also gonna put on some more of that Colby Monterey Jack as well okay I'm gonna pop it into the oven and bake it for about 35 minutes and then out come this beauty right here I love how that cheese at top cheese has kind of made like a crust oh my gosh so good but you want to let this sit for about ten minutes before you go digging into it so that it has time to set up and then you are done it is so good I hope you guys enjoyed this video you can get the recipe XD what's been cooked calm bye you
