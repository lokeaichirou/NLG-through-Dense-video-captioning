 benvenuti amici my name is Isabella motor Jetta vacati and I am your personal chef today because I'm going to teach you how to make a wonderful penne pasta with spicy vodka tomato and cream sauce so let's get started the very first thing of course we want to do while we're preparing the sauce is put the water in to boil and of course to cook rather we have a beautiful pot of rolling boiling water right here now remember whenever you put your pasta in the water the one tip I'm going to give you if that water doesn't taste like the ocean you're doing your pasta and injustice or remember you only get one shot guys to make that pasta taste like it wants to be so let's stir that up what we're gonna do is we're going to heat up our saute pan and I'm gonna cut up some pancetta now punch at is like an Italian bacon you need about a quarter pound you noticed I have this actually sliced and there's no rhyme or reason on how it has to be alright whatever is easier for you if you want to separate it because it's easier for you to do it that way by all means we're gonna put this bunch etta in the saute pan very shortly as a matter of fact let's get that butter in you want two tablespoons of butter here's one and two now we need the olive oil because the olive oil is in the keeps of butter from burning so let me just melt that down perfect and I'm gonna throw the punch it in right now it's got a little more to go okay perfect you want to lower that a little bit because you don't want to burn it because you want to cook this but you want it nice and crispy while I'm here let's make sure you stir that pasta remember no mushy pasta and my Kachina or yours for that matter okay as I have this nice and low I'm gonna leave this here alright let's chop some onions as the bunch hit that is cooking getting it nice and crisp you want to take an onion I had a really large onion and I didn't need that whole thing so I just cut it in half and all we're gonna do is we're just going to chop it that doesn't have to be so fine you're gonna learn in my style of cooking that cooking is not scientific at all I don't get myself crazy on how big the pieces are they don't have to be exact I just want them in there and they're almost the same there you go you notice I got this another piece that I need to let go so I'm gonna leave this right here notice I also have my fresh tomato sauce that I made earlier I have some wonderful parsley because we're gonna need that so you know what well that pancetta is cooking let's take a nice handful of fresh parsley and let's chop that up too you know how I feel about herbs by the way you know I always teach you a word or two in Italian so I'm gonna teach you how to say parsley and parsley in the tightest bread semolo I'm gonna say it one more time Bret Sam Malone thank you so here we go we got our parsley we have our onions chopped that pancetta is ready and we're gonna add the wonderful chopped onions that we just took care of cheapo a lie that's how you say onions cheap Ola all right smells heavenly I love the smell of fun Chester Oh fabulous it's nice and crispy and it has that wonderful saltiness to it let's get my herbs over I want my fresh tomato sauce and my frets mmm Allah remember how I taught you how to say that in Italian I'm gonna leave it right here perfect now well where's the vodka right here my friends right here let's put it in right now don't you love that sound we're gonna throw that in we're gonna throw the fresh tomato sauce in ah doesn't this look beautiful do you notice that it takes no time at all to make these dishes and of course we're gonna need the cream but not just yet now I know that pastas ready I'm gonna turn this off we're gonna drain it okay we're gonna drain this pasta right now now while we're draining don't forget to put about a cup of the reserved pasta water aside because you never know when you're gonna need it to stretch that sauce just a little bit okay I'm gonna leave it right here pot a moment now what are we doing we added the sea vodka we added the fresh tomatoes and we're gonna add the cream now now I like using half-and-half many people use heavy cream I prefer to make this as healthy as possible so I'm gonna use the half-and-half what else am I gonna do I'm gonna add these beautiful herbs in toss that in and last but not least I'm going to taste this before we throw this pasta in can you see how beautiful this looks ah this looks gorgeous why don't never years my Nona would say that is simply dill it's your song but you know what I like a kick we're gonna throw a little more red pepper in this baby we're gonna stir it up and now we're gonna take that pasta and take it and toss it right in just like this now let me tell you a restaurant trick you never ever ever sauce the pasta in the bowl that you're serving it in you always want to sauce the pasta right here in the pan because what you want to do is you want these flavors to marry you want them to just come together and you're gonna see what happens if you let this simmer just for a few moments it'll be perfect all right here we go I want you to see this gorgeous gorgeous spicy penne pasta you're gonna love it with vodka and pancetta and herbs and a touch of cream you notice that it's not heavy at all watch this to me this is a fabulous dish and how long did it take not very long at all the only thing I would do is add a little bit of Romano cheese okay a little more cuz I like my Romano and of course I'm gonna taste it one more time and I want you to see hmm that's amazing your family's gonna want us for dinner remember chef Isabella Isabella Villa Cucina benvenuti in vivid abenney amici livewell my friends and buon appetito ciao you
