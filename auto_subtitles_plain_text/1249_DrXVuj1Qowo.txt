 [Music] hi welcome to show me the curry calm I'm hit I'm Anuja and today we're making chana masala and this is a recipe shared with us by my brother-in-law and doesn't that's a job with it and my sister refuses to learn how to make it because she knows he'll stop making it and now she won't have a choice after this video ideas what you need 2 cups of China or garbanzo beans soaked in 8 cups of water 1 bay leaf 1 black cardamom and a 2-inch piece of cinnamon salt to taste one and a half tablespoons oil 1/8 TSP asafoetida one 14.5 ounce can of crushed tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon each of chat masala red chilli powder an R Donna powder and dried mango powder 1 tbsp China or chole masala 2 teabags sliced onions and green chillies optional for garnishing so for our chana masala recipe we have a pressure cooker going on high heat right now and we've added our China into there using the same water that it was soaked in so that's in there and to this we're gonna add in the bay leaf black cardamom cinnamon stick teabags and salt we're gonna give it a mix now teabags for those who have not used tea bags and her in cooking it gives a really nice rich dark color to the Jenna right so we've you can do once the bread pressure builds up we're gonna let it whistle 2 or 3 times lower the heat and let it cook for about 20 minutes alright the pressure cooker channels are done in the pressure cooker that's how look yeah the teabags really no help so what we're gonna do now is just take out the tea bags cuz you don't want to eat those and we have a bowl and just something to scoop out the general we're going to separate the China from the liquid that they're in and don't throw away the liquid because we are going to use it it's a good way to tell if your China is cooked properly is that you'll notice there's cracks and if it's crack you know that it's gonna be soft on the inside and you know people have different preferences some people really like the China you know too old shape some people like them all mash down so it's up to you if you like you know overly cooked it up and just keep the pressure cooker going on for a little bit longer but this is perfect for us because it's still gonna hold shape and it's cracking so we know it's perfectly cooked and over here we have a medium sized skillet and put it on medium heat actually medium to a little higher than medium and you're gonna put in the oil ok once the oil is hot add in heat and quickly add in the tomatoes and mix and we've used the canned tomatoes they have a really nice color and actually has it you know a lot of nutrients packed in there but if you want to use fresh tomatoes that's always a great option awesome and we're gonna allow this to cook and basically the oil needs to separate from the tomatoes so we're gonna keep it on a little medium high but keep an eye on it tomatoes first well then burn fast and seconder for that will slime out over so we have our yes so you're gonna do that and we'll see you back so we ended up covering our Tomatoes they were splattering all over the place but their eclipses can see the oil is coming out from the sides and the perfect indication that the tomatoes are ready looks good you're gonna add in the dry spices now [Music] brightening the water and a la donna when Ivana has actually pomegranate ease so that has really nice tangy flavor and at that really like a new dimension to this case we've used a store-bought channa masala and you can buy any brand and just either just all the wonderful difference that wasn't a very good right channels through goodness and now how are we gonna do this we say that water from the tuna the street boils and we will keep adding that little at the time and then let it just keep cooking so little by little this liquidus if you get absorbed by the china and it's going to make them really flavorful so while that's cooking we're going to cover it one more time and it'll help all the flavors incorporate really well alright let's have a look yeah I've actually been stirring it in the middle so it doesn't burn I'll dry it up nicely and what I'm gonna do is just take the end of your spatula I just press it in a little bit so that you know everything just incorporates well and China actually absorbs a little bit of the masala and there's a little bit it forms a pinkish gravy a little bottom line is bigger than repeat this process till all the liquid is gone and we reach the desired consistency here and this recipe of course it's it's a drier version so it's not very great line right so but the key is that as the liquid gets evaporated it just concentrates the flavor and it's so good looks very good yes the color is awesome and you're gonna stop at this point fell over a little time and you get a little drier but the channels will keep absorbing the liquid and you know so even after I turn it off if you drive a little bit more keep it like this and when you serve this you can have some sliced onions or green chillies and even some cilantro or coriander leaves and just garnish the top of it yes and also this same recipe can be used for if you're having samosa jot or Dickey chart you know just take a Tiki and put some on this and fantastic so thank you North Korea for this recipe like you said in your email I thank you and I bless you that's what you wanted one suggesting this is a fantastic recipe yes so join us again on another sort of show me the car you don't comp adding a pinch of spice to it [Music]
