 everyone in our family loves pierogi especially when my mother who was always known as big Martha in the family made them and I work closely by her side writing down her recipes so we would have them forever and this is grandma's recipe it works beautifully it is soft it is tender she rolled it out thinly she didn't make the puree too big she only had one kind of cutter so we're gonna start with the one large egg you can just whisk so all right and then to enter the one large egg few tablespoons sour cream so it's not a lot it's just a little bit but it makes a difference there are some very nice froggy places will go there some night with your new boyfriend can I mention no no oh god I always plan so 1 cup of water 1 cup of whole milk and I'm just gonna keep listening yeah and I can let your air we just want it mixed well but not a lot of bubbles and then flower Cup by Kaka Roger gonna take this out is it now you use it wooden spoon all right course and then just let never get lettuce in first and this makes a wet sticky dough that um that has to be needed for quite a while okay the next cup can go in and did I mention it's 5 cups of all-purpose flour see how nice the dough is but you okay no it's one of us has to do the kneading so why don't you do that put your put a lot of flour on your hands and use the bunch scraper like grandma did you she lifts with the bench scraper and pushes with the heel of the left hand yeah left handle a yeah the only one hand cuz you have to save one hand for the telephone here and so now we'll take this span start to roll it out so here I'll give you an eighth rapid than words so put some dough flour down here not on the crack here and you want to get it to be Oh somewhere less than an eighth of an inch thick okay thank you don't press hard and this is a rolling pin so it's not a prissy got it not going and this is a ball bearing pin that's why I gave you a ball bearing because it's not oppressing it's rolling see how nicely it rolls when you don't press too hard not addressing anymore good now don't waste any dough as close to the edge as possible and they cut perfect rounds and do a little twist yeah twist really hard okay see how nicely it cuts it we always had so much fun doing this next step making the I call it the sweet cabbage filling which is my favorite and you take real cabbage my mom would go to the store and ask for the old cabbages that are dried out kind of desiccated and then she would steam them in wedges like this and just on a rack and a big pot and then the hard work started this is hard on a board wedged into the sink like this you would wrap the dough so now you squeeze here just squeeze really tight you're going to get every speck of water out of it oh my god key and that's why if he's a strong muslin cloth or or cheesecloth see how you'll see how much water comes out of that and then you push it on the board - yeah this it uses elbow grease and okay so give me a piece of cabbage so I can as if it's too wet unfortunately it just doesn't work that well so here that if here is this little little piece of look at this shriveled up steamed cabbage the meat chopper actually chops it up so now you push this through then chopper they're spitting cabbage at you it comes out a nice little pieces now whoever devised this I will never know now this is a half a stick of butter okay and then look at this even supreme cheese have to be in there uh and you think that that's rich but you see how small these dumplings are just just so small little goes a long yes and you can eat 20 of them with no difficulty my happier guys used to have contests on who could eat them oh yeah and uh I did win sometime that's terrible than admit lots of black pepper very important to have black pepper but see how this is not wet yeah okay it's very important that this filling not be wet and salt lots of salt Wow there well that's a teaspoon yeah and seasoning is important because there's nothing here except dough and cabbage so so now we have water boiling also if you're gonna make these right away here kind of use your hey and I use mine and we're going to now use use flour on your fingers just to make sure that they're not gonna stick to the dough and I had these covered with cloth it's very important not to let the dough dry out and just get all the flour off stretch the dough a little bit not too much but just a little and then Vanessa just an innocent yeah and she asked little spoon you don't want too much filling but you don't want too little so a small teaspoon like this is good then you just did you tell grandma was doing it in the picture so yeah you don't say that's not God I've never mastered that is exactly as hers but but you pull these edges exactly together let me sing oh you're fast yeah are these no I'm putting on a cloth with a little bit of um so we have some already made the girls were practicing before we went on yes okay that's good yeah but you know why do they work salted water make sure it's salted and we're just gonna drop these in and they're done I'm putting yours in okay perfect and don't put mine in and Sophie's and you wait and stir but if you stir these don't stir with something like this stir with the back of a wooden spoons a handle just to keep them you don't want to break them at all these are all little tricks that grandmas on me look floating look how beautiful mmm so they float for about a minute and then you take them out yes let them cook because you do not want the dough to be undercooked okay so these are done now don't just put the pierogies on a bare plate always the front aground off put a little melted butter on the plate and you know let it let it go all over the plate and then you put the hot gorgeous pierogies mmm well drain on the plate we're going to go into the kitchen and eat all of these during intermission with a little bit of melted butter there to me to hope you'll see all those up in here
