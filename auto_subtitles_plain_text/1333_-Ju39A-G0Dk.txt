 okay Jax kalpana here you're cooking with jack on part two of my mom is great series this is something my mom made it's very inexpensive a lot of you may be out of work just trying to make the dollar stretch the end of the month whatever it is this has a lot of flavor very inexpensive cost maybe five dollars to make the whole thing and you'll have tons of it so and there's variations so if you don't like what i do you can throw some extra in i'll show you what those are as we go along okay all you need to get started the very basic recipe here's one can of kidney beans the red kidney beans one thing of tomato puree and one pound of elbow macaroni and see this here this is my mom's original spaghetti pot that's right it's got all the dings all the scratch marks there's my mom's pot and I saw the lid for it too which is all dented but it always stays better when it's in mom's pot okay so let's take a look here we're gonna bring you into the stove we're just gonna show you how to put this together if you had pasta fazool before you will know like at Olive Garden they put ground pork in it or ground beef in it you can make different variations I have no meat in this recipe for you vegetarians out there they don't want meat or can't have it or you're allergic to it or whatever it is so you can add meat to this not a problem it'll be just as good even more delicious more flavor you know with the kidney beans first thing to go in you want all the juice and everything okay so just pour the kidney beans in there there you go if you like kidney beans you put a second can in you want to throw white beans in there go ahead that's where you can make your variations I have the light red beans do whatever you want okay then you're just gonna take this over the sink and rinse it out not a full can of water but just kind of swish it around to get all that flavor out of the can here we go don't forget the recipes down below so you know what to write this down we're gonna pour the puree in then we're gonna start filling up the cans of water okay we're gonna put in a few cans of water once again check below for the amount of water but we're gonna get all that goodness out of there and we're gonna add some water to the soup all right once again here's your variation I put in five cans of water cuz that's with the recipe asks for and I'm used to that if you like it stronger leave one of the cans of water out okay makes it thicker soup and much more flavor okay now it's time to put in some oregano and when I always do always tap it tap the side you don't glop too much you're looking at about one to one and a half to two tablespoons and there's the basil there we go now here's the key this is another another interesting part of my mom's soup she didn't put a lot of salt in she just put a little bit in she always told us you're gonna have to salt it at the table so this will need salt but just put a little bit of salt in there just to bring up the flavors but I promise you at the table you won't want to add salt and just a little black pepper there you go I got the wet garlic so I'm gonna do two heaping tablespoons because we're Italian whoops sorry about that there we go beautiful get all the garlic off the spoon - this is a fresh ingredient I like to put in my mom used to do dried dried minced onions but I'm just doing fresh so be sure to put in some onions - into the end of the batch okay and then just let that simmer you're gonna if that simmer like a soup so once it starts bubbling and boiling all the flavors get together you should be good to go The Onion's will soften up while you're waiting for it to simmer get this going let's get the macaroni cook cuz this ain't gonna take long macaroni is probably taking longer so get that water boiling and let's get the elbow macaroni cook - okay first thing we're gonna do we got the macaroni all cooked I'm gonna put some of the macaroni in the bowl then you steal some of the soup with a big ladle now you can cook this down a little bit more if you want a thicker but I'm making it how mom made it tastes amazing you got a taste in make sure there's any doesn t any salt or pepper may need a little bit more salt but one of the things we did is kids little Tabasco he that's right Tabasco sauce is amazing oh my goodness I feel like I'm ten years old again this is an amazing comfort food once again it's inexpensive on plate home I want to get a clean e-beam right there there we go it's really good if you like it thicker I would add paste or just cook it down longer I like it a little soupy so it's really good mm-hmm mmm oh yeah that Tabasco just comes right out it's really good bread and butter I even sprinkle cheese on top melts and cheese on top it's awesome now don't forget next week's our big episode that's right it's my short rib marinade excuse me it's my mom's sort of marinade recipe not suppose to give it away but I'm giving away the formula I was gonna bottle this but you know what in celebration of how great my mom is I'm giving you our marinade recipe been doing it for years mm-hmm all right be ready next week's gonna be exciting I'll see on the next cooking with Jack take care I'll see on the next Jack on the go it's gonna be awesome I can't wait Wow I feel like I'm 10 years old again except I wasn't holding it burning my hand sorry sorry everybody oh we're filming oh sorry hey how are ya Jack Scott finding here you're cooking with Jack on the mama mama-mama ma-ma-ma-ma-ma oh mama mom all giddy up elvira shut up you
