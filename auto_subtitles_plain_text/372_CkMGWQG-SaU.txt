 hello and welcome to my kitchen I am chef Diane DiMeo and today I am making a bond me sandwich which basically is a Vietnamese style sandwich first I'm going to get my chicken out and as I always say safety is your best friend gloves on chicken out I like to use by the way chicken thighs why because chicken thighs retain a lot of moisture and it's nice and yummy whereas chicken breasts they dry out too chicken thigh skin this bonus the best after I get my chicken in there and want to get lots of lots of garlic always garlic rocks your breath might not fit sure does taste good when it's going in another garlic in here so we're doing about two garlic cloves a tad bit of sesame seed oil when I say tad bit I mean about two tablespoons we will use my fish sauce which is missing about three dashes which is about I don't know one and a half tablespoons and that's it a little salt Matt one teaspoon salt give it a good mix and now we're just gonna set it aside to let it marinate generally speaking you want to let meats marinate for about I'd say minimum a half an hour make sure it's in the refrigerator so it doesn't get any food poisoning or you don't get sick good next we're moving on to carrots but the secrets I like about making some type of pickled carrot or carrot salad is I always use a vegetable peeler I get nice shavings and if I get it into the bowl we're actually gonna do something there you go they don't need much because we're really just making one sandwich watch how easy this is I mean seriously a little bit of rice wine vinegar give it a little dabble to give it that nice paste and salt that's it set that aside let it rest I already have my cilantro it's been washed I always keep my herbs after I wash them in a wet paper towel and I put it in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator they can stay there for about two weeks always make sure you keep changing out the wet paper towel fresh cilantro leaves I'm not fussy I like my stems stems are super tasty I can really can't stand when they sit then they pick the leaves off which is you leaves no cilantro is delicious when you use the whole piece let's get cooking now and get that chicken on the stove so I've got my pan nice and hot I like using a iron skillet because it really chars the meat and a little stupid that I have even though meat will caramelize by itself I've just top it off a little bit of sugar so it kind of seals in the juices and then it gets really nice and crispy and brown on the outside so a little oil in there this pan is hot it's already smoking you don't want to waste time and I don't want to live in the fire look at the nice carmelization of going on the districting that sugar really adds to it don't be afraid of the fire at home you always want to make sure the flame is nice and hot scaring is good this is about ready here we go bread you can use any bread that you want brioche sandwich roll I prefer to use French bread or Italian bread so I use this and sometimes if I need to crisp it up I just put in the oven it's very simple we're gonna go here very carefully cut it open the first thing I like to do with my sandwich is make sure that you kind of fold it open so it looks like a we're a little butterfly put it down I'm gonna get a slather on one end of it a beautiful sriracha mayo I like a lot I'm gonna put enough next I'm gonna get my beautiful chicken liver pate mmm the other side of that bad boy then I will layer some chicken on the inside of that nice couple of pieces put it on a nice bias which actually just means diagonally and start to load it in I just want to eat this all right now it smells so good pal then fresh sprigs of cilantro going right in there some facing that way some facing this way and of course top it off with my pickled carrots now that's the sandwich close it up smush it in there we go get it onto my plate as always garnished gauger scars aesthetics come first and then the taste we love kimchi and kimchi loves us we're
