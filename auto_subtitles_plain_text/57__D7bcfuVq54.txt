 my name is Simon Stiga and today we gonna make vina schnitzel and we use our pork cutlets each one has about maybe two and a half to three ounces it's thin slices and we pound a little bit to make a nice and tender so we put a little bit salt on it season it a little bit of black pepper and turn first one we put in the flour with that just a stirred a little bit then we put it in the egg wash and then we put it in bread crumbs what we use here in a restaurant we use the Japanese bread crumbs what makes the bean a little bit more case B on the pork then the second one we do the same thing which was put in the flour toss a little bit put it in the egg wash just let me explain a little bit and turn in the black clubs just push it in a little bit so the red comes to nice and firm on the meat and the next step which is gonna saute it off or pan fry it in vegetable oil or olive oil and this one is a favored dish in Austria we call it Wiener schnitzel and it's served in most restaurants or every home at least once a week for the family so it's a very quick meal it takes only a couple minutes a cook on each side to prepare a couple minutes so in 5-10 minutes when you have everything ready to go you can have your lunch or your dinner ready to go so you don't have to stay all day in the kitchen ok and that's it that's I did to go for thousands of how-to and advice videos on any topic visit monkey-see calm
