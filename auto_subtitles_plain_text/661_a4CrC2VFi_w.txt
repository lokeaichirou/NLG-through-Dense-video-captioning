 Swee laddle a Caroline I&amp;S min welcome to my cooking show from middle-earth yesterday I'd love to teach you one of my favorite recipes from the Shires a classic shepherd's pie to start with get yourself a saucepan we're gonna put that on to heat a little bit of oil up in a saucepan this is a really nice simple recipe and this was my dad's favorite so this dish always reminds me of home now I'm gonna put my chopped onions into the saucepan cook onions until they go lovely and soft add your minced lamb now brown this off now you can add your carrots little dollop of tomato puree some Lea &amp; Perrins give that all good stir together now pour your beef stock in after the stock leave it to simmer simmer down for about half an hour should be good and if you haven't already get yourself some mashed potatoes because you're going to need that to put on the top of your pie season you want some pepper in there a little bit of pepper into salt after it's been simmering for half an hour you'll see that the liquid does start to reduce down and go a little bit thicker but my secret tip is I actually put a little bit of some visto powder in I kind of cheat because I like to have a really nice thick like gravy sauce in the meat so I'm just gonna sprinkle a bit of this on and mix this in once your mints has cooked take it off the heat I'm going to pour it into an ovenproof dish now all you need to do is top it with some mashed potatoes now you can either just dollop it on and to smooth it down with a fork or because this shows a special show and I'm very happy to be doing this for geek week I'm using a piping bag okay so we've got a bit more of a fancy occasion then you can use a piping bag and just literally pipe on some rosettes I'm going to do this keep going until you've covered the whole pie fit up all those gaps this is bit optional but I'm gonna sprinkle mine with some grated cheese cuz I like to have a bit of a cheesy topping on there YUM now this is ready to go straight into the oven I will put all the details of the recipe all the quantities oven temperatures everything up on my website so just click the link and you can have the full recipe now this is gonna go into the oven for about another 25 to 30 minutes until all the cheese is melted and the potatoes are nice and crispy on top there we go shepherd's pie is done so I would serve this with some peas I've got to have peas from heaven shepherd's pie it's breaking now serve some up yum yum and to go with that look at a few peas well I hope you all really enjoy the shepherd's pie recipe if you haven't subscribed hit subscribe because I do new recipes every single week and if you have any other requests that you would like me to do then do let me know I love hearing from you guys so until next time I hope you've enjoyed this geek week series I almost definitely have and I will be seeing you very soon knob ear all over that with farewell farewell my friends until next time now I can eat some shelf life mmm-hmm I make a mean shepherd's pie what can I say down
