 now a traditional Irish box my grandmother's favorite treat food it was like eating she spoke to her cousin's house and they'd spend the evening making box tea and gossiping and stuff like that the absolute die-hard traditional recipe is just made with raw potato and I'm a little bit of a diehard I do prefer my box you just made with raw potato but the fashion now is to use yesterday's leftover leftover spots as well so I am going to throw a few of them in because it is a good way of using up leftovers and we're all looking for that at the moment so it's so easy and your fingers that are you missing a mail and I looked down and I closed it with supplemental speed so that can happen too so that'll do with a bit of potato now what you want to do is you want to take all the starchy as much of a starchy moisture out of this as you can and then you can replace that starchy moisture with a little bit of milk or a little bit of egg put a bit of bacon to find it as well actually this what this isn't too bad this mixture you can put it into into a clean tea cloth and really squeeze it out but I find that usually you can just do it with your hands if you have good strong Irish hands as I do they're small but they're strong so you've got your dry potato man and to that I would just add whatever you've got left over in the saucepan problem yesterday you really you don't want to have more than half and half really famous so there's just a bit of a and you just set up now am I gonna add into this now I'm gonna put the pan on actually because you do want a really good hot pan but you don't want any cut anything kind of namby-pamby going on with that pop music a bit of heat going so you just mix that up you need to put in a good scalp of salt to taste it's nothing worse in the blind spot salt and then flour the plain flour God have I run out here it won't kill us as well and then you're just gonna mix that up with a bit of milk or you know what would have leftover yogurt if you've got it as well to do the trick so you just want it and you want it good and wet you want this basically these are potato pancakes so you want it to be the same consistency as a pancake and in the spirit of pancakes I like to throw in an egg and here's my reasons for this as well it was an expression in my grandmother's day to over egg the pudding and what it basically meant was to make a food too rich but it was also kind of used an expression for showing off the bit because eggs as a protein worked they're certainly going to rare commodity but you wouldn't you know you wouldn't be throwing eggs into things willy nearly either you know they were a source of protein and they were a serious food so you'd be careful about how many eggs you put into a cake and you put the majority of your eggs now into a rich cake a Christmas cake and we don't we don't have to think about those things anymore you know we think you know what we have a different kind of poverty now but in those days you know poverty was not having enough eggs so I do like to put I do like to put a little extra egg into things and think of my grandmother she liked to buy too much stick it up the Reagan you know enjoy yourself you like a little right that looks a little bit be a little bit wet again you know it's really just about look see you know it's a pancake mix I just kind of look see and you know what you put this in the pan is that pan smoking yet you put this in the pan and if it doesn't work you make a small bit and then if it doesn't work you just try again now normally I don't do this I don't normally five points in butter because it doesn't usually work for me but we're checking that that pan is smoking off and it is I do like I have to say the old traditional your traditional cast-iron pan now that's smoking I hope this isn't going to be too much of a disaster be a bit embarrassing if it is now there's your box t it's a nice little hand okay cuz if I put another one on as well and apparently suddenly miraculously statistic cooldown up at the bottom now there you go you just leave that to fry away a couple of minutes you don't want them a perfect shake it's nice and messy so we just met though surprised for a minute and then we can turn them okay we're gonna turn the pancakes oh look at that I'll stop the lights all that looks delicious yes oh get behind me st. with a bit of butter and jam on that where would you be going now now you see how easy that is it's just like a little two-minute snack food that's as quick as a pancake you know absolutely fantastic so we'll just let those up for another second now when you use in the raw potato on its own you really want to leave them you know you really want to leave them in the pan on a slightly lower setting just to make sure that that wall spiders cut through because even if it's you know not as soft as it should be and it can taste lovely you can get a little bit of a little bit of indigestion that's good to go I'm gonna have one of these right now wait for the plate I'm not even gonna wait for a plate look at this straight off the pan yeah what you do is you just get little bit of butter stick that on there yeah I've got a bit of homemade after jelly here this is what I love the sweet and the savory and saving this subtle jelly now for a big box to blow out could that be any more delicious stop my face room for the time that is fantastic
