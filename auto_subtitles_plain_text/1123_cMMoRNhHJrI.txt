 hi guys how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen I'm trying out my new camera today I use the GoPro just the GoPro grabs you in the last video you guys loved it so thank you very much for that the aim is to combine a little bit of what I did there with using this new camera and play around resolutions and stuff so bear with me this might not be how it finally looked but we'll get there okay that's a day I don't know that was I said today we are going to make some faff a nice easy chickpea kind of burger things in a pita wrap I'm hungry for lunch and that's what I'm going to do so hit pause on the video now and write more down unless Maycomb right so for the fat fell we're going to make it as easy as we can just by using our mini chopper thing if you haven't go on of those you have to chop away a lot right then folks here we are with a lime green so we're going to use to make this part fails I think that's how you pronounce it but some plain flour we're not using all that although it be very very dry some chickpeas that been drained off completely so it's just the chickpeas no water no water in there lemon half lemon juice half a red onion a garlic cloves coriander chili pepper paprika and cumin that is all going boom right in there right it's nearly all in there now I'm very close to the edge are pointing to get a big one of these where there we go I'm going to sprinkle the flour on there just about one and a half tablespoons even get a bit more in there all goes the squeeze on a little bit of that lemon juice or you and then we're going to get the lid on it right so on goes the lid and yeah let's give it some whirly action right right so with the mixture all done it should look something like that all nice and colourful and funky we're going to get it down there on a chopping board right now yeah this is a messy bits I'm a little bit worried about hitting the pause button on my camera any minute now but you don't need to worry about that so I've got there's a little bit in my hands like so I'm just going to shape it it does hold its shape quite well actually that's why you need to make sure it's kind of dry and you drain those chickpeas properly baby make them into a little ball shapes like this and then you can have like a ball shape or maybe these are squishing down a little bit like that do that to all of these stuff no go press that button okay so with the fan tells I've only made six for the which is plenty as it's just me here at the moment that would do nicely but you actually got enough to make double that so six times two equals twelve do you like how I did my maths they're kind of cool right so rather than frying them straightaway which you can do we're just going to push them to one side and just work on our salad a bits which won't take very long at all okay then folks oh it's this bowl I'm going to put some spinach and rocket leaves big handful of chopped parsley oh yeah these are my leftover bits of parsley one spring onion and free cherry tomatoes will slice to push that all in or yeah baby I'm just going to trim some cress like maybe half a Punnett will get it everywhere just on top of that bit awkward there I just washed it and it's dripping don't really want the soil in there no no no no good squeeze lemon juice a another half a year and I grind in a pepper like a teaspoon or maybe a little more you're feeling kinky then I'm just gonna get my hands in there combine it all together and that is gonna really complement those full of fun if I pull up on a bow there we go that'll do nicely you want to smell it oh yeah okay folks once you reach this stage you get your salad ready and you've got your five fouls out there doing their thing any other thing to do really is get your pita breads like a pita bread brah maybe not okay I just got toasted that's a boring step so I'm not going to show you that we're gonna go straight on to frying up off an apparel apparel felt all right so I'm just getting a flame there and I'm going to warm up my pan like so a little bit of oil olive oil sunflower oil vegetable oil not engine car oil that would be bad alright that was nice and hot now but just to show you the pita breads been all nice and toasted and they've actually increased in volume a little bit so then cool down a teeny weeny bit but anyhow let's just sit these in there all year can you hear that sizzling nice and gentle finna going to take about two or three minutes either side and we'll flip them and then we can fill them right so once they're done they should look a little bit like that nice and browned on the tops both sides in the middle there's still any yummy and squishy so clearly now is stuff them in our pita breads with us head and maybe a little bit of sweet chilli sauce good times there's my thumb good times sorry alright folks as you can see already made one so what I did was grabbed pitabread like so and stuffed it's kind of come out Pharaoh I'm just stuffing a load of salad in there first of all tucking in the fallow fields just sitting them in like that and I'm going to ram a lot more salad in there as well right on top of it like this cram it right in there all my goodness and then finish it with a cheeky drizzle of sweet chili sauce oh my goodness I want to put that in my mouth right away right folks thanks for putting up for me for this video I know I've been a little bit serious but I try to understand the camera for example the last five minutes to spend try and take a picture and it would work so I need to read the manual and while I was doing that I took a big old bite and oh my goodness these are amazing I know another point right now it's like a head nodding pitabread of loving the chickpeas I don't know if the chick is a feminine reference or maybe it's kinda like a chicken reference I'm loving it and maybe it's Latin for like peas love maybe chickpeas equals peace of love I don't know I'm loving it I'm gonna have another bite so good so quick so easy come back from lunch it's nice and light and healthy and it's vegetarian as well crazy so if I can make that absolutely anyone welcome
