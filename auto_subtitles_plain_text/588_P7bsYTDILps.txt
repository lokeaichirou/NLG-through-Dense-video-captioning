 hi I'm Diane cometa and today audition with dye I'm going to show you how to make meatloaf this is a really classic dish and it's very simple to make so let's get started on dish and woods I you need some ground beef that's been sitting at room temperature for about an hour and this is an 80 20 percent fat ratio I also have a finely minced sweet onion some wishes your sauce some prepared mustard some garlic powder ground pepper and salt this is some bread slices that I've cut into small cubes some ketchup some barbecue sauce milk at room temperature an egg and some additional ketchup so the first thing that we're going to do is take the room temperature milk and pour that right over these bread cubes and we're just gonna let this sit for a few minutes so that the bread can kind of absorb that I'm just gonna toss that around a little bit and now I'm gonna mix together some of the seasonings so I have this little bit of ketchup here and I'm gonna take the onion and put that in along with the wishes sheer sauce I can never pronounce this the same two times Wish Oshiro wish a shire Wurster sauce and then this is the prepared mustard and then the salt pepper and garlic powder and then you're just gonna whisk this together with a fork just to get it all combined because I don't want to just kind of dump it in there and have one area where there's a whole bunch of garlic powder and another area where there's not and then take that egg and then you just want to whisk that together and then over here to our bowl with our meat and I'm just going to take the ketchup with the onion mixture and I'm going to pour that right on in and then in with our breadcrumb mixture and then throw in your egg and then you're gonna get your hands in there and kind of toss this around so just lightly until everything gets really thoroughly combined you have a baking sheet here that I've lined with some parchment paper and I just put the parchment paper on there so that this doesn't stick to just get the meatloaf out onto the parchment and then shape that into a nice loaf you see I didn't pack it too tight and now I have that little bit of ketchup and barbecue sauce so we're just going to mix these together now when I was a kid my mom always used ketchup but I like to kind of jazz it up a little bit with a little bit of the barbecue sauce and then just pour this right over the top and just kind of spread it out nice and evenly and it's as simple as that that's it it's ready to go into my oven 350 degrees for about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes or until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160 degrees and then you want to take it out and let it rest for about 10 minutes before you slice into it if you try to slice into it when it's very hot it might crumble a little bit so you just want to let it sit on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes and then I'll show you what it looks like there it is it cooked for about an hour it's nice and crisp on the outside with that nice moist top and its moist and tender on the inside and it's great with mashed potatoes the recipe is on my website dish and with DICOM don't forget like subscribe and share I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious up the time bye-bye now you
