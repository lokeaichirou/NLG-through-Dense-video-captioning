 ok today we're going to make a really simple dish and it's basically called bangers and mash which is mashed potato and sausages I'm also gonna do a little bit of onion just to go with it so here we go I think the first thing is choose your potato some are better for mashing than others but generally you can use pretty much most potatoes have a look on the packet if you're unsure some say they're for mashing and some don't ok I've peeled my potatoes now what we want to try and do is to get these to cook evenly throughout the potato so you don't get these lumpy bits now one way of ensuring that it's just pick the middle and chop that up like so and again same on that one do it in the middle for all of those whoops didn't quite do that in the middle and in mine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to chop them up many more than that otherwise it was all too much water so chop them down the middle pop them in the pan and then we're going to boil them for a slowly boiling for about 15-20 minutes probably about 20 minutes okay now for the cooking I'll boil the kettle got some hot water in there saves a bit of time so we're just going to fill that little bit over the side there put some solving I think it helps to break down a potato and adds a little bit to the flavor so put that and we're going to tip the water away so that's fine pop the lid on turn the heat on and we're going to cook it simmer over sized or middle heat for about 15 minutes while we're cooking the potatoes in the back that I've moved into the bag we're just going to put in the sausages try and pick really nice sausages because you know in the day is half the meal really the sausages so try and pick the good ones getting from the butchers or you know there's various mates out there that are really nice just try what do you want so popping in the oil obviously you can grill these if you're a little bit more health-conscious you haven't got a you know fry them but it's probably easier so what I'm gonna do is just pop a lid on those and I'm going to turn them over get them nice and brown on the ice outside they're probably only going to take about 10 minutes in total or get internal heat they're not too I just want to brown and without uh cooking today so there's your bangers there's your match so now we've got the sausages on the next thing to put on we've got a frying pan here is for your onions so what we want to do is chop them up okay I've got the youngers all chopped 2 onions I've used we've got the oil turn it up a little bit to make sure it's nice and hot and then what we're going to do is just pour in the onions now you can cook those either until they caramelize which is slightly brown on the outside which is probably what I'm gonna do or you can cook them a little bit less now you were at a 10-minute stage a quick test and it's a really good one it's just to stick a knife in if you can get it in and see if the potatoes are done these are clearly not done ten minute mark probably another 10 minutes outside you but I'll check them just before then okay we're at the 15 minute mark now I'm just going to check these potatoes yeah they're just slightly falling off what you want to do with the players is slightly overcook them rather than undercook them otherwise you get the lump so five more minutes so 20 minutes for the potatoes and I think we're done and then we're going out the perfect mash okay we're at the 20 minute stage and I think the potatoes are done now so we're just going to check that if you put the knife in they definitely fall off if they're hesitant they're not quite done so what I'm now going to do is drain as much water out as possible I'm probably going to use a lid for that and just tip it way down the drain we're not going to use that water for anything at the moment okay I've I've put the potato back on the hob which is I mean I've actually got it turned off so it's really nice and hot now now what we want to do with the potato is just gently chop it like so and then we're going to add a little bit at that time and mix it all up it's all pretty straightforward now what we can do is add a little bit of salt again to the whole mixture a little bit of pepper so obviously I better taste and then we're going to pop in a little bit of butter now if you're a bit health-conscious obviously you can use a little bit less I know some of you out there are I'm just going to put that in like so and just gently kind of mix it all together and try and get as many of those lumps out as possible and then I'm going to use one of these these are great they make it job easy if you haven't got one of these you can mix it by hand don't worry if you've spilled bit on the edges and we're on it's looking good now looking good try and get as many of those things out now the important thing is when you're mixing my place though you don't want to keep mixing a mix and mixing otherwise it ends up starting to be like glue almost you know now if you like your mashed potato a little bit creamier all I personally do but not too creamy you can add a little bit of milk again any sort of meal semi skim skimmed whatever you've got don't go overboard you can always have a little bit more after but it makes it much more creamy I know my children like it more creamy but that's really nice as we've got it they're lovely now there's a lot of things you can add to the mashed potato personally I prefer the chives actually there we are nice fine fresh chives and you can add some of those with it put that on the plate and eat it hey there we've got it mashed potato this one's got chives on it you can just pop a couple of nice sausages on top there like so and I've got a little bit vegetable just got a little bit of cabbage there a lot a bit of cabbage himself but obviously you can have peas or whatever you like and finally got a little bit caramelized onion always goes well like side then we can just put a little bit of gravy on it and you've got a fantastic meal so obviously put it is and if you like a little bit more pepper you can put it on as you want that is fantastic food
