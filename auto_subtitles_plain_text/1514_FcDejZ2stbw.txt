 hey dudes I'm Hilah and welcome to Hilah cooking today I'm gonna show you possibly the most famous breakfast in the world and also the one that was voted most likely to kill you it's the eggs benedict and it's a poached egg with Canadian bacon over a toasted English muffin and then covered in hollandaise sauce it's really delicious and there's a lot of controversy about where it was invented but I'm really convinced that it was probably right here in the good old US of A so put that in your pipe and smoke it Great Britain good day [Music] okay step numero uno we want to separate our eggs and just put the yolks in here in a bowl and you can save the whites in the fridge for a few days just cover it if you want to like Adam - scrambled eggs later so you don't have to waste them and then I'm gonna add a little bit of water and I've got this I'm just a bowl about an inch and a half of water down there and the pan underneath so I'm kind of I've got a rigged up double boiler but I like this actually better than double boiler because see this bowl has a nice round bottom so it's gonna round bottom so it's gonna make it easier for me to stir it up really well so once the water and the yolks are incorporated kind of over a medium heat we're just gonna cook these over some simmering water for maybe five minutes or so until they start to thicken up a little bit okay now you can kind of see when I scrape the sides it leaves a trail like the whisk is able to kind of cut through the foamy stuff so that's good that means we are in the right time and place and then I've got some melted butter here I just melted it in the microwave my little Pyrex deal so then I can pour it in so this is where the whisking is super-important whisk it constantly I'm just gonna have trickle this butter in there a little by little basically what we're making it is an emulsion sauce so it's like if you ever made a loli or mayonnaise it's the same process except using oil instead of butter so this way is a lot healthier just make sure you're getting the sides and now when you start adding the butter is when you see it really start to kind of thicken and that's that emulsification process happening when you're getting the egg and the butter so that they make an acquaintance and they form droplets within droplets and decide to be good friends so the last of the butters going in I did start to get a few little lumps because I had my heat too high so let that be a lesson to you it's a slow and patient process much like many things in life that are worth doing and this is starting to look awesome there look at that you can really see like in the last 30 seconds or so it's changed a lot and texture okay this is great I'm actually gonna turn the heat completely off now and I don't really want all this white solids I'm just gonna leave most of that in my little cup okay Wow and I got my lumps pretty much beating out of there and now I'm gonna add some Tabasco sauce to my arm um you could leave this out but I like kind of I don't know I like it a lot obviously you know me and some lemon juice and I also like a lot of lemon juice I'm gonna probably put in a tablespoon or so beautiful a little bit salt unless you're using salted butter I always use unsalted butter if you are using butter that was assaulted then you probably don't need to add any salt and mmm that more lemon just because that's the way I like it but that's pretty adjustable to your taste okay this is gorgeous now this really is best if you use it immediately but I still have to like poach some eggs and toast some things so I'm just gonna leave it still in the warm water just keep it warm and just gonna put a lid on it and it'll be good for another 20-30 minutes if it stiffens up on you you might need to add a little bit of warm water to loosen it before you serve it but should still be fine while you get everything else together so yay we did it good job everybody all right Tim for assembly so I just toasted my English muffins on the same pan and I just did this to under the broiler with my little okay bacon so heat up the bacon and crisp it up a little bit so that's it's washing a dish so you want that in a little Canadian bacon and then I've got a poached egg here I actually already made a video on how to poach eggs but it's exclusive to the learn to cook book so if you have that um you should have gotten an email update with that if you don't have the book you can still buy it or you can just go look up how to poach eggs you know there's a ton of great videos on YouTube and then I've got my hollandaise sauce which is still nice and thin it's not gotten you know overly thick or anything so Oh God smells like blown in Tabasco and to my favorite things ever okay and I like to cook my poached eggs for like six minutes cuz I don't not a huge fan of like a bunch of right business happening so do you want more runny stuff than cooking for less holy crackers well this Speights gonna take me a long time to eat I'm sorry guys I have to do it though mm-hmm damn it that's so good mmm you guys Wow dude that's pretty look at that like a little little sunshine in there just cute so they're trying to make Eggs Benedict or hollandaise sauce so you're probably gonna have some leftover sauce it's really good on asparagus and broccoli and all that stuff too so there you go it's also one of the French mother sauces pretty sure um so now you know something that French people know congratulations all right thanks for watching if you have any questions leave them in the comments below and hope you all have a great day and I hope you try this for brunch this weekend yay that sounds fun [Music]
