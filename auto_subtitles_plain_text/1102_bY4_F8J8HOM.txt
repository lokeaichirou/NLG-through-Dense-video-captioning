 hey guys welcome back to dragons TV this is dragon and today I'm doing a cooking video and guess what I'm making today hmm yep you got it it's nan or nan one of my favorite flatbread so what we would need is one teaspoon of yeast 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 a cup of warm water 3 tbsp soy milk 1 teaspoon salt and about 2 cups of bread flour and 2 tablespoons of olive oil okay let's make the dough so I know lukewarm water we're gonna go ahead and add the yeast oops okay add the yeast and then we're gonna go ahead and add the sugar just a little bit to help activate the yeast we're gonna mix it well and don't worry about the lumps um it should be okay let it sit for ten minutes okay in the meantime we're gonna go ahead and shift the bread flour I had divided the bread flour into two parts the first part is a cup and a half which I'm shifting right now and the second one is a half a cup I like to go ahead and divide them so it's easy to mix the wet with the dry ingredients so go ahead and shift until all the lumps are gone and then we're going to add the rest of the ingredients here's the sugar salt and up not that yet the soy milk I'm gonna make a little hole and put the soy milk in the middle and the olive oil okay go ahead and clean the workstation you know we like a nice workstation oh don't forget you east add the yeast mixture into the bowl and mix well I like to use my hands I don't mind getting dirty but if you don't like getting your hands sticky you can use a spatula or wooden spoon and go ahead and add the rest of the bread flour and we're going to mix it well go ahead and dump the whole thing onto your workspace to start kneading and take out all of the good dough and start kneading I like to just fold it and press it down fold and press it down there is no correct way you can do it the way you want to but this is how I do it you're going to go ahead and knead this for about six to eight minutes or until it's incorporated evenly if you're using a logic mixer probably about three to four minutes so go ahead and keep doing this until it's mixed the you is my dough beautiful isn't it okay we're gonna go ahead and get a clean bowl and spray oil or you can dab it oil onto a napkin and just wipe the bowl well go ahead and spray on top as well we're gonna cover this for one hour to rise or until it doubles and I'm gonna get something to cover here okay all righty see you back in an hour okay here's my doll about an hour later I should have at least doubled in size and we're gonna go ahead and sprinkle some flour onto the working surface and this is how I divide my dough's I like to go ahead and pinch and pull we just pinch and pull I'm making six Nant a medium sized man if you wanted a bigger size you'll probably want to make four pieces because the smaller you get you won't be able to stretch it too much you're going to go ahead and cover again and let it rise for about ten minutes so after 10 minutes take one of the small dough and you're gonna start rolling out the dough now today I'm using a class I didn't have a rolling pin when I did this video so I'm just using what I have don't judge okay so you're gonna roll it out as thinly as you want and just pull it out like you make a pizza make sure you don't pull it out too much you don't want a hole and your breath so something like this okay so after 30 minutes of rising you're gonna take a pan and preheat it on medium-high you're gonna go ahead and Pat the flattened dough with water and place it on the pan if you don't have a non-stick pan make sure you grease the pan before putting the dough down you're gonna cook each side about two to three minutes on each side and then you'll notice that there's gonna be bubbles that comes up and then you'll know to start flipping just as if you were making pancake so if you can see there's a bubble actually forming or starting to form on the dough and it's going to be about a minute to flip it over to the other side okay so I've went ahead and flipped on both sides and then mmm so if you notice there's a nicely brown charge on each side of the gel and once you're done with that you'll put it aside and I like to brush it with melted butter you can also use olive oil or you can just leave it plain sometimes I like just leaving it plain it's not necessary to actually brush anything on these they're as good as they are by themselves so so here we go so thank you guys for watching this video and I know I haven't put out a lot of cooking video for a while and I hope that I can get more out pretty soon so thank you again till next time this is dragon bye
