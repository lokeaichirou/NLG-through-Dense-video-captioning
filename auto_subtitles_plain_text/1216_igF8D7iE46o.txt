 about a year and a half ago somebody asked me and made corn dogs and I told him no I wouldn't do it but I've changed my mind I'm gonna use about 1 cup of cornmeal a cup of flour 1 cup of milk some baking powder cream style corn don't have to have that you can leave it out 1/4 cup sugar and egg and some hot dogs and salt and I believe that's everything before the batter we want to use a food processor because I'm going to use the canned corn creamed corn otherwise you don't need to use one I'm going to add the egg add about 4 tablespoons of the creamed corn which is optional it's worth teaspoon of salt mix this up very well okay next the cup of milk the sugar 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup of all-purpose flour the baking powder add two teaspoons of baking powder and the cornmeal one cup of cornmeal and that's our batter you can add other things to it if you like like a little bit of red pepper cayenne pepper or jalapenos and I need to let this rest for about 15 minutes I've taken my hotdogs and put a stick in there and dry them off very well anywhere they went duhkham get some coating on there cream in your oil here just hold it down there the best you can they won't come out perfect like what you buy in the store but they'll taste a lot better you might Friday's for about three minutes to five minutes here I have two of the corn dogs it cooled off for about 24 minutes and I like the mustard [Music] that is so good uh-huh excuse me way better than we're better than what I bought thanks so much for watching
