 hey everyone I'm Judith Jones food and travel editor of the gourmet Travel ISTA and today I'm going to be showing you how to make the perfect grilled cheese yeah the ultimate indulgence so for the classic grilled cheese all we're going to need is spurt three very basic ingredients your bread your cheese your butter so we have two slices of thickly sized white bread we have two slices of sharp cheddar cheese and we have two tablespoons of butter now if you don't have a flat griddle and the best thing you can use is a cast-iron pan that's going to be the perfect instrument to use to give you a perfect golden crust so first things first let's get our red now be very generous with your butter and we're gonna butter one side of the bread now just to let you know we've got our pan on a medium heat and we've let it get nice and hot smoking hot in fact we're just gonna really generously lava the butter on this can't have enough butter in grilled cheese absolutely and we're going to do the same to the other side alright get that all going there now there's various different ways you can make grilled cheese you know a lot of people even do it in the oven and you can put the butter in first in the pan but this is one of the easiest and simplest or more well known ways so we've got our two bread's buttered like that now I have my cheddar cheese but first of all we're gonna put our bread butter side down into our cast iron pan and let that go a little now I have my cheddar cheese cheddar cheese is from a nice little village in Somerset in England now there's a lot of cheeses that say they're cheddar but they're not actually they're just processed cheese's so if you want the actual cheddar cheese from England make sure you look at the label so we've got our sharp cheddar cheese here you can use a mild one too and we're just going to place that on top of the bread or put two slices nicely on there so as that goes we are gonna put our second bread butter side up on top of the cheese and we're going to let that all melt in there and it usually takes about three minutes ish to cook on either side we're gonna be nice let it get a nice golden brown so there you go now obviously there's tons of variations you can do with the with the grilled cheese but this is like the really the classic one and you serve that with a nice tomato soup and you're done you're good so as that's going nice medium heat I'm gonna get that done for a couple of minutes so we as we see that cheese oozing in it's been a couple minutes we're gonna do a clip quick flip of the sandwich so there we go flip it and as you can see it's got a nice golden brown there and that's exactly what we want so that butter is just gonna toast and crisp the other side and that cheese is just gonna melt lovely inside there we go another couple minutes in there on your cast-iron pan now the cast-iron pan is great because it keeps in that heat and it makes the bread nice and crispy on the outside yet still nice and soft inside so that's toasted really nicely it's been another couple of minutes and we're just gonna set it down on the cup of cutting board but on the other side and look at that perfect golden brown crispy and we're gonna cut that o through the middle we're gonna see that she's losing ah how good is that so indulgent and let's just plate it up plate right there and there you have it everyone that is your perfect grill team thanks for watching today everyone and make sure to subscribe to our website to watch plenty of other fantastic videos and if you have an email request you can email requests at Mahalo comm and we'll be sure to answer any questions and queries you might have
