 folks tonight in the vault shelf that I'm putting together some tacos from Mexico he's a real mexicana tacos this is the kind of stuff you see down at Taco Bell these are the real deal tacos the way they come down in the places I've been in Mexico and that are really good but they're not what you think they are so I wish you exactly how I prepare the meat with this whole taco dinner together and I think you'd be pretty impressed with the amount of results let's get started all right meat selection is very very important in making your tacos you're not going to need a ground beef for these forget that it's not gonna work I don't even know what they used to talk about but what i do is i marinate my beef and i put a little bit of onion and some jalapeno with some fajita which is basically flank steak yes we heated their res and I just take a little bit not a lot because the line will actually cook the meat but I put a little bit of lime on to my fajita and then this is a bauru it's just some sort of Mexican seasoning they use it's got I think different things openly doesn't have any msg or anything like that in it too much but the most important thing here is a little bit of cumin just a little bit that's pretty strong it's been sitting around in your spice cabinet for a minute you probably got to check it you need to keep that nice and fresh even though it is a dried spice and we're gonna let this mijita meat marinate while we fire up our charcoal grill and we're gonna be grilling this thing off here in a minute all right we got our coal just down to some members or fajita is now nicely marinated off put that right up on the grill these rednecks do it and last but not least put this other little guy over here when you're known here whole thing isn't gonna hurt anything gonna roast off right there and the cooking process had the overall flavor of the dish put the top all right this big straight off the grill still has a little bit of a pink Center in Mexico no way they want this stuff well done I'm up it's for sanitary reasons or whatever but I've never met a Mexican look like their carne asada their tacos or anything like that anything but well done for me there's the first batch of the Vahid ameet and down in Mexico they don't use to have a hard shell or soft shell though I mean you have flour tortillas they have two T Ria's I don't know why then we load them up to over like that and then they just take with the meat right on top of that just like that that's how you get an order of Mexico let's take these over and we'll dress these up all right now for the toppings well for one they've got a lot of different kinds of cheeses of Mexico that you've probably never heard of cases there are okay Blanco I like Mancha goat cheese on my tacos the Mexico that's probably similar to Monterey Jack I've got a little bit here I got up about local Mexican marcado that was kind of graded up I believe it's a goat cheese I'm not really quite sure and then that were to put the pico de gallo on here which is a Mexican spicy relish with tomatoes and cilantro you've seen this in my earlier video you know exactly how to make that and of course we're going to top this off with a little bit of walk come over there wouldn't be complete without it and then I'm gonna use a little bit of chole Lula's hot sauce I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly that's what they would have done it for some reason on the counter put a little dab'll do you write on there and if you visit the big taste test those tacos were muy bueno que Rico I think what this may not be what they serve down there and old El Paso but it didn't ship weird either this is a real Mexican taco deal and if you want to give this one a try you can't go wrong with it it really is quite good I've been going down to Mexico since the 70s probably down there 40 times it's always the same drue Mexican you probably ain't gonna do this ready to do that Roy yeah so what I like them teach like what I eat down there anyone sophisticated as a palate as you yet to do but this tastes like your Mexican talk about of me thanks for watching folks sub me if you like my channel here I got a lot of crazy stuff going on of course as always and I like the video if you liked it you know tell me why thanks for watching and as always buon apetito
