 I am Antonio Carlucci welcome to my kitchen I show you how to make the real carbonara most of the people are get it wrong and let me show you why now this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter water so as to be like this and immediately then we put in as to be boiling the pasta in this case is sort of spagett Toni the biggest size of spaghetti while this is cooking it takes a good 10 minutes and no oil please no oil you don't need it you just need to stir a little bit when it's in it and that's it now for the original carbonara you need the guanciale which is the chief to poultry and the Romans they are very special in that because they do it they cure it like ham or like pancetta and it's very tender very tasty and tender now you have to cut it in chunks you can use naturally also unchecked the normal pancetta which is this one here but I like the one charlie when I hear it obviously and this is the recipe for two people big chunks the Romans they are made for this pasta if there is a Roman faster this this one here this quite a lot for two people let's see and the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil put in a pan they're young put the guanciale into that and this is the beginning of the source and mostly also the end of it because the rest is coming here into that bowl and now you take some good eggs and for two people you take two eggs or lovely color look at this to be a little bit naughty I take just the yolk and we beat it so these you don't have any any any cream absolutely forbidden so this is the beginning of the sauce so we put a bit of parmesan at the in Roma they use also pecorino cheese which is a cheese to be grated they are fresh pecorino and age category but it's lovely to have this abundant pepper and another stir and this is the source I wouldn't put any salt here because the bacon here it's a quite salty sir preserved he reduced it a little bit because I'm going to see what the pastor does I can see it is still stiff so I could eat back again another three or four minutes now here's the baton that it's produced also quite a lot of fat should you be not wanting the fat I show you a little trick here we are and do this you absorb a little bit of the fat and you take it out like this very simple so the pasta seems to be doing well here the taste now should be enough I switched off the guanciale because it's too hot ends is exactly what I don't want to be too hot so now I take the pasta and I put it into the yes and you flavor it like this you let it cool down in doing this and it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta and now it comes to yes the resistance the actual sauce there you are and now we stir it like this this usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the egg with some scrambled eggs not too scrambling and this is the carbonara and now the last touch which is the embellishment Parmesan or pecorino depending what you write and in my opinion also a nice touch of pepper this is decoration for me and this is the real carbonara the only one and this exactly or should it be creamy without adding cream because this is the usual thing like this is just fantastic hmm cameraman everybody you should taste is just wonderful you
