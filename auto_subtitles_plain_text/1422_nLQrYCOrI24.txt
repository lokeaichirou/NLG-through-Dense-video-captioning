 hi I'm Anya welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to show you how to prepare booshka those are little tiny pirogue is stuffed with dried mushrooms feeling and we sell them with the red borscht which there is recipe on my channel as well and I will put a link below in the description box if you would like to have a look look at the ingredients so you know what you need in case you decide to give the child I'm starting usually in the evening I'm going to soak my dried mushrooms and I'm going to leave it overnight now you can do it minimal two hours the best four hours but then it's I'm usually leaving it overnight then the next day I'm pouring all my mushrooms into a saucepan and putting it on my stove and on the low heat I'm going to be cooking it until the mushrooms are getting really soft it might take an hour an hour and a half it depends on the mushrooms just make sure that you mixing them from time to time and if you need more water just add water so they don't get burned and when they are finally soft I'm putting them on my strainer and pushing with my head I get rid of the excess liquid now I am going to be holding on to that liquid in the pot I might need a lighter on and then on my frying pan I'm adding on to three tablespoons of oil and warming it up then adding my onion and frying it until it gets nice soft and glossy and when this is ready transferring my mushrooms into my food processor adding green on your hands and then seasoning it with salt and pepper process it for around the minute I would say and it looks like that okay and then I'm usually transferring into the mixing bowl and then I'm going to be checking it for seasoning right now then in my case I needed to add and more salt and more pepper okay and then I gave it a good stir so all the salt the pepper is nicely mixed stuffing and then I covered with the silicon a plastic wrap and put into the fridge and I'm making the pierogi actually the next day it does not have to stay so if you want you can do it the same day for me it's just easier this way okay so I have a large pot full of water I add one teaspoon of salt and putting it to bring it to a boil and in the meantime in my food processor I'm adding my flour salt and then adding one egg okay and then I'm going to start processing it first just like this everything gets mixed and then slowly I'm adding my hot water and I'm watching well what's happening in my food processor okay and when the dough starts forming a bowl just like that I'm not adding any more water that's why it's important to just keep adding it slowly so you catch the moment when it's ready here we go and then I'm usually dividing the dough in half putting one in and sits a button then the other one I'm rolling out on the floured surface and then with my pizza cutter I am cutting little squares more or less four centimeters by four centimeters for my four here we go and then with the tiny spoons I'm going to be putting them here we go a small ball of starting and putting in the middle of my square closing the corners to create like a kind of triangle and then I'm closing the other corners together and it's like a little ring but it is an ear actually so here we go again a little bit of stuffing remember to flip the the the no so you are closing with the site which was laying on the table because it's closing better if you have a little bit of problems with sticking it together put a little a little bit of water on the side and will your finger wet the dough and then when my water is boiling I'm gently adding my my mousse got into the water the important part when you don't overcrowd the card and as well as when you add them very gently steer it with the wooden spoon so they don't get stuck to the bottom and from the moment they surface you want to point them for another two minutes and then they are ready on the plane you wanna spray them a little bit with the nonstick spray just so they don't stick together and then you serve them with red bushed okay I hope you guys enjoy the recipe and let me know what you think and I will see you next time fine
