 today I know this looks weird but today I'm a may be making Waldorf chicken and salad the first thing you do is this is chicken breast just a boneless skinless chicken breast this is a 30 ounce package or 1.87 Palin package all I did was cut the chicken breast up into strips or a bowl a little faster and I'm gonna get it in a pan of water and boil it once it hits boiling if you do it about 20-25 minutes just to where it's cooked through that's the first step so that's the first thing I'm gonna get this started and then when I come back I'll show you all the ingredients but you gotta cook your chicken first fourth of a cup of light mayonnaise you need a three tablespoons of fat-free sour cream you need three tablespoons of lemon juice now just use this this lemon juice in the little plastic things you know fourth of a teaspoon of salt fourth of a teaspoon of pepper and sometimes this is to flavor to taste so if you put a little bit less then you know who everything you can put more on there if they want you need to read Delicious apples it's about a half a pound of Red Delicious apples make sure you get Red Delicious because they have the good the flavor and the texture you want so get those a one and a half cups of cute chicken this is a boneless skinless chicken breast just use the whole thing chop it up into about I don't know one inch or half inch cubes basically that's what you want and then you want a 1 cup of seedless red grapes have so you're gonna rinse those off and cut those in half and then you want a half a cup of diced celery think it's about 2 or 3 stalks you'll have to just measure it out once you chop it all up and then we would 2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts and you really got a toast these and I'll show you how I toast these in a pan in just a little bit so I'm gonna get started chopping some things up like the apples and celery and the grapes getting them all measured out and I'll be back okay I'm on the last thing I'm chopping up here's my apples I've got my chicken measured out and we've got a cup and a half I think of chicken got everything else the celery chopped up nice and fine you don't want huge hunks of celery in there but everything else measured out in the grapes I'm measuring I'm cutting them and putting them in a measuring cup you need one cup so I'm filling up this twice so what I do is I cut them long ways and then I cut them sideways just like that cuz it says halved but I like them into four so let me get a big one so you can see so I cut it lengthwise like that and then while I'm holding it I cut it side to side so then you get these like little fourths of a cup of grapes and those are really good to kind of to buy they're little smaller than bite size so it really mixes in well with the chicken and everything you can see I didn't use all my Apple and I still have three like sections left what I will probably do since I have chicken leftover I'm gonna have plenty of grapes and have plenty of celery I've got plenty of everything by the way that was about two stalks of celery was what that was I will probably make another like two probably two smaller batches of this this will probably make about I think it makes about four cups and will tell you the calories and stuff too but I think it makes about four cups of just this batch and then and then all I'll make up the rest you can see how much chicken I have left here which is probably about as much as that so I could probably make two batches I've got enough Apple I believe and maybe a little less on the second batch from the first batch maybe I'll grab a little bit of this and save it because I probably scooped it over this it was praying a little bit of a heaping half cup when I was making them so I could take a handful and not a huge handful just a piece of those and sit aside and mix it all together and do another batch that way she's got enough to last pretty much all week long to eat these mills and they will last and refrigerator for about a week so anyway let fish give me chocolate I'll show you how to put it all together and touch the almonds and then putting that walnuts and then put it all together okay I want to show you how you toast walnuts what I do is just get a pan this is a nonstick pan I have I'll put it on about medium high and on me my butt about six a little bit higher than medium it needs two tablespoons of walnuts so I'm literally measuring out my wallets because you're wanting your calories to be measurable you know you want to have a second set of calories and literally I'm going to let it sit there it doesn't look like much but they don't add a lot of flavor and you get really big pieces like this now what I'll do is sometimes break them into smaller pieces just did but spread a little bit more and the flavor will be there but you don't need big hunks of walnut in there you just need small pieces but these will once the pan starts heating up it will you don't want burn them they'll do get hot pretty fast Amyas breaking with your fingers they're not hard okay so while my walnuts while the paint's waiting to heat up in seven you'll start smelling I mean all I gotta do is shake the pan a little bit to keep them from sticking it's not that big a deal you can even turn the heat up a little bit higher if you want medium high they can go a little bit faster you can do that too just keep use your nose and you'll know but you don't want to burn them because they get bitter and so basically to my chicken I'm gonna add my apples and just dump them in to be bold and I drapes and I just like to add the fruit in the celery first I like to add all the bigger ingredients first and then what I do is I kind of turn this to where it kind of mixes it all together you know roughly mixing it together cuz you don't want any big hunks of chicken in there with nothing else you really want to look at everything and then the lemon juice the lemon juice keeps your apples from turning brown I think that's the only sole purpose for that actually there now go ahead and put my sour cream in my mayonnaise and if you want to good dump your salt and pepper on top too but it's kind of sprinkled out because you don't want a big ol about bunch of salt and pepper I'm one place and once you stir it up it'll be fine and this is not gonna be a really wet wet chicken salad it's gonna be a it's just gonna be more for flavor than anything it's not going to be a traditional chicken salad it's really just for the flavor I mean just to kind of bond is just a little bit and then I'll stir it up more once I got my walnuts F the walnuts are still going over there so I'm just gonna give them a shake okay there you can smell you can smell it more than anything and like I said you don't want to burn them but you can start smelling they start smoking just a little bit once you get that you literally just pour them right in you hear a little sizzle and that will add you wouldn't believe how much flavor that is those flats and they have to be toasted because they're just a regular walnut won't to add that the full flavors because when you toast a walnut it brings up the oils and stuff in the net and really brings out the flavor of some so that's it that's really yeah I'm gonna give it a little taste for salt and pepper I grab a little spoon a good ol paste and a little bit of everything in there perfect get that really tender chicken that crunch of the apple and celery the sweetness of the grace it's wonderful so that's a perfect nice so what I'm gonna do now is we've got these a long time ago these some we bought these little containers that want more I only know they make me more they probably do they're just Rubbermaid containers but they have a screw on lid and there are two cup containers if you fill it up to this line on the inside so that's how I portion them out now let's take a scoop you know I get it right up until about two cups and Tammy might want more salt in these salt and pepper in these and she might know a little less that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna get these divvied out and she's got a meal for the next she need dinner for the next four nights on this since I made extra she might actually I know how she is sometimes she ate this for lunch and at dinner last time we used to make it it'll last a good week in the refrigerator may no longer than that I think the apples and stuff will tend to go Bulls start being a little soft if you wait too long buttons but I'm a helper you limit other to so so anyway that's it I hope you enjoyed this recipe I think it's a good low-calorie I'll turn it we will come back you might just post the calories and you want me to come back and say what the calories are you think whatever we may be back or tenant as posted as text F is both the total calories are Bo my the other bullets no are we gonna post the total calories for each for a 2 cup conserving I'm sorry but you know what they are going to hang back I want a many calories are in each two cup bowl is right around 230 calories we weight everything as we were going we calculated based on your internet calculations for for the different weights and turn 30 Congress is not bad for a two cup serving of that chicken salad so hope you enjoy and that will catch you next time
