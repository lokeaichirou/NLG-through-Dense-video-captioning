 hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with Trader Joe's meatloaf you can read about it in the post why it's called Trader Joe's if you don't know what Trader Joe's are but I'm going to make this meatloaf using ingredients pretty much exclusively from Trader Joe's and the first one is this container of mirepoix it's 14 and a half ounces that's about I don't know three cups or so it's celery carrots onions mirepoix is French for well actually still French for mirepoix but mirepoix is the term for that celery carrot onion mixture and I know what you're thinking chef John wouldn't have been cheaper to cut that yourself no because they make you buy the giant bunch of celery in the store and you only need like two ribs II throw the rest away so this is actually for most of you cheaper to do so we're going to cook this whole container with a big pinch of salt with some unsalted Trader Joe's butter for about ten minutes covered stir it once in a while until it's nice and soft and tender we're going to divide it in half because this half is going to be for the meatloaf and that half for the gravy all right so put half of it in a big mixing bowl and then we're going to cool it down with some double roasted salsa Trader Joe's double roasted salsa anybody can roast salsa once Trader Joe's roasted twice alright 1/2 a cup of Trader Joe's organic milk a dash of Worcestershire sauce and Trader Joe's cage-free eggs you see any cages there's no cages you find a cage in that carton the next dozen half off alright throw one of those eggs in we're going to stir that in I'm going to add some pepper lots of it some cayenne and a good amount of salt you don't want bland meatloaf to you I stir that in then we're going to add our beef I'm using Trader Joe's butcher shop Black Angus don't settle for regular Angus you want Black Angus this is 85% lean very nice beef I get a couple pounds I'm going to mix that in lightly and I'm going to add my dry ingredients which are some dry thyme and organic breadcrumbs that's right Trader Joe's organic breadcrumbs I hate pesticides in my breadcrumbs so I'm gonna use these so I'm gonna put three quarters of a cup in there I'm going to finish the mixing you know the trick meatloaf just mix it till it comes together don't over mix it it'll get tough I'm going to put some oil down on a piece of on my baking sheet and I'm going to form that into a loaf and it's the name of meat about six inches across by about three four inches high right make sure it's nice and smooth I find wetting your fingers works wonders then for the topping I'm going to take some brown sugar that's right from Trader Joe's and mix it in with a couple tablespoons of our double roasted salsa I'm going to paint that over the top and a little bit on the sides and that's going to go in a 325 degree oven for about an hour and ten minutes I like a slow oven I'll show you why later in the meantime we're going to take the other half of the vegetables with another hunk of butter and some flour and we're going to make a quick little roux you know how to do that right we do that all the time we're going to toast that butter and flour together with the vegetables for about five minutes I'm going to take some Trader Joe's organic beef broth really nice all natural and we are going to put in a cup turn the heat up to high and as soon as that starts to thicken and all the brown bits and deliciousness of the vegetables have released from the bottom we can add our other two cups of stock so I'm going to do three cups total I'm going to season that with some pepper and salt a little shot of Worcestershire all right so when it comes to boil we're going to back that down to low and just simmer that for about thirty minutes until it looks like that that is one delicious looking and tasting gravy all right the meatloaf is done how do I know because it's 1:55 exactly that is the optimum temperature for me love you see the bottom of that pan you see a big pool of juice and grease no you see just a little bit that's because all the moisture stays in the meatloaf that also is why we cooked it at a low temperature slice it top it with your gravy served with the traditional mashed potatoes and peas that is one delicious meatloaf recipe now you can make that with any ingredients you want of course if you do live near Trader Joe's makes the shopping list easy I really like their stuff really cheap by the way nicely packaged and a lot of organic stuff a lot of all-natural and by the way there pay me yeah I'll have all the ingredients on the site and as always enjoy
