 welcome to the poor man's gourmet kitchen where we share gourmet recipes and a little bit of wonder now check this out start now with some onion and of course and russet potatoes and we've got to have bacon that the bacon go on a hot pan first thing once you get that cooked start throwing in the onions take advantage of the bacon grease there it will help season those really well a little bit of sugar helps the caramelizing process which will help flavor the onions as well I can't go wrong with some black pepper either but just turn all this together incorporating it really gives a good base to start our clam chowder a little bit of melted butter as soon as that gets about mounted at least halfway anyway you can incorporate all of it together with a little bit of cooking wine flower is going to help us thicken this up you can see it dries it out almost instantly will become very pasty the same way Aroo does before it burns we're going to add some canned clams and definitely definitely at the juice it's going to add a lot of flavor to the clam chatter don't read some pour it out add it to your soup once you get it all stirred in it looks like this you can start adding your cream just going to add a little bit at a time you want to control this so you don't ruin it but as the Heat's on which is about a medium I need got to watch the bottom of your pan especially if your pans then make sure you don't burn it on the bottom it will ruin the entire suit once you bring it up to the top here stir it all in give it a good taste because at this point we need to know if we can add pepper salt whatever you'd like in a bit we're going to add the pepper for sure you get a lot of salt from our bacon and from the canned clams so we're not going to add too much salt but it does need a little bit it's important to have this flavor before the whole cooking of the soup because it will infuse and make it taste better in the long run now the potatoes that I'm adding here obviously need to be cooked here for a little while but the stars of the potato is going to help it thicken up as it reduces and once again make sure you have it all off the bottom of the pan so you don't you don't burn it and send that flavor through the whole soup but rolling it very tedious process but well worth it at the end just mix it all up make sure it's all good to go see it's thin enough force but now I need to ensure that potatoes are completely cooked all the way through almost like they are so we'll be adding our last ingredient which is just some fresh chopped parsley once you get that stirred in here we're ready to serve here in a toasted bread bowl that's the way I like to have it and we'll just fill it all the way to the brim just like that little parsley and there you have it clam chowder right here in the poor man's gourmet kitchen thank you for watching and be sure to stop by poor man's gourmet kitchen com for more recipes and exact ingredients
