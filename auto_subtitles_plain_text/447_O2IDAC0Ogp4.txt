 I know you start smelling bacon cooking and you think is it breakfast time but in our house it could be lunch or dinner especially if we're making this amazing pasta dish spaghetti carbonara which is one of our all-time favorites in our family I'm starting by cutting four strips of bacon or five depending on the size you can see how wide this end is and how narrow this is so we're it's wide I just cut it in half and then just cut Oh about 1/2 inch pieces this is a dish that at any given time has been miles favorite dish Lucas favorite dish and I can tell you that when I come home from a long day at work and I have no time and this can cook pretty much in the amount of time that it takes to cook the pasta it is like the ultimate comfort food for me I've heated my pan I'm putting the bacon right in there should be enough back here to prevent it from sticking but if you have any concerns about that why not add another fat it's a good fat olive oil and just you know sprinkle a little bit over that the pasta is boiling away I put it in trying to time it perfectly it should cook for about 8 to 10 minutes and just let it boil away I always salt my water for my pasta that's really important now here's a like put the essence simple for this dish I have my final pasta bowl here and I'm just going to break 3 eggs right in and what's happening here this is going to create the kind of creamy sauce without cream because once the heat of the pasta hits the final pasta bowl that's going to be just enough to cook the eggs without really making them you know scrambled so one cup of Parmesan cheese and fresh parmesan and a chunk can't be beat for this because the flavor is so amazing but if you buy yours already grated that's fine too you know whatever works for you and gets you in the kitchen cooking so they are maybe that's a little more than a cup that's okay bacon is sizzling away this just gets scrambled with the cheese give a good great of pepper we're almost there so you can see how a twelve year old would really be able to make this mix it up and really make sure that you combine the cheese with the egg all right let's check the bacon I would say just a few more seconds but that's perfect cuz I'm gonna taste the pasta always make sure your pasta is in good shape before you finish your dish all right mmm perfect firm not too soft not too hard now I am going to put this pasta straight into the pot why well I want to create a little bit of sauce with the liquid all right this burner is turned off I'm just going to get the last little bit of pasta so I just want to stir this around a bit the fat from the bacon mixes with that hot liquid and creates an actual sauce okay now what has happened over here is we have yes I know raw eggs but the minute this warm pasta hits this it's going to start to cook but not too fast it's just gonna cream together so I'll come back to this in a second but I just want to get it mixing so I don't overcook these eggs and it just starts to make a beautiful creamy sauce oh this is exactly the way it's supposed to look you'll be able to serve oh I don't know four to six people let me just get the rest out of the pot give it a go if it's the first time you've ever cooked a pasta dish you are gonna be successful for with this one and everybody is going to love you for it I'm gonna give it a little taste can't help myself hmm I'm swooning
