 hey I wanted to show you the soup that I really really enjoy making and it's very simple and versatile and you can have whatever vegetables you like it's actually even better when you make it they had so that all the flavors of the vegetables can kind of mix into the broth of the soup especially the kabocha which has kind of a you know adds a little bit of a sweet flavor and mel's it out so it's going to be a vegetable miso soup with kubota in it so let me show you these ingredients so here are all my ingredients and let me show you kind of the order in which I put them in so I'm going to start off and I'll show you later I'm going to start by adding the onions and the garlic and I don't even chop up the garlic or anything I just put it in whole and then just pull it out pull them up when I find them as I'm eating the soup but they're super super mild anyways by that point so um so add those and then I add the kind of harder longer cooking vegetables like the eggplant and the carrot and the red pepper so they can get nice and soft as well as this is Korean radish but if you can't find Korean radish you can just use daikon it will be just fine and then this capoccia i'm going to use half of it and then leave just save half of it in the fridge for just roasting it in slices just to eat plain because I don't want to enormous amount of soup for today and then towards the end I'll add the mushrooms these are little kind of like enoki mushrooms but they're a little bit a little bit bigger and they don't get there not a enoki mushrooms community stringy and spinach and some kale because you can never have enough greens and actually on the kale I'm going to just rip the leaves off and then put the stems in kind of early on together with the carrots and the eggplants and stuff so that those can second as you use those as well and here's the me so that I use so I don't even have any English on I got this at ranch 99 an asian chinese supermarket chain around here and so this just has you're going to check your ingredients on your me so because some of them have like fish stuff in it if they're trying to make it extra tasty so this just have what are soy bean rice and salt so even if you were like avoiding gluten or whatever this won't be fine I think it's just a yellow yellow miso any kind of yellow nice it would be fine for other me so if you you know want a little bit different flavors and so that's what I got let me get chopping and then I'll show you what that looks like so here are our chopped vegetable i'm going to put in this soup don't you just love eggplant it's like such a pretty color I always get the Chinese they usually call Chinese eggplants the long purple ones I find they have a little bit of a milder flavor and then here see these kale stems you can just chop them up like this really small like this and if you just cook them long enough they're perfectly fine to eat and here's the the Korean radish I peeled it and i diced it up and my mother-in-law actually taught me about adding that to soup any kind of soup or a miso soup in particular she says you know whom will she wanna means like the the broth will be refreshing so this is really nice kind of a mild sweet radder so it's not going to add a whole lot of space so I'm just going to dump all this stuff in the soup over here let's see so this has been boiling here for a while and I'll just dump to sell it so here's the most annoying part and that is cutting up the kabocha squash if you can just kind of get it in half the rest of it's not that bad but I'm not very good at it there once you can get kind of through half of it there it gets you do and then I do actually try to peel it when i use it in the suit because i don't like the textural contrast of the skin with the sort of softness of the inside i like to have just the soft part so i do there we go so i'm just going to scoop the seeds out and then trim off the skin we'll see how that goes here's my squash all cut up and the rest of the veggies have been simmering for a little bit of learning and I'll just going to throw in the squash this is half of it the other half it's fine to keep kabocha squash if you don't want to use the whole thing at once it's fine to keep it cut in the fridge for a couple days and so after this I'm just I just have my zucchini left to add and then at some point is gonna be the mushrooms and the spinach together with the kale and here's a zucchini we're going to put that in as well I found these four little abandon potatoes that i didn't use so i'm just gonna throw those in as well that was gonna help me clean the kale and the spinach are you still up yes thank you now this has been cooking for a while so i'm ready to add my greens and my mushrooms and my miso my mother-in-law taught me also that it's better not to add the miso too far ahead of time let me get a god-like so I'm going to add this there we go and then I don't even know if I can fit all these greens in but we'll we'll try to make it work usually it's the pan and pot is overflowing up to the top by the time I add the green so let me try to see if I can do that I actually had to move to a bigger pot because it was too much as for the timing of all of this I added the onion garlic first and cook that for about 10 minutes while I was chopping up the other stuff then I added the eggplant the carrot the radish I think that was it the red pepper and adapt and cook that for however long it took me until i got the kubota slides up and then I add that and then the zucchini added straight away after that and then I cooked it again for about 10 minutes until I added the little tender mushrooms and the greens so you just kind of I always try to kind of time it so that everything will be properly cooked and you know kind of soft and melty the way I like it but not you know completely mush so I'll check in on that the Greens will shrink down dramatically as it cook obviously but it's definitely going to have lots and lots of good green stuff in this suit the Greens have wilted down a whole bunch so it's about ready I'm just going to actually leave this to sit and eat it probably tomorrow because then the the kabocha kind of melts into the miso and it's delicious and but you could always eat it if you're hungry you could do to right away so that's my favorite soup let me know what you would add to the soup what vegetables you would add I could always use some ideas for mixing of the vegetables alum kind of an with my combinations I always add add little things here and there as I as things come into season or like one sale or whatever at my produce shop see you guys later
