 g'day guys today I'm making one of my favorite dishes of all time tempura prawns and they're very easy so for starters you will need 250 grams of green uncooked prawns now I've removed the shells i've deveined them but I've left the tails intact so now for the batter take 1 cup of ice-cold water now it's very important that it's ice-cold add in one egg and give it a good mix together now I'm adding half a cup of plain flour and half a cup of corn flour now you can use just 1 cup of plain flour here but I'll find adding the corn flour adds an extra crispiness and lightness to the batter you can also add a pinch of bicarb and now I'm just going to give this a very gentle mix don't overwork it and don't worry about removing the lumps and here I've got some oil preheated to 160 degrees Celsius now just a quick word on the oil guys it is very dangerous and if you don't know how to use it properly then grab someone who does before trying this so now simply hold the prawn by the tail and dip it into that beautiful light tempura batter and then gently place it in the oil and repeat this for all of your prawns now only cook them for a minute that's all they need and then place them onto some paper towel or a wire rack so the excess oil can drain and this is what you get guys absolutely beautiful and now I'm going to quickly make up what has to be one of the world's easiest dipping sauces just take 4 parts of mirin and one part soy sauce and give it a quick mix serve this alongside the prawns and enjoy there you have a guy's absolutely awesome be sure to give this one a go they are brilliant thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time
