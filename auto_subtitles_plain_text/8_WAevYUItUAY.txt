 hi I'm Larry this is total outdoor programming and today we're going to talk about grilling another one of my really favorite things to grill is bratwurst if like me there are times that you don't think far enough ahead and you have to buy frozen bratwurst again the bun warmer is perfect put your frozen brats up on the bun warmer close your lid and in about five to eight minutes they will be pretty well fought and then you can start cooking them near the fire I never ever put brats over the fire directly I use the indirect method because I want them to cook slow and be more flavorful also turn them often you don't want them cooking real fast and getting burned on the outside I believe the most important thing to remember when you cook abroad is not to pierce the skin that'll not only cause a flame up in your fire but it'll dry the meat out and make them tough people will say oh yes is a terrible rot when it maybe have been a good one especially from one of your local folks who makes them fresh and you'll just have a lot better Brock don't break the skin number one don't use your fork to turn the brats over use the tongs don't grip them real tightly when you turn them over because the tongs can break the skin when I'm cooking brats I will normally close the lid for a minute minute and a half at a time when I know they're safely not near where the fire is because that X more like an oven din and gets the heat around them quicker I think that to make a good broth it will usually take 15 to 20 minutes because you want to cook them slowly often you can start your brats first and then do your hamburgers or your hot dogs after that if you're doing a mixed grill for a family half bratwurst or pork products who want to remember they need to be cooked to 165 degrees internal temperature have a meat thermometer to check them with when I'm going to serve abroad I don't use hot dog buns I use broth funds it's a big piece of meat put it on a big bun I use again I love mustard and onions and then I try to have a small cast-iron skillet that I'll use and I'll fry sauerkraut right in that skillet over the flame while the brats are cooking and then I'll put sauerkraut on my breath I'm Larry this has been total outdoor programming keep on grilling and it'll get better and better all the time you
