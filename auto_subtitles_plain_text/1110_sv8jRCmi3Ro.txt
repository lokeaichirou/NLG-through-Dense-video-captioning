 hi guys how are you today today's recipe is really really delicious it's a version of tabbouleh using roasted bulgur and tons and tons of one of my very favorite herbs parsley I can't wait to share it with you the first thing that you need to do though is roast three pints of cherry tomatoes these aren't actually cherry tomatoes they're grape tomatoes that's okay to just slice them in half look at all those Tomatoes doesn't that look good spread the tomatoes out on a rimmed baking sheet they're gonna fill a hole rimmed baking sheet and then drizzle with about five teaspoons of oil give or take you know me I'll probably go a little bit more heavy-handed but you can use five teaspoons I love olive oil and I think it's really good for you and this is a Mediterranean recipe so it should have plenty of oil sprinkle with salt and just give it a shake or toss it up and then the other thing that makes this recipe really special besides the roasted tomatoes is roasted bulgur so I have one cup of bulgur and I'm putting that on a smaller baking sheet the tomatoes and the bulgur both go into a 450 degree oven tomatoes for 30 minutes bulgur for about 15 normally use just a plain bulgur that's simmered in water today we're gonna roast it so that it gets a really nice depth of toasty flavor while that stuff starts roasting I'm gonna get my onion ready I have one medium red onion I'm just gonna slice it and then halfway through the tomato roasting I'm going to add this onion I like to remove the core for this so that they fall apart into little slices so slice your red onion into very thin slices it's gonna roast with the tomatoes for about fifteen minutes in the oven I love this recipe because it takes sort of a classic light salad and gives it a lot of depth of flavor by roasting all the ingredients except the parsley parsley does not get roasted and here we have my favorite ingredient what makes a tabbouleh a tabbouleh the parsley I have two pretty big bunches of flat leaf parsley well washed well dried I beg of you if ever there's a time to wash and really well dry your parsley it's when you're making tabbouleh if you don't and it's soggy you'll be so so sad and you'll say Sara implored me implored me to wash and dry my parsley really well and they didn't do it now I understand why it's because I love you I'm just telling you once you have your big huge pile of parsley then you want to coarsely chop it's this pile is so big I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to chop it I'm chopping and chopping and chopping the pile is definitely getting smaller if you have a food processor and you want to do this in your food processor that's totally cool just don't over process it you're not looking for a pesto texture here you want a coarse chop okay that looks good I'm gonna add the onions to the tomatoes now and get the bulgur out of the oven bulgur out and then to the tomatoes add the onion add your onion to the tomatoes stir it around and then back in the oven for about 15 minutes tomatoes and the onions go back in for about 15 more minutes and while that's finishing cooking you can cook your bulgur it's been roasted for flavor and now it needs to simmer in two cups of water for about 15 minutes to hydrate my tomatoes and onions are out of the oven once the bulgur has cooked for 15 minutes just let it cool off a little bit and I've combined that with one can of drained chickpeas just a little bit of extra protein now it's just time to combine everything take your tomatoes onions combine it with your chickpeas and bulgur this is a really really hearty tabbouleh almost I would venture to say a main course to bully so add your tomatoes and onions to the chickpeas and bulgur and then all your parsley probably like a cup and a half of parsley you know that's making me happy is it gonna make you happy so and then a tablespoon of olive oil give or take salt and then lemon juice to taste salt and lemon juice are relate to taste so I'm gonna start with a half a lemon and see where that goes I bet I'll need more but you never know you don't want to overdo it right but this is a big salad stir it up look at that hearty lunch dinner I don't know breakfast I think this is a platter worthy dish what about you make sure you taste it in just for seasoning to your liking if you want to add a little bit of feta cheese to this and make it unbeaten go ahead this recipe makes plenty for tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch so save some pack it up and take it to the office and watch everybody be super jealous where'd you get the recipe Sara gave it to me and let me tell you roasting the bulgur really does make a difference you can skip that step bicycles but why bother I'm going to eat this whole bladder healthy happy and hearty it's fantastic Oh guys fantastic Oh you
