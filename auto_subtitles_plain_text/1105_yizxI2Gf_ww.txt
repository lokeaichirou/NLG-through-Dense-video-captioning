 welcome to cinemas kitchen and today I have very simple in a very easy recipe of butter naan and I'm cooking this without any thunder or oven so let's get started for the naan we need all-purpose flour salt to taste water to knead the dough sugar oil yogurt and yeast so here in a bowl I'm going to put two and half cups of all-purpose flour add 1 TSP sugar 1/2 2 TSP oil and yeast we're going to put it right into the floor and salt to taste and quarter cup of plain yogurt at room temperature make sure it's at room temperature now I'm going to knead the dough using the KitchenAid stand mixer add a little water at a time and also make sure the water is a little bit lukewarm it will help the dough rise faster we want to make a soft dough on softer than normal ciabatta Atta now take the dough out in a separate bowl and let it rise leave it for 30 to 40 minutes in a warm place so after 30 minutes you can see the dough is almost double in the size and now we are ready to prepare the nun so grease your palms with a little bit of oil to prevent the dough from sticking and take a desired amount depending on how big or small you want the naan to be and now dip it in a loose flour and we are going to roll it with the help of rolling pin sprinkle some loose flour if it's sticking now heat a pan or griddle and we are going to put the nan on the griddle and keep it on a medium heat cover it and let it cook for about two to three minutes now as you can see it's it has a lot of bubbles so it is puffing up just fine now the one side is done for the other side I'm just going to flip it over the flame directly the keeping it a little bit above the flame so it doesn't burn but pops up right so keep flipping it over until it's nicely done so the naan is ready now top it off with the butter if you want to make a garlic naan just spread a garlic paste and sprinkle some fresh coriander but for my butter naan I'm just going to sprinkle some kasoori methi for extra flavor and here the naan is ready enjoy it with your favourite curry thank you for watching
