 [Music] hello my name is Helen rainy and today I'll show you how to poach eggs I have a slotted spoon here and I'm going to prop up its handle on some big object to keep it flat on a plate let's crack an egg and loot and see what's inside obviously there is the yolk the interesting part is that there are two types of white there is the white that looks like this serious congestion snot the kind you need sudafed for and there is the way that looks like a runny nose snot the very thin paper the runny nose white is the kind that causes problems during poaching the best way to deal with it is to remove it before the egg goes in the pot wait a few seconds for the thin white to drip off wipe the underside of the spoon and pour the egg into a small ramekin or cup I have a 2 quart pot but slightly more than 2 inches of water here which is the minimum we need for poaching let's season that the paste with salt and bring to a boil once you get a boil turn down your pot to very low the water should be barely simmering take a spoon and stir the water to create a vortex it doesn't need to be a violent vortex input two revolutions of the spoon per second as soon as I'll stop stirring I'll bring my cup with the egg to the very surface of the water and boom the egg leads to go into the pot in one fast motion or the yolk might lose the white the reason we need the vortex is to wrap the white around the yolk and give the beautiful cut that shape it also helps the white coagulant faster when a cold air gov fully oven 70 degrees goes into a 200 degree water the water immediately around the egg goes off when you make the water move new hot waters washed over the egg constantly helping the white coagulate it works just like the convection fan in your oven when the egg just starts to set about 30 seconds that goes into the pot I stir the water gently around it until it lets go of the bottom this one wasn't there once that but it never hurts to stir the pot a bit note how the water is not bubbling at all by now not even the tiniest bubble if he's used thermometer to check it it should stay under 200 to keep the white tender we need to keep things just below a simmer the total cooking time for an egg varies between three and five minutes depending on how much water you have in the pot how much work you drained off and how well done you like you yolks I like my yolks runny and a large egg in a small pot we'll get there in about four minutes let's get our egg out with a spatula we clean slotted spoon and put it on a paper towel to dry let's cook one more egg first cover your path to return it to a simmer otherwise the timing will be unpredictable when the water starts to bubble turn it down and stir with practice you could forego dirtying aramitan and drop the egg right from the slotted spoon into the water you I have 30 seconds to go with this egg but I want to warm up my first egg so I'll return it to the pot here we go - beautiful eggs both at perfect temperature if some further eight pieces of white are bothering you you can trim them off I think I'll have lunch now from Hell's Kitchen in Boston happy cooking and baking the year [Music]
