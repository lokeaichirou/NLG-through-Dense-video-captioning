 welcome back to videojug and the food for all series my name is Pippa author of the intolerant gourmet and in this episode I'm going to show you how to make gluten-free dairy-free egg-free baked falafel in lettuce bitter with maple tahini dressing first step of this recipe is all really simple we're going to use a food processor and we're just going to blitz it all together and that takes any of the faff out of finally chopping the chickpeas so we have a tin of chickpeas drained and rinsed we place those into the food processor next is two teaspoons of garlic oil I like to use garlic oil because it's got a subtler flavor than raw garlic cloves and and as you're just going to bake this from fresh it makes a real difference and we've got half a red onion roughly chopped just throw it in there and a little bit again roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley for a full list of ingredients just check the description box and next we're going to add 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder this just helps give the falafel a tiny little bit of which is what you want and then we've got a mixture of herbs and spices or spices we've got smoked paprika which adds a lovely smoky flavor we've got cumin and we've got coriander and a pinch of sea salt finally we add two teaspoons of your favorite sauce this can be chili jam or it could be tahini or it could be a hot sauce it's whatever you favor it just adds a nice bit of depth and flavor it won't overpower the falafel but it's a nice addition and then we just pulse it you want the chickpeas to become really finely chopped you might have to scrape down the sides that points just to make sure that everything's binding together you wanted to be a paste but with a bit of texture so a court case would be a good description and as I said we'll just scrape down the sides that's just to make sure that you've got any loose bits and pieces mixed in then one last clip you'll be able to smell already the spice mixture which although really simple is got a great kind of Ottoman like Moroccan Persian flavor so we get a mixing bowl and we'll just wipe down the blade get that out of the way and take the falafel paste which is what it is at the moment and just scrape it in the next step is so incredibly easy you just want to bind your falafel mixture so you're adding a flat but obviously we want gluten-free flour and this is where gram flour comes in gram flour chickpea flour you can use it to make soccer which is a French bread and you can also use it in pancake mixtures or baking but of course it's perfect for falafel because it's chickpeas and tickets so we take our gram flour I'd say three to four tablespoons but it really depends on how much moisture is in your chickpeas and how moist the mixture is so you want it to be bound together so we'll start with three and then stir together and see what kind of texture it is you just want it to still help be slightly tacky but hold together nicely so that you can shape it into little patties and for this recipe we're going to bake the falafel which isn't your usual option normally we fry fluffle and you could do with this mixture as well but I prefer to do in the oven I think it's got a nice flavor and although looks a little less golden tastes just as delicious so that's four table spoons of gram flour and then you'll see that the mixture is holding together but still a paste and this is about right we're taking about a walnut sized amount and we're just going to you'll see that it's quite tacky that's totally fine if you have a problem with it just all your hands with a little bit of olive oil and that will help them slide off and again we're going to put them on an oiled baking tray to cook so to shape it into a little ball and then place it on your baking tray and you can flatten it slightly but really you just want them to be like little mini patties and they won't spread when you bake them so you can put them quite place together so I'm just going to carry on making these falafel until we've used all the mixture up put it on the baking tray and then it's into the oven at 200 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes so our falafel are out of the oven they've been in there around 30 minutes and I flip them over halfway through just so that they Brown evenly you'll see that they brown top to bottom rather than around the edges but it's all crisp because of the gram flour inside them so we'll let those cool for a little bit and then we're going to make our tahini maple dressing so in this bowl I've got a really simple mixture of maple syrup and he knead into that we're going to add the juice of half a lemon and depending on the size or the juiciness of your lemons you can add a little bit more a little bit less dressings or sauces are so much to your own taste so trust your instinct if you like the way it tastes and the texture then go with that so stir the lemon juice in just until it's combined and then we have about a tablespoon of garlic oil and again that adds a really nice it's intense garlic but it doesn't burn you like raw garlic would so it's a good combination to have and just stir that through until it's all emulsified oh there's our tahini maple dressing made you can see it's really glossy and thick and perfect for going into the lettuce pitter with the falafel so play two or three of the bait falafel into your lettuce cup let's do three for this and if you have any chopped tomato or chopped avocado or extra fresh herbs you can add those at this point the more color the better really grated beetroot all sorts and then we spoon over a little bit of the tahini and maple dressing which acts as a kind of source for your pitter and then you have if I show you you curve up the lettuce cups like this and you have a ready-made pitter for your falafel or for kebabs or a burger perfect summertime food I'm going to go and enjoy this and hope to see you next time in the food for all series you
