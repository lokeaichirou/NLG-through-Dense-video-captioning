 welcome to huffington post my name is Thea Randall and this is my recipe for the weekend now I'm going to cook today we get to carbonara which I think it's one of those dishes that everyone has a sort of theory or philosophy behind and for me the most important thing about spaghetti carbonara is the quality of the ingredients so really good quality spaghetti I mean by the sort of the best spaghetti you can afford to buy good eggs I mean these are Italian eggs and the chickens we've got a diet of corn and carrots and they're specifically reared for pasta because they've got this amazing yolk because of the carotene the carrot it's very very almost orange like and then I've got some really good quality pancetta which is a dry cure it's not smoked it's got this kind of amazing amount of fat on it but when you fry it it's absolute delicious and then of course we can have some parmigiana me you could use a pecorino but parmesan with the egg and the pancetta is delicious there's no cream in this recipe you know carbonara with cream is you know it's not really how it should be done Koni a black pepper as well so first of all we'll get a hot pan well actually first of all cook our spaghetti so the whole dish shouldn't take longer than the spaghetti cook now this is probably going to take on the packets in about ten minutes we're gonna cook about eight and we're just going to finish up the cooking with a bit of the cooking water and the eggs and the pancetta and parmesan so we'll put this in now so while that's cooking we're going to get our pancetta so nice thin strips of pancetta and then nice hot pan no need any oil in the pan because this has got so much fat this pancetta we always wanted to make it kind of dry and crispy so in it goes the hot pan and then just get that all that fat to sort of render out and while that's going on we're going to separate our eggs you need quite a lot of egg in this seat from one portion I do at least two yolks and then when I say portion I mean it's sort of small starter portion so make sure is no white in there just the yolk - they're quite small so they do three so three yolks keep the whites for something else and then just keep you on that pancetta we don't to be - don't want to be black we always just want to cut most golden the colour I'm really crispy look how much fat comes out it's incredible but there's so much flavor and the kind of the fatty of the pancetta usually the crispier it goes and just put that onto a towel drain off any of the excess fat get everyone that fat anymore spell its purpose okay so just going to sort of feet are a goes together add a little bit of seasoning black pepper and then we just wait for our spaghetti to cook so we take our pasta and ice cook so nice chewiness to it so add it to our seasoned egg yolks with a bit of that cooking water don't worry about getting rid of the cooking water in and then using that hot pasta start moving the eggs and the pasta together and the hot pasta will cook the egg yolk let's wait any cream then we're gonna add some Parmesan cheese user pork have used tongs you get all the nice bit stuck in the tongs so just use your fork and then this point it means start to get a bit thick add some the pasta cooking water so get a pasta cooking water and then just sort of bring that all together add the pancetta leave some for the top and then it's like a nice little bit of good olive oil in there as well get all those nice bits on the side and then nice small portion the carbonara anymore pancetta a little bit more parmesan and then just finish off with a little bit more beautiful black pepper and there you have a delicious authentic spaghetti carbonara
