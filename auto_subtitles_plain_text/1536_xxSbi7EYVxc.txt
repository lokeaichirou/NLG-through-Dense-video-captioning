 welcome i'm Deronda with foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to make one of the freshest Caesar salads you've ever had now to get this salad together you really want to start with the freshest romaine lettuce you want about 10 to 12 bite-sized pieces of your romaine lettuce now here's a head of romaine lettuce and what I do is I cut about and about an inch or two off the end and I separate each leaf and I rinse it under fresh clean running water and shake out the excess water and dry it really well and store it in the refrigerator till ready to use because you want it nice and crispy and crunchy and chilled all right you're going to need 1/2 a cup of olive oil 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise if you don't want to use mayonnaise use 1 egg yolk that I chose to use mayonnaise in place of the egg yolk today I've got a teaspoon of Dijon mustard 1 fresh lemon two garlic cloves that I'm going to mince 2 anchovies I got fresh Parmesan cheese here that I'm going to grate and add to this salad I've got a cup or two of croutons depending on how many croutons you winning your Caesar salad I'm going to leave it up to you to choose and I'm going to add a few drops of your Worcestershire sauce or maybe up to one teaspoon and for flavoring and taste I'm going to do salt and pepper here at the end so let me show you how we're going to get this dressing started to make your garlic you're going to take a knife you're going to put it here on your garlic cloves and you're going to give it a nice smacking with the back of your hands okay and then you'll see how your garlic paper is just going to peel off and you're going to have this lovely fresh garlic if you have any little brown spots right there you can go ahead and remove them with your knife be sure you cut away from yourself the last thing you want to do is cut yourself and then I go ahead and remove the ends like this not necessary but I like mine really nice and clean just like that and now we're going to start mincing it and keep going back and forth with your knife till you have a fine mince on your garlic we've got our garlic finely minced see how fine that is and we're going to add it to this large mixing bowl and I've got a glass mixing bowl I'm using but if you have a real beautiful wooden bow you'd like to use you may do that too and now with the end Chubby's we're going to go in here and we're going to remove - these are packed in oil you can use in so these that are packed in salt and actually that's why I was trying to find use but had no luck so we're going to remove two anchovies here there's one mmm hey this little can was fun to open - there's two now with the back of a fork we're going to just smash it in to that garlic okay and the reason you want to do this in your bowl is because when you start releasing all these oils you want to be sure to keep them in the bowl so they can absorb in your romaine lettuce when you get ready to toss it you see how your garlic and your anchovies has worked into this really fine paste or like a puree that's what you're looking for now we're going to add the mayonnaise to it okay and like I said if you want to add the egg yolk instead of mayonnaise by all means do that that will thicken it up and then using my baby spatula here I'm going to use going to add that Dijon mustard and that Dijon mustard is going to make all the difference in the world and I use the champagne flavour but if you just have the regular on hand as absolutely perfectly fine I'm going to add a few drops of that Worcestershire sauce I would say no more than a half a teaspoon that looks perfect and now to this we're going to start whisking in that olive oil with my handy dandy whisk I'm going to slowly add a nice stream of olive oil you know Cardini Caesar but just kind of a history behind this salad he was an immigrant from Italy and he opened restaurants here in America and down in Mexico and I guess when one has it that this was a salad he was serving in his restaurant around you know the 4th of July when the US was celebrating its own independence all right see how lovely and thick that skidding that's what you're looking for oh my gosh absolutely fantastic and if you could be in my kitchen right now and smell how delicious it is we're going to add that fresh lemon right into our dressing and I love this lemon squeezer you can squeeze limes lemons these are little lemons so I'm using the wine part of my squeezer here make sure you get it all out and then of course I've got a little bit more here I'm going to add a little mercy I've been grading that Parmesan cheese in there and I'm using a fine grater and we're going to add about a half a cap and here's my 1/2 cup we're going to add to it and we're doing we're just going to whisk this in to the dressing all right yeah I'm going to show you how we're going to put the lettuce in it for the romaine lettuce you just want to stack it on top like this and with a chef's knife I cut it down the center once and if you'd like to tear it into bite-sized pieces you may do that too and then I just take my knife and I begin to cut it just like this and if you have pieces that are a little too big by all means you can tear it into the size you're looking for like this I'm just going to tear that apart and now we're going to edit over here until our Caesar dressing oh my goodness then when we get all the lettuce in there I'm going to show you how I'm going to give it a little of Lea little tossing but you want to continue cutting apart your romaine lettuce and oh my goodness this is going to be so fresh and delicious I just can't wait all right I'll be back to show you how we're gonna toss it looky at all that beautiful romaine and look about the dressing on the bottom now we're going to give it this lovely tossing this is my favorite part and we're going to coat all this romaine lettuce as you can see it's coming together ooh oh my it's so fresh I've got that fresh lemon I'm picking up on and I've got the ooh flavors of the anchovies and the olive oil and the romaine lettuce along with that lovely delicious Parmesan cheese okay now for the croutons this is the time we're going to add the croutons because we want the croutons to start absorbing that dressing and if you want to know how to make fresh croutons check out the link I've added below this food video and watch on how to make French croutons there's nothing better than fresh croutons alright that looks absolutely perfect now I'm going to add a little fresh cracked pepper okay fresh cracked mix all the difference in the world okay and a little kosher salt a lab a little bit of kosher salt not much just a little bit and if you opt out of it that's fine too and now really to make this lovely and presentable take that block of Parmesan cheese and take you a vegetable peeler and just peel you some strips of that Parmesan cheese hearing your salad before serving or put it on individual dishes and shave a little fresh Parmesan cheese on the top of your salad oh my goodness it's going to be absolutely heavenly all right I'll be back I'm going to show you how serve it and I'll give it a taste and tell you what it's like Oh My heavens is this going to be delicious so nice and fresh looky there oh my goodness this is like a mill in itself now if you'd like take that block of parmesan and just gray just some lovely fresh cheese on the top add some fresh crushed pepper a few more croutons if you wish and let's dig in so I'm going to tell you what it's like mmm looky there mmm you won't go wrong with this Caesar salad mr.
