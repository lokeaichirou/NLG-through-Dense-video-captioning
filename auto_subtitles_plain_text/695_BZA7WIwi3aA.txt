 hi everybody Brittany welcome to my kitchen so today I'm going to be making one of my favorite dishes it's penne alla vodka this is vodka cream tomato sauce it's very popular in New York this recipe was given to me by a close friend of mine I changed a little bit of it today I'm not going to be using prosciutto although normally I would put prosciutto or pinch up in it and normally there's going to be sweet basil in it so it's going to be great and I hope you give it a try so so the ingredients we're going to be needing today are some freshly grated cheese I'm using pecorino romano today you can use Locatelli whatever you have some vodka some garlic some heavy cream some crushed red chili flakes some tomato paste one of the large cans of tomatoes you can either use pureed tomatoes or whole tomatoes I like whole some butter some olive oil some salt and fresh basil make sure you use sweet Italian basil I don't have basil today so I'm not putting it in but if you have it that would be great it really makes the sauce wonderful so thank you gonna start by getting a pen nice and hot and you're going to put some olive oil in the pan after that you're going to add about five cloves of garlic slice and also some crushed red chili flakes to taste I like a pretty spicy and at this point normally you would add prosciutto you would add about five slices of prosciutto that you had chopped I can't get prosciutto in Taiwan I can get it but it's not great quality and it's really really expensive so I just rather not even put it in you can also use pancetta although I wouldn't use American bacon because American bacon is smoked and you don't want that smoky flavor in your alla vodka sauce okay so once your garlic is nice and fragrant you're going to add some tomato paste I'm going to add about four tablespoons I'm just eyeballing it okay so I just waited about two minutes for my for my tomato paste to get nice and caramelized in the olive oil and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add my whole tomatoes and I'm going to crush them with my hands because that's what I like to do that's what I've always done like I said before you can use pureed tomatoes you can use diced tomatoes it's really just about preference so here goes [Music] okay so I have my tomatoes crushed and the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of sugar because I tasted the sauce and it's a little acidic so I'm just going to add like a little handful of sugar not too much and I'm also going to add some salt and now I'm going to bring this to a boil and then I'm going to reduce the heat to low and I'm going to let it cook for about 45 minutes so I'll see you back okay so the sauce has been simmering for about 45 minutes I checked for seasoning for salt for sugar and now what we're going to do is we're going to add the vodka the heavy cream the butter and the cheese okay so this is a pretty fattening dish but it's really good so you just add the busca right in and you're going to add 3/4 cups of heavy cream okay you're going to add in about a half a cup of cheese and this is freshly grated pecorino romano try to get good quality cheese and you are going to add in about two tablespoons of butter so give that all a mix and you're going to let this simmer bring it to a boil and then reduce it to low cover it and simmer it for another 20 minutes and then it should be ready okay so it's been about 25 minutes and my sauce is done I checked too I gave it a taste and made sure that all the vodka was cooked out of it so there's no more alcohol flavor you're just left with this really nice very rich smooth sauce and then the last thing you have to do is you just bring your penne pasta or rigatoni pasta whatever you prefer to a boil and you add it and you top it off with some grated cheese and you're ready to go so I'll be back for the plating I didn't really think I was going to follow
