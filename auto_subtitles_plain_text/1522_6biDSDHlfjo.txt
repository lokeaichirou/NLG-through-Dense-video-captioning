 they're introducing improvements and jitka boots Quezada and my name is her fighting Sookie and here to show you when Java code but lots of requests yep why don't you choke the janitor and Here I am today to show you how to make Punjabi - to begin with I've got this chick peas we call it totally in India the white toilet and internationally people know this as Japan juice so chickpeas or their banjos here soak overnight preferably overnight which means before sleeping just soak this in water go to sleep so what I'm going to do this in India we all prefer to cook to lay in a pressure cooker so throw a little bit the water into the treasure I like these bright metal things I personally had to do three of them and some of these right who's ready the Amla into the Tolen teabags and salt as per taste now like this and cook cook until this is absolutely soft now the test is you know that it should get pressed easily in between two fingers is it or you should hit it against someone and this please should get stuck so that's when you know your toll ours are absolutely Oh so this one is nice and soft cook well then you see this black color that you've got it's because of the tea leaves it's also a little dark because of the try mango fellatio the dry mango seems that he had added it's because of that and the gooseberries of course these all add the nice tart thing that you get here take a pan now put this pan on fire pour some oil by the what it gets for what should we do of course some onion here let's cut this onion into cubes I saw these people independent they make this beautiful now they don't slice onions in Delhi I find me chefs who do this anywhere they would slice the other what the ghouls raw kind of grind this up putting it in a blender to this add green chillies [Music] drawn bow tie piece to this pomegranate seeds so one teaspoon of ripe pomegranate seeds into this mixture not grind to a fine paste it's really close here the oil spot to this cinnamon stick one inch pieces two numbers green cardamom photo five of them Klaus Porou five of them one is nice and hot the onion mixture I'm here mr. James will be auto ended beautiful spices yeah now onions are kind of done here one tablespoon of garlic paste 1 tablespoon of ginger place for some more time you know the judgment would be with the time you see the role evils of ginger garlic no more now how do you judge raw flavors of ginger and garlic generally didn't valid have any sharp bluish very sharp so when you add to auto I owe myself like this what happens kind of moving out and what do you see that for some time three four minutes of stir frying oil there's the flavors of the onions to this mixture I've got red tomato puree so this is unit from fresh tomatoes four five Tomatoes drum or fine paste in goes it tomorrow fury here I'll cook again tended all flavors of chemicals are absolutely God now in case you get canned tomatoes which are plants and can you don't need to cook for a long time because they're normally cook didn't get any food that we do we keep cooking to a particular texture flavor actually till it achieves that texture flavor you and that's something which comes with experience IV so you cook this for nearly three to four minutes cover it up keeps kitchen target so let this get go for some time the chickpeas here I bought the cheap food water what happens is when you bring the chickpeas do not throw this water this will attack the body off the cream and it's nice and wrong I've got some ginger here let me cut this into fine tune it ten slices these come only when you have a sharp knife cut it into two games keep this society fine comes an empath experience so when you cut please be careful even if the night this shop might cut your finger some green chillies here slip them off remove the seeds put three of them not much all the hotness in the beach peace out let me check the mixture Wow now I see the point separated from the tomato paste that's when you know that it matters are for to this mixture where I am going to do this add all the dry spices the spirit chili powder 1tsp to like it hot and spicy and more I've got some holy Mossad now this is some ready-made truly masala which in the market please buy it and use a tablespoon of this make it anymore one and a half tablespoon and this is roasted jeera powder one teaspoon of roasted jeera how do we do this salt to taste keep stirring now give a stir here after adding the spices cook it for some time because you need the spices to get for an Indian cooking actually what's important is after you add each ingredient you need to cook it for some time each ingredient has been extracted you need to extract the flavors from each ingredient and particular texture before you add the next but if you want everything together then I think it's not the kind of cooking video that's when you are enough for it so if you want to quit me probably you do that but if you want to make it with love then you need to put each ingredient and do it the way I am doing here okay once the oil is separated next engraving should wood so what is the next ingredient I've got my Taniya pull us into this and the water this is what a lot of water will not add all of this mix it nicely give it a stir let me just taste this salt your foot now let's cover this and let it cook for around eight to ten minutes by then what's more happen is the tool as you know the techniques they've got to get home some of them we get masked and add the that's the beauty of a good tool so let it go let the sum of the two lines get backs and you get a clear picture of the day so we'll win for eight to ten minutes for this to get go now after about 10 to 15 minutes what you need to do is check this some of these two lads as you see are poor and some of them are master so this gives a nice thick texture to the cleaning and I love touch texture finally order is another we invert this Torian company first ill-fated I only add ghee clarified butter so who in sake everybody tells me that totally off quality whether there's any above it they love to leave that and that's because they make it when you keep I like this to temperate finally so that at least and move on me and I don't cook completely ready finally even temperate regime and you serve it immediately here's the key to this I add when hold it they kind of create drop cats so this is an antique to that so you need to add a to end to any kind of chickpeas that you weigh so he mice and hot here the julienne ginger and chilies [Music] remove this and just throw this into this mixer beautiful play this is my personal favorite and if you do it like this I bet the taste kind of caboose ah and that's what I try and teach everybody how to cook better and better each day now Sola is ready you could serve it with the titties that you make you know the parameter keys serve it with that or serve it to us but just need to take this do it the way I am doing you will never be some good cooking
