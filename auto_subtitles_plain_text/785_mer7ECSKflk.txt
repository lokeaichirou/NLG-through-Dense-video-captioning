 all right let's make our marinade for our carne asada got half a cup of beer juice from one lime one and a half tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce two cloves of garlic that I've sliced up and some freshly ground black pepper about a quarter teaspoon all right got my skirt steak here this is about a pound and a quarter and all I'm gonna do is I'm going to cut it up into some manageable pieces I'm cooking this on the hibachi grill so I don't have a lot of room to work with so I'm just going to cut this and like four pieces all right so after we get our skirt steak cut up we're going to put it in this bag I want to make sure you got plenty of room here for adding your marinade anyway we're just going to throw our marinade in here and we're going to massage this we're going to put it in the refrigerator for two three hours and everybody every half hour we'll go by turn it over and then we'll put it back in the fridge and I'm just going to push out most of the air before I completely seal this up and about 1 hour before we throw the meat on the grill we're going to take it out of the refrigerator and let's just start to warm up and don't forget we need to take the salsa out too and let it warm up all right hibachi grills ready and we're going to put this meat on here fat side down so that we can put most of that off all right now that we've got a good sear on this fat layer we're going to move these things off to one side and in case you guys are curious this is a custom yakitori grill it's made by Manuel of El rabbits barbecue I will put a link to his Facebook page and the about or show more information and you guys can follow the link and get in touch with him if you're interested in having one he can make it any length that you want this grill cooks nice it gets hot but it's not super hot it's got a nice steady temperature just perfect for doing stuff like this anyway I'm putting on here what they call Mexican onions they're actually immature e onions and I'm going to put a couple serrano peppers on here as well we're going to kind of muster this up and after our onions and peppers get all blistered up which will take them off the grill a pretty self-explanatory look at here all right make some room for cooking our tortillas we're going to move this meat to one end of the grill all right on this end we're going to put a couple tortillas and we're going to just put some spots on both sides 'evil and then whenever they get some spots on both sides we're going to take them off and we're going to tint them in some aluminum foil now to help them steam keep them nice and not flexible and we're going to keep cooking these until we have all we need and when our meats cooked to the desired doneness we're going to take it off the grill and let it rest for a few minutes alright it's time to cut up our meat I notice the grains running this direction we're going to do our first cut that same direction all right now a final cut is going to be against the grain and that will help keep the meat nice and tender for our tacos alright first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna put some guacamole on our tacos and then we're going to put some of our grilled skirt steak on here alright now we're going to add some of our taquerias style salsa a little bit spicy but it's not too bad alright we're going to put a little diced onion on these things alright I'm putting some cilantro in here I know some people hate it but I happen to love it I guess it's one of those love-hate things and they really make these things pop I'm gonna squeeze a little fresh lime juice on here into our plate we're gonna put one of our onions in one of our serrano chiles just for a little fire alright and to taste these tacos I have my beautiful daughter Annabelle here and I had to say that because daddy cooks did a really nice job of introducing his daughter in a video and somebody saw it it reminded me I've never said anything nice about her own camera zactly oh okay see what I gotta put up with that anyway she's going to taste our tacos for us and let us know what she thinks this beautiful daughter will accept just taco that's all I'm gonna get
