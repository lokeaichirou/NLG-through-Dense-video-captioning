 all right I have harvested all my cabbage I'm very excited to make what I call German sauerkraut so what I've done is I peeled off the outer leaves here and won't be using those for the sauerkraut then I've got the cabbage heads I cut them in half and then I core them take this core out then I quarter them then what I do of course these are rinsed I put them over here in the slicer Dicer machine let me show you what blade I'm using it's this blade here it has actually two different sides on I'm using the thicker of the two sides just a long blade on it that's the thick side and that's the thin side so I have to pick your side up this is a Bosch mixer it's wonderful this great job also has the blender on this side but anyway so I take the cabbage head take the mat push her out turn it on I need a girl smaller cabbages okay so then I'll process the whole head like that I'll take this out and dump it into this four gallon bucket any bucket size will work and then I have of course our Himalayan crystal salt and I'm going to sprinkle that in here just I'm not measuring anything using the spoon as a device to spread it out and that has come in here and I'm just kind of turning it around so the salt gets on everything what's going to happen is the salt draws the water out of the cabbage and will make a puddle in here you can see actually down I don't know if you can actually see the water collecting here but to there's some of the water right there and it's been going up quite a bit since I've been doing this so I just kind of mash it up here mix it up when I have all the cabbage mixed in here with the salt water don't have any other spices in here then I'll get a plate and I'll put the plate on top of here if there isn't enough water to cover the cabbage I'll add some more water to it I'll put the plate in and then I'll put a weight on top of the plate and that will keep everything submerged underneath the water then I just leave it on the counter for two weeks I'll come back in two weeks I'll taste it if it tastes right to me then I'll will dump the salt water out rinse it off and we have awesome tasting German cabbage my wife will cook up some sourdough bread and we'll have that for just snacking on during the day or for dinner the difference between German sauerkraut and American sauerkraut is that German sauerkraut is fermented an American sauerkraut is that made with vinegar which is very bitter I don't like the American sauerkraut at all I've spent a lot of time in Germany and I like the mild flavor of the German sauerkraut so you can do this with this cabbage heads that you get from the grocery store very easy to do sauerkraut is a great probiotic so if you want to strengthen your digestive system have some sauerkraut or make your own sauerkraut anyway and so we're going to be a long two weeks so I can eat this I love it I'll rinse it and then keep it in the refrigerator it'll probably last in the refrigerator to two to three or four weeks it probably won't last that long in this household because I love eating it this is LDS prepper reminding you if you are prepared you shall not fear and if you get a couple heads of cabbage you can make your own sauerkraut with a little bit of thyme and a little bit of salt
