 hi guys hopefully all here doing well today I'm going to show you how to make a simple weeknight staple and that is just a simple meatloaf we're gonna do both a beef and a turkey version and in the midst of all of that I'm going to show you also how to cut a recipe in half so for those of you who have smaller families or it's just a couple you can make a smaller meatloaf and you don't have to worry about making a big two-pound meatloaf for just two people or maybe even four check it out see if you like it and if I need to I can also do a video on how I cut recipes in half if you guys think it's necessary but take a look first off we're going to start the recipe by dicing some bell peppers and onions and they were going to saute them off and a little bit of olive oil cook the onions and the bell peppers for about five to eight minutes or until the onions are nice and translucent and just before they get done we're going to add our chopped garlic now you're not going to see that happen because I'm going to show you how to save his recipe regardless of an absent mind the next thing we're going to add is our spices I'm adding some paprika and some dried thyme this is your chance to use some of those dried herbs that probably need to be used anyway so go ahead and take the opportunity to do that these two work really well together in this recipe and as soon as they hit the hot oil you can smell them immediately this is a good way to always wake up your dried herbs now as far as ground beef we're going to be using ground chuck and that means it's 80/20 80% meat and 20% fat which is going to give you a great moist result for our meal let's talk about what goes inside the meatloaf I'm going to be using some panko breadcrumbs you can use whatever breadcrumbs you like I'm going to be using some heavy cream but you could also use milk we have a beaten egg and I'm also going to put in some worchestershire sauce which if you don't have you can add some steak sauce which is a nice substitute for that I'm going to be adding salt and pepper to taste and of course I'm going to add some Grand Diamond all-purpose seasoning which you can get at Gd seasoning calm remember this recipe you can use any type of seasoning you want again look in your cupboard and use what you have the last ingredient that I'm going to add is some beef broth that I had on hand and I just wanted to add a little bit to the meat just because I was being a little extra but this is optional on the recipe you do not have to add beef broth the whole point of us sauteing the onions and peppers first was to not only just cook them but give them a few minutes to cool about 10 minutes and after they've cooled then you can go ahead and finally add them to the meatloaf mixture just mix the meatloaf mixture just until it comes together you don't want to overwork the meatloaf once everything is thoroughly mixed then we're going to go ahead and give it a taste how we're going to do that we're going to make a small patty and that's a way of checking what the meatloaf is going to taste like without having to wait to bake the whole thing what you're going to do is take that patty turn right back around and put it in that skillet where we saute the onions and the peppers once it's done give the patty a taste and then adjust your seasonings to your liking now remember I said I forgot the garlic earlier that patty is what reminded me that I have forgotten it so I went ahead and saute it off about three to four cloves of garlic and I was ready to move forward now we're ready to bake off our meatloaf so we're just going to take the meat mixture and shape it into a nice loaf in a baking dish I'm using a nine by eleven you can use a nine by thirteen whatever you have and shape it accordingly as you can see my meatloaf the way is shaped yours may be a little longer or a little shorter that's why when making meatloaf the times may vary so what we're going to do is we're going to bake at 350 degrees until an instant-read thermometer reads 160 degrees start checking the internal temperature of the meatloaf right at the 60 minute mark you should be close to being done by that time so just for kicks I wanted to show you guys a couple of things yes you can cut a recipe in half especially one like this it's a meatloaf so you would take every ingredient and you will cut the measurement in half to get a one-pound meatloaf the second thing I need you to know when you're making a turkey loaf is that turkey is very lean and supposed to be the ground turkey I'm working with here is 93% lean so that means when I sauteed the peppers and the onions I used way more olive oil that way I can return it back into the turkey loaf and I use chicken broth for moisture also as far as the glaze is going to be a mixture of Worchester sauce dijon mustard cayenne pepper and ketchup we're just gonna whisk back together but it's only gonna go on top of the meat lows at the last 15 to 20 minutes of the cooking time so we're in the homestretch now we got 15 and 20 minutes more cooking time so I'm just going to take our ketchup sauce and just pour it right over the meatloaf and just spread it out evenly and the same steps apply for the turkey loaf once the beef meatloaf is done you're going to see how much fat has rendered out and you can actually use a couple of tablespoons of that fat as a base to make a roux in a skillet so that you can make gravy if you wanted to pour gravy over the meatloaf but I just prefer some steamed vegetables and some mashed potatoes or rice and you're good to go so you want to treat this meatloaf like any other large piece of meat and you want to remove it from the cooking dish put it on a plate and then let it rest before you cut into it I don't know why it's taking me so long to put this recipe up but everybody needs a good meatloaf recipe this is your basic one that has lots of flavor and it's easy to make you can even prep the meatloaf the day before and then cook it off when you get home from work and then for those of you who may want to bypass the beef option and go with the turkey it turns out just as moist and flavorful and even more figure friendly thank you guys so much for joining me you know I appreciate it when you come hang out don't forget both of these recipes will be found in the description and you can find them at GDC be calm and I'll see you guys next time
