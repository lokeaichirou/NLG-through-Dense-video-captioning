 Hey welcome to cooking with Steve and Jerry today we're going to show you how to make actual onion rings gonna bread it tastes like and yet you're not okay with the chef the chef put on you today but we're gonna we're going to show you how to make onion rings that tastes like just like what you get at an actual absolute place we can't name them but not popular they'll be better anyway much better cheers Cheers what you're going to need for this recipe it's pretty simple you need onions don't put them in your eyes eat all fry because it'll hurt you it done up all right an egg and egg anyway you're going to need 1 and 1/4 cups of flour that's not wanting 2/3 by the way that's one on one recorder and we're going to need 1 cup of milk to go on with the egg breadcrumbs and a deep fryer set to 365 degrees Fahrenheit however if you don't have a deep fryer you can probably get away with doing this in a really big pot full of oil you could have a fire extinguisher have the fume hood on and make sure you have a first aid kit and a birthday kit booberella cheers Cheers all right ok so first thing you're going to want to do is take a sharp knife and an onion and you're going to want to slice this onion but a quarter-inch thick all the way down don't stick your face too close because you will cry quarter-inch thick about after that you're going to want to separate them into rings door this is a very fun job that's why they're called onion rings and not I mean onion pucks onion are they making you cry yes onions completely separated the onions are done all right so what we're going to need a cup and a quarter of plain white flour you can get it from the food bank and you put that in a mixing bowl okay with that we're going to take a heaping teaspoon of baking soda baking powder baking powder cos I messed that up too baking powder and a teaspoon of salt and it goes any old salt will do okay and we'll mix that all up it looks nice you did wash your hands right you got to take those onion rings and coat them in that flour mixture is we are going to teaching next step okay all right so onions oops onions we're putting a bowl with a lid and we shook him up and coated them in flour mixture and stuff like that so now we're just going to take them out of the flour and don't have another bowl that has no flowering next step we take our 1 cup of milk we take our cockadoodledoo and we normally would throw the eggshell at Steve but we'll put it you mean compost comedy death with a man yeah egg beater if you don't have one of these buy one there a dollar or use a fork or use a fork we're actually going to pour it into the bowl with our flour mixture move hell yeah I like sound effects and we're going to take our egg beater that we used and we're going to just dip it up so it's kind of like pancake batter yes it is your honor next up now we're going to pour this batter and we hung this bowl full of onions yep all right so you've got your onions in your batter in the bowl now you've got to mix them up and coat all the onions which is this is so fun all right now you got your onions coated in this batter and it's ready to go into the breadcrumbs Chuck a man's read them up so I can hear it right now it wants some onion rings in there a little bit anyway you can gauge by your deep fryer or boiling pot of oil as your financial circumstances may allow but we can throw in our onion segments into the deep fryer we're going to drop them right so don't forget when you're cooking your onion rings in your deep fryer pot full of oil whatever you gotta flip these bad boys because they'll only cook on one side why is that because they float Steve so this is what your end product is going to look like nice crispy Goldie brown onion room onion ring that's right yeah making onion rings beers well that sounds crunchy they all sound so crunchy very crunchy right on and you can season these bad boys up if you want with the lowest for most form of seasoned salt it doesn't even have a company it's just seasoning salt which is already the lowest form of seasoning but you end up with these drive-in fast food restaurant style crispy onion rings and these have been out of the deep fryer for a bit but watch this see see how catching crunch yes I want this in now nice 10 minutes after being deep-fried those things crunch
