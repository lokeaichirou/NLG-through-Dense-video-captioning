 welcome to how to cook great food calm we'll be making a lamb curry today I'll run through some ingredients with you now as you can see I've got I've got about half a kg 500 grams of lamb there on the bone nice little bit of fat on it steel I've got some chopped tomatoes there as bachelor 3 medium size tomatoes about 4 medium size thinly sliced onions do a bit of red food color here I've got my whole purpose of spices garam masala which I'll run through with you at the cooker but some fresh chopped green chilli I've got some ginger and garlic paste and here I've got my powders about a teaspoon of each I've got chili powder cumin powder coriander powder turmeric white howdy salt and pepper I'm going to do this in a pressure cooker just because if it gets that meat really nice and tender you can do it without a pressure cooker but it will take a long time so if you've got one of those it is really going to speed this process up let's go over to the cooker we're going to start off with a little touch of mustard oil and of course touch of water okay so it's got pressure cooker here with a little touch of mustard oil in there you can use a different oil if you want but that will give it a nice taste in goes all of my whole garam masala I've got their baby lips mustard seeds if you coriander seeds dry chili cinnamon stick we're just going to cook those until they pop a little bit which should just be 30 seconds 40 seconds really there you go that releases all those beautiful flavors and infuses that oil okay why that's happening let's get out our doing salt pepper cumin coriander and turmeric or halibut smells amazing already let's go going down fresh chilies and then garlic dip your face Wow now I'm going to go to the onions thinly sliced we just want to put these two a couple of minutes and let me back so there you go just a couple of minutes they've shot them down the little little and the Oromo is incredible let's drop our meat in there nice a little bit of that color in there that red color in just like the teaspoon of that as its color it will add no flavor at all to sir visual effect really okay so what I'm going to do is I want to get all this meat cooked a little bit still nicely get some of those flavors in there I'm going to keep stirring this and I'll be back in about four or five minutes do then okay just come over really nicely and let some water was that two cups of water they're enough to just cover it over and like I say I'm going to use a pressure cooker here if you haven't got a pressure cooker you can of course still make this I'm going to bring this to the boil and a pressure cook it for about six minutes if you're doing this in the conventional non pressure pot then you're going to need to cook this lamb for about 40 minutes I'm afraid so and maybe invest in a pressure cooker I'll be back when it's done so that's been on for about seven minutes let's take a look now don't forget that I'm all pressure cookers are different so what we're trying to aim for you is getting this meat nice and tender you just give it a prod with your spoon it's pretty good so the completely as expected fantastic red color now we're going to do is get out tomatoes in some sliced tomatoes I'm going to relight the heat get there the step and I'm going to cook this with the lid off now because I want to reduce that down it's a little bit too wet too much water in there so I'll cut this leave the lid off for about four to five minutes let's just reduce that down slightly I'll see you then there we go let's reduce down nicely those tomatoes have completely disappeared and cooked into a lovely lovely sauce there I've tasted it for a little bit more seasoning it was fine for me obviously you're just how you want you could at the end here I don't know a bit of yogurt I'm not going to or you could even add some fresh coriander again I'm not going for that this for me is perfect we'll see you next time take care
