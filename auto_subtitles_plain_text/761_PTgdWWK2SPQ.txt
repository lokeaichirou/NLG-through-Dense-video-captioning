 it's cooking with Cuisinart great recipes from master chefs now one of the Marika's greatest chefs Hubert Keller from fleur de lis in San Francisco and Las Vegas the burger bar in Las Vegas and st. Louis and sleek Steakhouse in st. Louis and now today's recipe pasta fagioli it's a great hearty soup in Italy and what it means fat usually are those little white beans right over here or the cannelloni beans it's a great soup the problem with it it takes about two to two and half hours to cook the slow white beans until they're really tender and what I'm using today is a great pressure cooker over here and what that pressure cooker does it cooks the beans in about 35 minutes let me show you how to do it so first I have some celery right over here and I will slice that celery so just like that okay once I have the celery going I will remove now the celery from the working Bowl okay let me transfer that right in here okay once I have that so now the next ingredients are we putting the blade into the bowl and we'll transfer three garlic cloves in there and we'll chop em until really fine perfect so once I have that so now the next step I'm adding some onions to it so that's about two medium onions or one and a half larger ones that I've coated up already and the other element is a carrot so I'm just going to cut the carrot kind of coarsely before adding it to the food processor and I have that let me put that in and just couple on and offs I'm chopping now the onions and the carrots and I will transfer all those vegetables in the pressure cooker so I'm taking the lid off and the pressure cooker actually also works like a saute pan or like a brazier I turned out the heat and what I will do now I will sear up the vegetables in a pressure cooker just by adding a little bit of olive oil and I will transfer now all the vegetables that onions garlic and the carrots into the oil so now I'm also adding the sliced celery into my vegetable mix and some Italian spice mix and now I'm just gonna keep on steering that very gently until my onions become really nice and translucent and it's amazing just by adding actually that the Italian spice mix just to the heat I can really smell it right there already so it's quite amazing we have not even started cooking and it smells already wonderful okay my vegetables are really nice and ready and steaming so the next step now I'm having my cannelloni beans I'm adding one pound of beans right over it and I have 6 cups of water right over okay so once I have that one more item they leave right into it so now let me close it and let me set the high pressure I just set the pressure cooker on 35 minutes on high pressure and believe it or not just 35 minutes and those beans gonna be butter tender all right and now you see the steam actually building up that means the pressure keeps on building up inside and as soon as steam stops the countdown starts 35 minutes and we are ready with some great beans so I cook the beans for 35 minutes and a naturally released the pressure from it for about 20 minutes I'm ready now to open up the lid okay and you see how it is and you can see how my carrots and my beans are already nice and tender right there and I was basically achieved just in 35 minutes so now the next step I'm adding some more chicken stock to it okay and I have some diced tomatoes I'm adding to it okay so now we have that and let me set it up to browning so what I'm trying to achieve now here is actually bringing everything to a boil and at the last moment I'm adding the pasta so just gonna drizzle the pasta nicely into it and I gotta bring it back to a simmer and we'll cook the pasta for about ten to twelve minutes and the soup is absolutely ready I guess the soup is ready as you can see on easy words to cook those beans so now come time for plating okay so you can see how nice and you can even see it how tender those beans are and how easy it was to cook them just for about 35 minutes of course I want to get some of that broth and by the beans cooking that way it really thickens up the broth of you see you can see so that and now the way I really like to serve it is with some Parmesan cheese that I'm sprinkling just over and that can be pretty generous with the Parmesan cheese you can even serve a little bit of the cheese on the side and of course sprinkle a little bit of parsley over it here goes the pasta e fagioli the great great soup and it's very simple to do but also remember by using the pressure cooker you can even use it on a party and serving the pot just like that keep it the set on simmer and during the whole party the your friends on everyone can just help themselves nailing up the soup a great way without a pressure cooker you will never be able to cook the beans in 35 minutes
