 aloha and welcome to Katie a kitchens I'm chef Michi and today I'm going to show you how to make Vietnamese style pork patty pita sandwiches let's start with the ingredients for our ingredients today the pork patties we're going to use ground pork some ginger garlic sweet chili sauce minced water chestnuts some sliced green onion and cilantro or Chinese parsley and then we're going to make a really nice sauce with fat-free Greek yogurt some low-fat mayonnaise she racha sweet chili sauce and again green onions then when we make our pita sandwiches we're going to use some Japanese cucumber shallots shredded cabbage and fresh mint leaves and these are all going to go in our whole wheat pita pockets so let's get started we're going to start off by making the pork patties we're just going to combine all these ingredients together you've got the pork this fresh ginger and the garlic just adds such a nice flavor in there sweet chili sauce it all just goes together and we're going to blend it and then we're going to make the patties the water chestnuts add a nice little crunch in there the green onions and the cilantro they add green as well as some flavor so all we do now actually is just you want to kind of mix it around you can you can mix it for a bit with your spoon but to be honest you really do need to get in there and because it's raw pork I am going to put some gloves on that'll just give me a good chance to blend all of that together if you don't have gloves again you can use your bare hands just make sure after to wash your hands very thoroughly with warm water and soap so you don't want to over over mix this just kind of lightly mix everything together there and we're going to make little patties you want to grab about size of a walnut and roll it into a ball I've already pre sprayed this pan right here with some cooking spray and that'll allow the patties to not stick also helps them to brown a little bit so we're going to create a lot of these little patties and then we're going to put them into a 350 degree oven will be baking them for 15 minutes on one side then we're going to just flip them over for another 10 minutes so both sides will get nice and brown so now that the patties are all portioned out I'm going to put them in the oven now while the pork patties are cooking we're going to make our sauce for our pita sandwiches I like to use the fat-free Greek yogurt this is a really nice way to make a beautiful sauce it doesn't have all the calories of mayonnaise I mix the yogurt with the mayonnaise and all that flavor just permeates into the yogurt and you've got a lighter sauce it's just a little trick that I like to use I'm going to add some si si racha I do like that spicy goodness some sweet chili and green onions this adds color flavor just mix this sauce together these are going to go into the peat as it gives it a little moisture and a lot of flavor it's going to go perfect with those vietnamese pork patties so we've just taken the vietnamese pork patties out of the oven they're beautifully browned on both sides because we did flip them part way through that just helps both sides to get nicely browned so for the Assembly of these pita sandwiches you just take a pita and I like to layer it so that it's easy to eat and all the flavors are going to kind of meld together you want to start off with a little cabbage that's kind of the bed it's going to hold that pork patty in there you want to put about 2 / poor pita to open this up a little more then you're going to put some sauce right onto that patty these are fairly quick to make so it's a quick meal super crunchy and healthy some cucumber the fresh mint is just beautiful and a little bit of shallots and then we're going to keep assembling all these sandwiches and I can't wait to try one now is my favorite part i'm just going to take a little taste mmm that is delicious the pork patty with the sauce the crunchy cucumber and the mint all goes so well together this would pair really great with a sparkling rose a for this recipe and more please visit katie a super stores com / recipes thank you for joining me at kta kitchens I'm chef Michi Aloha you
