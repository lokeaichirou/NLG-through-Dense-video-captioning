 this dish is one of my family's all-time favorite meals for the summer it's a beautiful chicken Caesar salad it's quite easy to make especially if you use a store-bought dressing but I really love a homemade dressing so I'm going to show you how to do that you can make the homemade dressing with electric hand beaters but I'm going to do it very simply in a food processor so that's all blitz together it's become this beautiful creamy emulsion and I'm just gonna taste it to see if it needs any more soul burp it but more more lemon juice the next thing I need to do is just to slice up some ugly chicken breasts and I'm going to lightly pan fry that being very careful not to drive out then I need to cook some bacon some croutons and poach a few weeks I've got two cutting boards out here one I'm going to use for the chicken and the bacon and the other one I'll use for the salad vegetables and also for the bread because you can't cross contaminate your meat with your vegetables it's very important finish the croutons and now I'm going to poach some eggs I can do it all in the same pan I'll just wipe it out to make sure there's no breadcrumbs in there pour in some boiling water and I need to bring it to quite a gentle simmer to poach the eggs it's really important for poached eggs that the waters on a really gentle simmer if it's boiling too rapidly they'll just break up and fly apart and the other really important thing is that the eggs are as fresh as you can possibly get so I've torn up a cause lettuce and I've tossed that through with half a red onion and a really generous amount of that dressing and all that's left to do is assemble it by putting the other ingredients on top so there you have it it's my warm chicken Caesar salad and let me tell you that plate of food will make my family very happy
