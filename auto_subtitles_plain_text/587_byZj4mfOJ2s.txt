 hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make delicious and moist turkey meatloaf now if you guys have had turkey meatloaf before you might have found that it's kind of dry and bland not very appetizing at all this meatloaf here is absolutely fantastic its moist its juicy it doesn't have the greasy in heavy dense feeling that a traditional beef meatloaf has if you've never tried this with turkey before definitely give this a try and it's super easy to make up so let's get started I'm going to start off using 1 pound of ground turkey here now you can do this recipe with beef as well that's perfectly fine I'm just showing you how to do a turkey meatloaf here I'm going to add in 2/3 of a cup of breadcrumbs as well as 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion flakes you could use chopped real lemons if you want to I'm just doing this quick and easy so I'm using the mince stuff then I'm going to add in 3/4 of a cup of whole milk and also use 2% or 1% that's fine this is what's going to keep our meatloaf nice and moist next I'm going to take one egg and beat that up the reason I pretty beat this is because when we go to mix this together you want to be careful with the meat you don't want to over mix it because that's going to give you a really dense meatloaf so I'm just going to add that into my mix into my bowl I'm also going to add in one teaspoon of soy sauce that's completely optional it does make a difference however I'm going to use some seasoned pepper here and season this up maybe half a teaspoon or so and I'm also going to use some fresh cracked black pepper now using my hands I'm just going to gently start folding these ingredients together now you don't want to go crazy with a spoon or get out an electric mixer don't do me that stuff that's going to make your meatloaf dense and it's going to make it kind of pasty you want to keep your ground turkey as whole as possible and turkey as its naturally is is really kind of a soft knee and you don't want to break up that grind so be careful and gentle with this mixture just fold it over on itself and press it down don't mix this any more than you have to this is also why I pre beat the egg so that way we don't have to mix it in there and you know mix this mixture to death you just want to mix this until everything is incorporated now I've just got a standard cookie sheet here and I'm going to go ahead and line it with a piece of foil the reason I use the foil on there is for a easy cleanup I'll have to do is take the meat loaf off of it or the foil away the cookie sheet is you know nice and clean doesn't need to be washed so I'm just going to take my meat mixture and put that out onto the foil and now I'm going to start shaping this into a loaf if you will air quotes there I don't use a loaf pan for my meat loaf it I find it takes really long time to cook meat loaf that way and I don't want this in the oven for a long time so I'm going to Pat this out until it is about maybe an inch and a half thick or so and I'm going to try and get this into a rectangular shape and then I'm going to slightly press down a little divot in the center don't go overboard with this just you want to make a very shallow little ditch in the center and that's where our sauce is going to go now for the sauce on top I just like a ketchup based sauce I've got 1/3 of a cup of ketchup in here I'm going to add in two tablespoons of brown sugar and I'm going to guesstimate about a tablespoon or so of prepared yellow mustard using a spoon I'm just going to mix this mixture up now if you like a brown gravy brown sauce on yours you know go ahead and make your favorite sauce on top this is what my favorite is so yeah this is what I'm going to use but once I get that mixed together I'm going to go ahead and put that on top of my meatloaf I'm just gonna place it right in the ditch be sure to get all that sauce deliciousness out with the bulb and then using a spoon I'm just going to coat the entire top of my meatloaf here now the other nice thing about cooking in meatloaf like this as opposed to in a loaf pan is that each piece every bite that you get of meatloaf will have a little bit of your sauce on it I find when you make meatloaf in a loaf pan it's just it's short on sauce and I like sauce on my meatloaf so but once you get that on there then you want to go ahead and put this into a preheated 350 degree oven and you want to bake this for between 40 and 45 minutes or so it is best to use a thermometer if you have one you want to cook it to an internal temperature of 160 degrees if you don't have a thermometer go ahead and cut into it make sure that it is no longer pink inside the juices are running clear then you want to let your meatloaf rest for about ten minutes before you cut into it that again will keep your meatloaf nice and juicy and then when you are ready to serve it go ahead and slice it into slices and then you can go ahead and serve this up and you can see how nice and juicy this month meatloaf is it is not dry by any means that milk in there really helps to keep it moist it's an all-around basic and versatile recipe from here you can add whatever ingredients that you like if you want to add peppers to this and carrots and all that other jazz vegetables to your meatloaf I know some people like that do that with your own meatloaf but this is just how I like mine so there you go that's how you make turkey meatloaf I hope you guys enjoy if you did be sure to give this video a thumbs up I would greatly
