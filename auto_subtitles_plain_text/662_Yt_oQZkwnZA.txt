 hey guys and welcome to my eat clean series with Scott today I'm going to be making a very delicious shepherd's pie with celeriac mash so this Shepard supplier has a slight twist seeing as we're using slurry act as the mash instead of potato but the base is quite similar so we're going to start off we're going to fry off some onions so just put in some coconut oil and we'll melt that down so we'll fry these off to 5 minutes until they've got a nice little bronze color and okay next we're going to add in our garlic is that a good stir and in goes the grated carrot and then we're just going to move this to the side we're just going to bronze the meat got some beautiful organic lambs going in so you just want to bronze up keep stirring it around so this is such a beautiful family dish I feel like it's something you just want to enjoy sort of cozy at home with the whole family and we'll put all the details in the full description on the website so you can see that we've pretty much bronze to me and all the pinky bits are going so we can just stir that all together now I've got some dried rosemary and thyme so put those in there smelling gorgeous and I'm going to add in some fresh chicken stock and always go for fresh give that a nice stir in goes in tomato puree and a nice pinch of good quality salt just stir that all together and this is pretty much our base done so we're just going to leave this to simmer and cook through for 15 minutes while we make the celeriac mash so I've just chopped it up into sort of little inch cubes roughly and got some boiling water in here and we're just going to boil it up until it's cooked through so I'm using celeriac instead of potato because it's the last starch here and also it's getting a bit more load to goodness into you but you could use also cauliflower works really well thanks Larry it's a really good root veg it's still got that sort of thick taste and no one's going to tell the difference so you don't have to tell anyone that it's lower yet so we're going to cook this through add the rest of the ingredients and then chuck it in the food processor and blend it until it's smooth the celerio acts nice and cooked through so you just want to feel like your fork can smoothly go through I've drained off all the liquid and we're pouring this into the food processor if you don't have a food processor you could also use a hand blender in goes one egg yolk teaspoon of mustard and coconut oil and a nice pinch of salt as well and then we'll blend this till smooth perfect look at that who would know that they're celeriac in there it smells delicious first of all we're going to ladle in our beautiful mint just been cooking away and all those flavors are really coming together now and then we'll put the mash on top and I really do love seeing a recreation and a big shout out to Paul lush seven I hope I'm saying your name right for sending in your awesome recreation of my fish pie I hope you enjoyed it and I'm sure you're going to like this one too okay so the mash is on and then we're just going to do a little crisscross those on top which will give a nice crispy mash when it goes in so we've got the oven preheated to 200 and we're just going to whack within you so here is my nicely cooked celeriac shepherd's pie I hope you enjoyed this video and make sure you subscribe to Scot food and also to my youtube channel and I'll see you next time you
