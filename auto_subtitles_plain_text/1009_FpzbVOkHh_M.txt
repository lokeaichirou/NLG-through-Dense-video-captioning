 so come to Telos kitchen today I'm going to make a very authentic a speciality dish of for my sir it's called chana masala chole masala you can savor chick pea masala it's not a rocket science very easy to make and really we pinch our peace love turnover server know and really impress are you people they won't want to have like chana masala every mortar into place I have got from Amritsar but I am area of this align oh how it is so let me introduce you guys want ingredients I need for this recipe because we will be making it as a restaurant style and wrestling style so I want to tell you all the ingredients we need for this because we don't want to compromise on the ingredients or we don't want to compromise on your taste so if you want Punjabi taste so let's see what actually we need here is the chickpea I have a chickpea you can say chole which I soaked overnight and just give one whistle in the pressure cooker and it's done so if you will take in your fingers mash it it's it's getting mashed so this is what we need in actually what people do is some people put in a pressure cooker they put some two three teabags in that along with that they'll focus kadai masala that is barely some cloths and some black cardamom in it I don't do that because I like to add garam masala in my circa in my tampering and for the teabags I'm not I have not used tea bags in this what I will do is I will microwave with some water in it this is like to take teaspoon of our tea or black tea I'm using alpaca with this one minute and then I will show you how at what time we will be putting it this it will become really black so the secret of this recipe I would say blackness comes from this D flat E and Kasturi Metis this is really in super in median for this recipe and for our tempering you'll be using bay leaves drops around 10 to 12 loss and around 3 to 4 black cardamoms so you can break black cardamom this way I have already picked broker it it's very hard so and we need around 1/2 medium size finely chopped onions see it's really finely chopped you if you don't want to chop it just puree it and puree it the way I have pure at this tomatoes so I have around 4 tomatoes because the again secret in this recipe is to Madame's more Tomatoes you will use more you will get the timeliness flavor so form the 4 medium size tomatoes fresh reputed some sort to your taste the some red chili powder some sugar then chana masala powder this is a real secret so 4 of 2 tbsp of chana masala I'm using a net some chemical base and some come to order that is try mango powder and on our Donna where's Foreman grape seeds and for garnishing we need the champions that is lucha onion cut in this way it is this will use for garnishing with the lengthwise sliced ginger in it so let's start the process once your janay our boy it doesn't take much time to get this dish done so my oil is already heated up here I have used around 2 tbsp of oil here goes my Dave leaves some people really don't like it but I like to use if it's party special of or if it's not participation then also I like to use this Kedah masalas and here goes black cardamom I am using around 3 black cardamom Turner just give it a stir and feel like stir this for 1 minute then when your cloths get popped up it means it's done here it goes the onions no ginger no garlic in this recipe but ginger yah he will be using at the end just for garnishing no human seeds nothing in this I use onion it share this until it's like golden brown then we'll be putting our fury it will take like 2 to 3 my onions are done here goes fury it does mix it we have to cook intelligently use the oil from the sides I'll be putting some salt and one dimension right right now some salt according to your taste so I'm using I would say for one cup of chickpeas because I am using around one cup of chickpea I'm using around 1 TSP of salt some red chilli powder yeah if you guys like green chilli you can add accordingly I don't add so I just cover this for 5 minutes and we'll check back after 5 minutes in the meanwhile I have already put 5 t over here if you have tea bags I don't use tea bags that's reason I'm going this way just microwave this for one minute and then it's like 5 minutes I would say and it's going to take more 5-10 minutes I would say so we want really our tomatoes to get cooked well so that's reason it's going to take time because the recipe secret again is tomatoes should not be undercooked it should we all cope well say so look at the masala instead of looking like a it has started leaving oil so that means it's done at this point of time we have more important Archana we don't want to you know put more water in this because this is never watery just such enormous Allah is like it's like a semi gravy so we don't want a much gravy so I'll be just putting this by hands because I don't want to put water along with we will put water slowly in it so once you put all the channel net at this point of time I like to use my tea black tea so just train it in a strainer so it will take a time to like get a color in it so at this time I'm going to put all the masalas here goes my chana masala here goes my amateur border and an our Donna from great seeds there goes some sugar around 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here goes some tamarind paste I am using this adds a flavor some tankyness and sugar add some no sweetness to this dish if you feel it's not very black you can you know just put some more tea just boil it in a microwave for around one and a half minute and put it the way you want so I'll just check back because it takes some time to get the color so I'll check that I'll just cover this with a lid for around 5-10 minutes and check will check back and so on medium heat gets around I would say 10 minutes it's cooking and the only thing it's look at the color isn't it looking Amla sorry chole so I'll give like 5 more minutes and at this time you can check any salt or anything you wanted to add on so just you know stick to the ingredients I have told you if you don't have chana masala you can add on now more onto water that is trying on the water and more of fact if you have ginger Corder in your house use that it will add flavor to it if you have German masala nothing is you know nothing is special you want in that so just I will cover it with a lid again and check back after 5 minutes so it it's ready it took me like 20 minutes to get really root and get the color in the texture because when we put a black tea in the way I have told you it needs some time to cook in it so at this point of time I am just learning with the heat eutychus to Lima Thea nerd and here goes on the chart gasps the crunchiness of the slit repairs it's really amazing and some ginger I have put some over here because I want some to be good to get my chole here goes a ginger some slices lengthwise sliced cut ginger and it's done just for some cilantro and ready to serve here goes my chole masala essentially you can say chana masala this is what color we eat over there it's never red you know all different color so yes you definitely have to put tea bags in it tea plant in Asheville that try out the way I have told you is not so difficult very easy to make and a real good party dish and leave me comments if you have any TV citations don't forget to subscribe on my
