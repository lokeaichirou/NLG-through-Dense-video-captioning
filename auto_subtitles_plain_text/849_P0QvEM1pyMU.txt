 hi I'm chef Keith snow welcome to my kitchen I want to show you how you can make your own grilled chicken Caesar salad very easy the first step is to add our chicken grilling I'm gonna get our grill nice and hot here and in this bowl is one chicken breast first thing I'm gonna do is take the juice of 1/2 of lemon and you obviously could let this marinate a little bit but you don't really need to a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil some black pepper quite a bit of black pepper and then some kosher salt we take our tongs and just make sure that this chicken breast gets seasoned and sort of marinate it all the way around and the reason you wouldn't want to let this sit is that's lemon juice it'll start to cook the chicken so our grill is nice and hot we'll take this chicken breast and get it right on and now this I'll let cook and then we'll pay attention to the rest of our salad so here is our lettuce and this is organic romaine lettuce and romaine is definitely the kind you want to use for Caesar because it has good crispness so what we'll do here is we'll take our bowl and usually this is just torn you don't really need to use a knife to cut it up just tear it up with your hands [Music] the other thing I would say is when you're making a Caesar salad you surely want your serving plate to be very cold because there's nothing worse than warm Caesar salad the biggest reason I don't order it in most restaurants because I've had it come out to me warm too many times and I'm just picky about cold salad and also you want to make sure your greens are chilled as well we're gonna take our Caesar salad dressing pour the whole thing right over the top that's about a quarter cup we're gonna take a little bit of our Parmesan cheese not the whole thing and get that in there and then I'm gonna reach right here and take two spoons and start tossing this trying to get all of the greens coded in the Caesar mix okay our chicken is done so we are going to take it off you see I developed some nice carmelization on the chicken give it beautiful flavor so from this point I'm going to grab quick fork and you want to slice this into strips [Music] so let me grab my tossed salad and I'll put a nice big pile in the center of our plate just like that and then we're going to take our chicken which is pretty hot put that right over the top we don't need all that and then I garnish with the remaining Parmesan cheese and of course our crunchy garlic croutons and there is a chicken Caesar salad that you can be proud of make that one today harvest eating calm the only social network website on the Internet dedicated to seasonal local and organic foods view hundreds of recipe instruction videos hosted by chef Keith snow a nationally recognized expert in seasonal cooking all it takes is an email address to join now for free we welcome you into the harvest eating community start living healthier today you
