 today I'm going to make for you a really delicious chinese-american classic dish General Tso's chicken and to make it even better it's going to be lighter than the original so you have to feel zero guilt when you're eating it slice four cloves of garlic then you're going to make your sauce I have in this bowl 1/2 a cup of water and to that add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch the cornstarch adds thickness to your sauce so whisk that in then add one pound of snow peas and add your garlic then 2 teaspoons of peeled and grated or minced ginger 3 tablespoons of light brown sugar General Tso's chicken does have a tendency to be quite sweet it's not even an authentic Chinese recipe I don't know if you guys know this but it was invented in the United States for the American consumer in the 1970s add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce mmm to measure carefully and a half a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes you can also use fresh chilies in this recipe if you want to okay that's the veg portion now for the chicken portion this is 2 egg whites I just like to whisk them to break them up a little bit - they're not all clumped together and then add 3 tablespoons of corn starch this corn starts just going to coat your chicken and make it golden brown as I'm whisking this together I'm reminded of this dish that I used to make when I first moved to New York my brother taught me this dish this is a pound of chicken he taught me this dish I loved it so much I probably ate it like three times a week coat you're 1 pound of skinless boneless chicken breast in your cornstarch mixture season it was half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper make sure that your chicken is nicely coated in your egg mixture then heat your pan over medium-high heat and then add a tablespoon of vegetable oil once the pan is hot enough you can add your chicken don't crowd your pan because otherwise it won't get golden brown so if you need to do it in three batches do it in three batches you to cook these until the chicken is cooked through and they're nice and golden-brown that should take five six to eight minutes the cornstarch and egg white coating is giving it a nice crispness without a lot of fat it's kind of amazing actually you can do this with other cuts of meat too if you wanted to you want to make sure that your chicken is nice and firm when you touch it and that it's completely opaque throughout I use the ultra specific technique of touching it with my hand see if it's firm I highly recommend that as they're done you can set them aside on a plate and now you can add your snow pea mixture the liquid might splatter with the fat in the pan so step back cook your snow peas until they're bright green and the sauce thickens a little bit cover it up just for a couple minutes till they get nice and bright green I'm getting excited are you getting excited gonna be delish I like to uncover them stir them around a little bit as they're cooking because the pan is pretty full right you don't want them to cook unevenly they'll take about three to five minutes depending on how crisp you want them how soft you want them that looks pretty good to me I'm going to add the chicken back in with any juices that have accumulated on the plate toss it around this is just to heat it through coat the chicken with any sauce that's in the pan if you're a real sauce person and you want tons of sauce to like drizzle into your rice you could double the soft ingredients the water cornstarch soy sauce all of that and that's it really fast I mean I'm not gonna say that it's totally authentic but you know what the dish isn't totally authentic to begin with so who cares it's totally authentically delicious lots of vegetables crispy chicken sweet and spicy sauce serve it with some brown rice and enjoy it's lighter General Tso's chicken at you hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this
