 hi i'm jim winner from the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University and today we're going to talk about a one-pot minestrone soup which is about a 20-minute soup it's high in protein it's a little bit lower in fat a little bit lower in sodium and it's a great soup takes about 20 minutes is about 6 ingredients and the beauty of this is it really only takes one pot to make this entire batch of soup what we're gonna do is we're gonna add some low sodium low fat chicken broth to the pan like this we've got about a quart in here and the thing that you really want to look at is when you're looking at the nutrient information or the back of the container this has about 420 milligrams of sodium so if we were to get the regular chicken broth it would have 840 milligrams of sodium per portion the average amount of sodium the standard today is 2,000 milligrams per day so if you eat one cup of soup you're really about there halfway there already so that's one of the reasons that we went with the low sodium and fat free broth we're gonna let this cook and actually bring this to a real quick boil now while we're waiting for that to boil we're gonna talk about some of the meat that we're putting in here we're using chicken tenderloin which is a little more expensive but the great thing about chicken tenderloin is a cooks very quickly it's very low fat and when you add it to your soup it adds some flavor to your broth as well the other ingredients that we have that make it simple we've got a mixed frozen vegetable which is which has green beans some corn and some carrot or carrots in here we have a whole wheat pasta that we're add to that we've got some fresh spinach that we're gonna finish this off with and we have Parmesan Reggiano cheese and the Parmesan Reggiano cheese somewhat compensates for the salt that you'll put in the soup and then we're gonna season it with black pepper real simple to make now we've got the the broth has already moved and you can tell by the the way the broth is starting to stir around a little bit that it is moving so when it had our chicken tenderloins to the broth and what we're going to do is let these cool and you're gonna let these cook till they're no longer pink in the center for about five or six minutes we're gonna put these in here and let them go so we've got the chicken tenderloins that are already cooking in the broth they took about four or five minutes and the thing that's great about using these because there's no bones in here very little connective tissue they cook very very quickly what we're gonna do is we're going to take the chicken tenderloins out of the broth tomorrow we're taking these out and we're gonna let them cool then we're gonna chop them we're gonna put them right back into the soup while these are sitting here kollene we're gonna add the whole-wheat pasta in this case reason penne pasta which really works well it's a whole grain pasta and this holds up well in the soup and actually is about the same size of the chicken meat which is really what you want you wouldn't want to use a larger size pasta or a smaller size pasta you want the food in the soup or any dish you make to look assistant in size so we're gonna have the pasta stir that around a bit we're gonna add our veggies we're gonna let these cook for about 12 minutes and the pan is still very very hot because we had boiled the chicken breast in here or the chicken tenderloins now we're gonna let this cook for about 12 minutes and we'll chop the chicken tenderloins we're gonna add that back to the soup and we're almost done so we're gonna go ahead and chop up the chicken tenderloins and again these are cooked completely and if you look how easy these chopped and how great they're going to taste in this soup it's gonna be delicious so what we'll do with these chicken tenders is while everything else is cooking we're gonna add these back into the soup not only they're gonna add some flavor they're gonna add some depth to the soup as well and again you want to handle these when you're able to handle them you don't want to handle them when they're super super hot or you're gonna end up burning yourself but you really don't want to do take our chicken I'm gonna add this to our soup and you can tell already the soup looks great because it's got a lot of color it's got a lot of texture to it you've got the pasta noodles in here you've got the the frozen vegetables and then you have the chicken in here so there's a lot of things going for this soup that makes it really really good plus it's low-sodium the soup has been cooking for about eight minutes right now and the noodle the reason today is a whole wheat noodle this is about ready to go the noodles themselves are about al dente which means firm to the bite so we're gonna go ahead you see the soup it's getting to a good boil we're to go ahead and add our fresh spinach you can use frozen spinach in this recipe as well but I prefer to use fresh spinach actually this spinach here when you see when we add this to soup that's gonna end up in to next to nothing because spinach really contracts when it cooks we're gonna go ahead and add this to the soup and if you like spinach you can always add more to it so you can see this soup looks great lots of color in the soup which is really what you want with your food because we tend to eat with our eyes and if you see the colors that we have here the Greens the yellows the oranges it's just beautiful looking soup and again it takes very very little time to prepare this product today so right now the spinach is actually ready to go we're going to turn off the flame take a little bit of black pepper and I'm going to season this with black pepper okay the soup is ready to go okay we're gonna go ahead we've got this nice looking soup dish here I'm gonna go ahead and add this to the bowl okay here's roughly about 18 ounces of soup lots of color we're gonna have some Parmesan Reggiano Reggiano cheese to this as well and we've got a really good-looking soup you
