 hi I'm Tonya welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to show you how to prepare pumpkin Peter we would call them Piero is Daniel and I thought right now Thanksgiving it will be nice to make a Polish bureau with a little bit of Thanksgiving twist and the taste is a little bit different so now everyone will like it but if you do like pumpkin or pumpkin spice you're going to love them I'm guessing all right so let's have a look at the ingredients then you will know what you need in case you decide to give it a try my own yarn I'm going to chop it very finely and make sure it's really funny because you do not want to feel the onion in your pure ghee oh and then the next step is to come and caramelize the onions Wanda frying pan and added some vegetable oil warmed it up and I heat it up actually and now i'm adding my onions and i'm going to be cooking them for around 45 minutes on the menu Pete mixing from time to time they need to get glossy and soft here we go and then into my ear into my ear mixing bowl I'm adding the pumpkin beer and and my ricotta cheese the pumpkin spice I'm adding a whole peaceful better if you don't like it that much just up half of the teaspoon is going to be perfectly okay okay I'm checking for seasoning adding my onions and then I'm going to add some salt and pepper and now time to mix it some more check for seasoning again everything needs a little bit more of soul and then I'm hiding my bread crumbs okay after that is the final mix have everything while I cooperated and then we have it ready so we can put it aside I'm going to cover it with the ceramic wrap and right now it's nice to prepare the dough I am transferring my flour into my food processor I'm going to add a teaspoon of salt and then in that mark there you see i boiled water it's not hot anymore but it's still very warm I'm going to pulse it a little bit just to mix the salt and flour together and then it's time to start adding slowly the water and now we're watching what happens with our flour and went slowly adding the water because the moment the flower starts forming a dough with the water that you can see a ball going around in your food processor that means it's enough I added here around the three quarter of a cup but every time flower is different so it can vary kindy one captain can be more than a cap and then when this is done you want to go for another minute or so and then the dough is ready now in the large part and putting water adding 1 teaspoon of salt and drinking it boil while we work on our Bureau okay when you work a few more time you unique your your dough you will see that it's very elastic and it stops being sticky very quickly now if it is a little bit sticky just add a little bit more flour to your cell surface as you can see we rolling and flipping rolling and flipping now we want to roll it to really thin layer i would say 120 millimeters it also depends on what you like because I noticed my mom is my liking them very thing my grandma was making them a little bit thicker I like them somehow in the middle now on the plate I'm putting some flour because I'm going to be putting ready Rocky before they go to ball and I don't want them to stick to my play and then with the glass I'm going to be cutting out circles okay here we go that's done now I'm bringing my stuffing uncovering good and now all those leftovers which am picking up right now I'm going to form a ball out of them and put them in a ziploc bag so they don't dry out so I can roll them again and have similar agadir okay and right now very important part when you pick up the the dough you want to flip it as you so I flipped it because the part which was sticking to the table it's going to be much easier to stick to each other to close the perigean not open them so they don't open in the water and now we want to press it on the edges and another important tip for this is don't put too much stuffing because if the staffing goes on the edge of the of the pierogi again they will not close or they will open while boiling sometimes if they would try to match my mom says she's keeping a little shot glass of warm water and she's picking her finger to make the edge clean and wet so they they stick better but I didn't have that problem and now here there is my husband and he bought me this little machine for making paragen he's showing me how to use it it's actually cute oh we put the dough inside then we would he's putting it out quarter of a tablespoon there in that machine when I'm doing it with my hands I was putting the line around half a tablespoon which is not much for for AP rocky but this stuffing it's pretty soft and that's why when I'm making a meat per oggi or ruski the one with cheese and potatoes which the recipes are coming very soon so stay tuned I'm putting around the table spoon of a of stuffing okay here we go he does it again hello very nice they look more professional with the little machine okay and then when my parakeet are ready and putting them into the boiling water I put the heat to a little bit lower just so they don't bubble too much and then very gently steer them with the wooden spoon I don't want them to stick to the bottom okay then we have a nonstick spray on the play and we waiting for all the bureau key to flow up to the surface and when this happens and keeping it for another minute boiling and then fishing them out here we go okay and now time to spray them on the top again with nonstick spray you can do it like this or my mom is just using a brush in the oil okay we serve them just from the water with sour cream or you can fry them if you would like to I hope you enjoyed this recipe and let me know what you think and I will see you next time happy thanksgiving bye
