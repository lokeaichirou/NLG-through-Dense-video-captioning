 welcome back to my show desi aroma and this is a continues from my those are videos so the bathroom which I showed you all in my last video and if you haven't seen it you can go back and see how the batter is done this is how the batter looks and it's also mented and ready to go now I told you that this batter needs some salt before you make the doses but I'm not going to take salt and mix it in the whole batter because that's ruins your goggle so what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove some of the batter in this smaller container I have and I'll just use exactly what I need for my for my dosas so I'm separating some batter in here and then I'm going to add just enough salt in there what I need so in this you know about this much salt is okay and then I'm going to just mix this batter up and that is ready for my doses so let's go ahead and make some dosas now I have my frypan and buy yourself a nonstick it definitely helps I've got that on medium-high for about a minute and all minute two minutes what I'm going to do is I want to make sure that the temperature is exactly right so what are you doing is sprinkling some cold water on it have yourself a small tall spoonful of this and just spread this up on your on your pan to the size you need and once you have done that go ahead and put the cover on it so that those are steams and makes a nice crisp from the top and the bottom those are is out so we're going to do a second one here again sprinkle water on it and then wipe it off you have a nice clean frypan take one of this set it in and just spread it see how easily it spreads the spread it there we go that's a perfect spread there and then we'll go ahead and cover this up and if you would like playing those I hear you would just spring out put that the oil or the Desi Ghee and could let it crisp from the bottom and you can remove it fold it or remove it like that and that would be your plain dosa okay so now what I'm looking is this about three ounce a minute or so I'm looking some brown specks on my dough soft and that's I know is it's ready to be removed that cover you can see how nicely it has fluffed up and the holes you know those are what you are looking for I'm using daesik here feel free to use the oil if you want this sprinkle some on this and then I'm going to take about a tablespoon of my potato filling which I made further dosa and I'm going to just set it right in the center there may be a little more there right in the center and then I'm going to cover this again for about you know I would say it ten seconds or so and I'm still waiting on that to turn a little more nice and brown and the basic he can nicely mold in it and once that is done okay so I think it's ready to come out and what do you do is you just take this those I see how it's leaving the sides and off and that's the technique what you use for spraying the water or not and just go ahead and close this dosa so we're going to close it from one side and then close it from the other side and just take it out in in a plate so that's here those are which has come out again for watching this here Roma this video was for the masala dosa you know trying to you love it and please put in your comments for us to read and suggestions if you have any also I want to thank you all for subscribing to my channel please keep the subscription coming so we know you love us I feel good
