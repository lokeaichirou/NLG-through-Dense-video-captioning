 hi welcome to Lenz recipes today I want to show you my version of chicken parmesan this is a pretty easy recipe that doesn't take very long to make and it makes a really good dinner to make this chicken parmesan these are the ingredients that you're going to need you're going to need some thin cut chicken breasts and it must store it's labeled chicken cutlets and you can use as many as you need for the amount of people you're going to feed you're also going to need some all-purpose flour and I have put some salt and ground pepper in this and mixed it up you'll need some beaten eggs mixed with a little bit of water and I just whisk that together you'll need Italian bread crumbs you'll need about 48 ounces of tomato sauce and you can make your own tomato sauce or use jarred it doesn't matter you'll need about 6 ounces of sliced mozzarella cheese and you'll need some freshly grated Parmesan cheese also we're going to serve us with spaghetti and I'm just going to cook that according to the package directions to get started making this Parmesan chicken the first thing we're going to do is we're going to dredge the chicken and the flour the egg and the Italian breadcrumbs so let me show you how to do that it's pretty easy you just make sure that each side of the chicken gets a little bit of the flour on it shake it off a little bit move over to the egg dip both sides and then we're going to move over to the breadcrumbs and make sure that it's very well coated on both sides and then I'll just set it aside on a dish so I'm going to finish doing this chicken and so when we get done with the last piece we're going to take it over to the stove and we've got a skillet that's going to have olive oil in it we're going to heat it up and we're going to brown both sides of this chicken okay so I'll put a little bit of the breading in to make sure that olive oil is hot enough and so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add my chicken to the olive oil and brown it scoot it around to make room for all of it that's the last piece so we're going to let it brown and then I'm going to turn it over and brown the other side okay so now I'm going to assemble the dish the first thing I'm going to do is I have a 9 by 13 inch several dish that I've sprayed and I'm going to put some of my sauce in the bottom of it and on simply just going to lay my chicken on top of the salt okay so now what I'm going to do is put a little bit more sauce on top of the chicken and I am going to use the rest of the sauce I'm going to put it in a saucepan and I'm going to heat it up and we're going to serve it over our pasta later on so then what we do is we take our mozzarella cheese and you would just lay it on top then I'm going to sprinkle my parmesan on top of that you can use as much of this as you want it's up to your taste and then I think I'm going to just drizzle a little bit of olive oil on top of the cheeses okay now what I'm going to do is put this in a 350 degree preheated oven for about 30 minutes my chicken parmesan is done it cooked for about 30 minutes and this is what it looks like it's nice and golden on the top so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to give my spaghetti and I'm going to put it all on the serving plate and then I'll come back and show you what it looks like this is my version of chicken parmesan I hope you enjoy it you
