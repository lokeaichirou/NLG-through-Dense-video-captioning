 hi everyone the chef Mooney here I've got a bit of a challenge today I'm going on a quest to find some mussels and it wasn't really planned I didn't plan to do this today but I was chatting to Steve from Steve cooking and they're having trouble on the other side of the world trying to find some local mussels for their restaurants and we're gonna go right now to find some mussels so we're off to a little place called carom downs and in carom downs there's a beautiful seafood place they have fresh seafood oysters and I'm hoping they're gonna have some mussels so we'll see we'll see apparently on the other side of the world as Steve was saying and Steve's wife was saying too that they just can't get them there they're all farmed out and there's a bit of a struggle there so perhaps I can I think they want 700 kilos 70 kilos they need a lot of mussels seafood okay so we've got Pete here and he's gonna we went we went on the quest for muscles at now these muscles are from analyzer so they're like it was about the muscle so therefore fill of a Port Phillip Bay okay they're a fossil beautiful so we I've been on the quest to find some muscles to show people on the other side of the world that we can get them so Australia's beautiful secret and lilies I've purchased two kilos of these so I'm going to have a nice recipe this afternoon and thanks to the staff here and so the fish market and your name sorry again hey there so thanks Peter thank you very much for us so we'll get our muscles in look we go so there you go fresh muscles what did I get two kilos and I bought some beautiful fish as well Pete's a lovely guy he I think he likes being on camera actually I think he was very very happy to go on camera and that was great I wasn't sure there's a bit of a should i film them or shouldn't i filmed them it's actually quite nerve-wracking filming people I was actually quite nervous and he said oh I've never been on camera before said oh well I gave him a link to my YouTube channel and so we're gonna feature this we're gonna we're gonna put this on youtube for this on YouTube okay Suns coming out I've got two kilos of muscles to cook now thanks to Steve's cooking and his lovely wife and are they're gonna be so jealous let's get back into the kitchen ok so now we've got all our muscles back from our wonderful day out now I've cleaned them you want to make sure that you press them when you press them together that they actually stay together if they don't that means they're dead and need to toss them out you have two deep beard them which means you've got to take that funny sort of beardy thing off the side here and you just tear that off give them a scrub with some nice water and they can see this one here it's just starting to open we're gonna close him and just give him a few seconds and as you can see it is you can see that he's already closed up again so that means that one is still alive so you need to go through make sure that you don't have any dead ones in there so they've checked all of those so I've got a kilo of mussels here and we're just going to go over the ingredients what we're going to use you're gonna need a sort of a large saucepan here and you're going to also need a lid on top of that but for the ingredients what you're gonna do is have half an onion I've got three cloves of garlic you can add more or less if you wish now I did say I was gonna do some coriander or use some coriander I'm actually using some dill which I had some beautiful dill left over but I think that's gonna go really nice with the tomato over here is just a crushed tomato and you can just use a crushed tomato or a tomato sauce or a jar sauce or you can finely chopped tomatoes if you want to there's a whole bunch of things you can do I'm going to add just a small little knob of butter we're gonna put some olive oil in there first to get things moving and of course chilli and we're gonna top it off with some that's an episode tight here which is a nice Chardonnay into our pan we're going to put some oil I'm gonna put about three tablespoons and then straight in with our onion plus in that novel butter just give it a bit of a stir around we just want to cook those onions just about halfway through so now I love garlic I'm adding three cloves of chopped garlic you can add less if you like straight in with your clean muscles nice fresh dill save a little bit for the garnish on the top just a sprinkle and some nice chili flakes in there if you had fresh chili that would be fantastic hit it now with just a drizzle of white wine as they begin to cook the mussels should start to open  that around I'm going to add a good that around I'm going to add a good couple of spoons of the crushed tomato at four maybe five at the crushed tomato get that across through then put your nice tight lid on there and just cook those through you know keep an eye on then give it a bit of a shake every now and again these don't take long to cook at all it's a very very quick easy simple entree and it just is so colorful and delicious looking good they can see this starting to open okay these are ready now you know when they're ready because they all start to open out so what I'm going to do now I'm going to serve them up this is a very impressive dish because you've got all these beautiful colors okay the sauce has reduced enough now still a pouring consistency and you don't want it too thick because you want it to sort of drizzle through all of those muscles so we're just going to pour it over the top finish off with a sprinkle of your fresh fennel so there you have my chili mussels with a beautiful gorgeous dill drizzle through there with some garlic a little bit of olive oil splash of wine these mussels fresh today and you saw where they came from and it's an absolute look at that doesn't add up gorgeous absolutely perfectly cooked they're not shriveled up they're nice and fresh they taste amazing I hope you've enjoyed this video today and had a chance to have a look around my little neck of the woods you take care have a great week and I'll see you on crispy nice first bullabbai okay there
