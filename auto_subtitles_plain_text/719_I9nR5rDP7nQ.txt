 I'd like a warm spring showers they're kind of freshened up everything certainly reminds me of when I was in holiday in southern Italy sitting down on the side of the street there in Calabria please call malaterre drinking a glass of wine and eating a plate of crispy calamari and I got the recipe I'm going to share that with you now and very very simple now what we've got to do is I'm gonna add about six hours 175 grams of self-raising flour all right now I'm just shaking and you can weigh it out if you want enter that I'm going to sprinkle in a little bit of salt and then a teaspoon of paprika so I thought paprika is nice to also give you that lovely color to sit and then to that we're going to add 8 fluid ounces or if you like 250 milliliters of cold water that is and sit just create a little well in the middle there pour some of that water in about a third of it and then just stir that around and keep stirring there that's it here we are that's it you can see that's thickening up and what you're looking for for me is a kind of a like a heavy double sort of cream consistency of course just let that rest a little bit now I've got some squid here I'll just cling film that ox I didn't want all those smells of the fish to kind of linger out all through your fridge there that often happens isn't it now squids look at these look at that tube isn't it a wonderful tube there yeah hello are you doing well Oh lol oh and you just cut that into strips and you can see here that little crunch of the back there that means that a little bit of cartilage sometimes you get that in the corner that comes in lots of different shapes all these little sort of it looks like something you get in a with toys isn't it one of those little plastic things and then we're just going to cut those the rest of that inch strips very very simple when with gloves the slightly smaller ones you can also cut those in rings but just cut that a little bit on the angle there and then you've got these little bits here with the tentacles and right at the end there you've got a plastic bit called the beak which you can just snap off like that there you go perfect a couple of tablespoons of flour just sprinkle it like that and slightly soft toss it using your fingers pop those straight into your batter just give that a bit of a shake bit like Georgia there isn't it talking about the waves of the sea in his risotto delightful I like to the idea of using the tongs here that really does help when you want to pick up your piece of car Mari and plunge them into your fryer a little bit of control movement there and that's it look at those lovely straight in there here we are just like on working at a chipper yeah and just let those up away that won't take very long and that's literally gonna take about three or four minutes I've got some lovely fresh limes and lemons over here and what I do is I cut the cheeks of these all right so it's about there you see what I mean about that little cheeks I think they're about ready to come out now justic and look close lovely a little bit of a tap look at that all comes off and that is perfect that's okay and just sort of step those up pile those up the nonchalant way in there like there there we are and then serve that with the little wedges of lemons and limes I think that it's just fantastic like that just look at that isn't that great beautiful
