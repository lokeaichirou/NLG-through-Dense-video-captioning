 this is the the piece of kombu they come in long strips of you and they need about the 10 centimeter square so cut it and snip a few extra bits in to the deflator all come through and then you soak it in water that's one I put in about half an hour ago and the sauce goes back to its probably its original size and we bought that away probably on sort of medium heat so when you start seeing little bubbles come up from the side of the kombu hmm then that's when it's ready for you to take the kombu out now this is the bonito so it's a piece of the fish that's being boiled and smoked and dried sort of looks like a prosciutto almost almost yeah and you have this really nice shiny meat inside hmm and this is the special shaving tool careful with your fingers but that's how you do it and then end up with a flake cinder Oh Adam and then you put the bonito flakes in so is that like one cup of bonito flakes oh so two big handfuls and the heat back on mmm just sort of when you start seeing the little bubbles and then turn that off and then just let it sit and wait till the goose or the flex sink to the bottom of the pan mmm and then we just strain it through that's it what's beautiful that's the basic stock general rule of missile is the darker the color of the missile they're sort of stronger and sharper the flavor and light rail is sweeter and milder so that's sort of halfway so too there's not a leader of stocking has probably plenty of missile so you start off with a small amount and what you do you just melt them you saw in nice and easy and there you go that's stopped turning to mr. suit any seasonal vegetable can be added to make a hearty soup Yuki's favorite additions a wakame and tofu we just have to UM heat it through well mmm sorry what mmm that is really good you
