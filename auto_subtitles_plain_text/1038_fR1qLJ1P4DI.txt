hilton's fitprez.com and parazitos.com so in this nutritional episode i'm going to share with you guys a fantastic recipe that i just found on haley duff's website real realgirlskitchen.com now if you haven't checked out her website i highly recommend that you do so because she's got a lot of delicious recipes that use authentic ingredients that contribute to health so we are going to be making a salad that she recently posted on her website it's a spicy fatouche salad and you can serve it with some pita bread you can bake it in the oven maybe add a little olive oil to that bread and you can also just eat the salad alone just as it is because it's delicious it uses authentic clean ingredients that are loaded with vitamins and minerals and it's so easy and delicious that your whole family is gonna love it even picky eaters so let's talk about what goes into this amazing salad first of all you're gonna need some romaine lettuce i would say anywhere from one to two cups depending on how much leafy green veggies you want to put in it and romaine lettuce is fabulous because it's a good source of vitamin c of beta-carotene iron calcium folate and dietary fiber which is important for maintaining a healthy digestive system in addition to the romaine lettuce you're going to need one cucumber this is a big one so i'm probably going to just use about half of that and cucumbers are fantastic because they're loaded with potassium mag magnesium fiber folate vitamin a and we're also going to use about one or two tomatoes i'm going to use three of these fresh tomatoes here tomatoes are a great source of lyzapine which is great for promoting or for preventing prostate cancer and a vitamin c and antioxidants so they're going to help keep you well as we go through cold and flu season we're also going to use about one cup of fresh radishes i love radishes i snack on them all the time because they're loaded with vitamin c they're also a good source of fiber of phosphorus and zinc and we're going to use the juice from about half of a lemon so it's going to give our our dish a little added boost of vitamin c in addition to all these ingredients we're going to use about half a cup of flat leaf parsley i love parsley because not only does it promote fresh breath it's also a great source of vitamins k c and a and folate so we love that and we're going to add a little bit about half a cup of fresh dill dill is awesome because it's full of manganese iron and magnesium and about i'd say half a cup of fresh mint and mint is great not only because it tastes amazing and helps to freshen your breath but it's also great for soothing upset stomach and it can help with headaches so we've got a lot of fantastic ingredients that promote health that we're going to put into this dish okay so i've gone ahead and i thoroughly washed all my ingredients i've chopped up all the vegetables you can see that i've got a beautiful mixture of the romaine lettuce in here the chopped up cucumbers about two uh full ripe chopped up tomatoes you can also use heirloom tomatoes to give it a nice beautiful color to the salad so i've got this mixture here i'm gonna go ahead and dump in my dill just kind of give it a nice sprinkle i love the dill because it gives it such a refreshing clean taste almost like a summer salad which is perfect for these dark dreary months then i'm going to go ahead and add my mint all chopped up so beautiful give it a nice fresh taste i love radishes i actually use a lot more radishes just because they're so delicious crispy and like we've talked about they're a great source of vitamin c so i went ahead and i've added that to my mixture and of course the flat leaf parsley it really complements the mint nicely and gives the salad a nice cool crisp texture so i'm going to go ahead and squeeze in my lemon just a little bit kind of eyeball it i love citrus so i'm going to add a little bit more again lemon gives the salad a nice healthy dose of vitamin c and just for something extra this wasn't in haley's original recipe but i'm going to go ahead and add about a tablespoon of black chia seeds just to give it some added protein some omega-3 fatty acids and a nice boost of calcium potassium and magnesium so we love chia seeds you won't even taste it just adds a little bit of texture to this salad uh next i'm going to go ahead and dump in my olive oil just plain cold pressed organic oil olive oil is the best way to go i'm going to use some spicy some spicy just seasoning you can get anything that really suits your flavor your palette just kind of dash it on in there some sea salt a little bit of sea salt there and sea salt is great because it's got trace minerals so we always are looking for ways to incorporate more minerals here's some black pepper and just give it a nice toss there and it's so beautiful with the radishes the chia seeds really give it a nice texture a nice depth and voila there's your salad super easy to make not a lot of ingredients not a lot of prep time full of nutrients lots of vitamins lots of minerals and almost everybody in your family is probably going to love this i know a lot of picky eaters especially kids that are huge fans of the salad and they don't even know that they're eating health food so thank you hailey for this awesome recipe again be sure to check out her
