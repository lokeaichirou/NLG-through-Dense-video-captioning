 hi my name is a kami I'm going to show you how to make sushi with nigiri sushi maker what it does is basically a mold so you stuff the rice sushi rice inside of the mold and then press it down so this makes to sushi instantly what you need is a ball of water in order to keep your hands wet so the rice won't stick to you and of course you need sushi rice we have nori which is seaweed and fresh summer wasabi and sushi ginger well first of all you need to cut sushi nori into a strip this is how you do it as you can see there's a line running along the nori this is how you fold it along the line it will come apart by folding it off like this take this piece you need scissors for this one just make very fine strips of about one centimeter this is going to bind the sushi together with the summer at any time keep the seaweed away from the water otherwise it will shrink okay I think we are ready to make sushi get them all get your hand wet good idea to keep the mold slightly wet the towel so you want rice won't stick take some rice and start stuffing then take the pusher and push it down simple as that take this out and then when you turn it around you have tabs one on each either end so you just gently place thumbs over the top and press just push it down like that now you have a couple of city rights there might be slightly jaunty so just take take them away next thing you do is that ply wasabi on the back of the fish then Tarley upside down so the wasabi side is hidden in order to make it pretty I'll also to make it bind together so they won't fall apart is to have seaweed strip over it and then gently wrap it around they will stick naturally because of the moisture that's coming from the rice and fish here we are pop them into the plate and serve it with sushi ginger on the side and soy sauce
