 hi everybody I'm chatty and you're watching so this kitchen count today in my kitchen I'm going to show you a very very popular snack samosas these can be filled with any stuffing of your choice today I'm going to make delicious potato stuffing to go along with this samosas and this is going to be really yummy and I'm going to show you how you get the crispy texture for the outer layer so let's quickly start with the recipe first go through the ingredients later I'll show you the step by step procedure of making the samosas for making the dough you need 1 cup of all-purpose flour maida quarter teaspoon of adjuvant carom seeds three tablespoons of oil salt to taste and you also need some water to knead the dough you need a very little amount of water we want tight and stiff dough for the samosas and for the stuffing you need three medium sized boiled potatoes house lightly mash them quarter teaspoon of cumin powder quarter teaspoon of coriander powder a generous pinch of asafoetida hing 2 tablespoons of oil 1/2 teaspoon of mustard seeds 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin seeds salt to taste quarter teaspoon of turmeric powder quarter teaspoon of garam masala powder green chillies finely chopped to taste quarter teaspoon of finely chopped onion and you also need three tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro for deep frying the samosas you need some oil so you can use any one such as vegetable oil or even the canola oil so let's start by preparing the dough first so into the wide bowel I'm going to add in the all-purpose flour followed by a drain salt and most important oil this oil that we are going to add it to the flour it helps in developing nice flakiness into the samosas very important ingredient and I'm going to mix father's oil into the flour as you see you could see some crumb texture into this flour after adding the oil into the flour this is how you want if you want you could even add any kind of facts such as clarified butter or even the butter husband I'm going to add a little bit of water at a time and make a very tight dough out of it but for meaning the do I just used quarter cup of water nothing more than that we want it tight and stepped out of it make sure that you get everything out from the corners of the mouth and make it very stiff dough out of this and finally I'm going to coat it with just few drops of oil and I'm going to cover this until we are ready with the stuffing so now let's start preparing the stuffing so into a wide bowel I'm going to start by heating up the oil I'm going to season it once the oil is nice and hot I'm going to start by adding the mustard seeds allow them to pop completely and pardon the cumin seeds pinch of hing turmeric powder Arnon yes let the onion get cooked which should be nice and soft you can pretty much add any kind of masala like chaat masala or even the lemon juice the pepper powder you can spice it up the way you like but here I got the coriander powder and the cumin powder going to dump enough Pulido and I mix the potato along with the onion and the masala you can use the same stuffing inside the dosa or even the hollow funda the stuffing can also go into the puff pastry sheets and make tops but of this so there are n number of ways to use this stuffing so finally to finish this off I'm going to carve it down lots of cilantro and the garam masala powder and mix it through cilantro adds a great flavor and the place of cilantro you could reduce the amount and even hard in the mint for a different flavor literally you can go crazy about how you mean to masala anyhow it tastes great because of the potatoes and last but not least and one to add in the salt and mix it through if you want you could even add in some lemon juice along with the salt as well so our flavorful potato filling is all ready you could even give it a taste test and you can adjust according to your preference salt and even a spices mine is just perfect I'm going to turn off the heat this is all ready I'm going to take it out from the pan let it cool completely before stuffing it to the samosa so it's been a while now I have my stuffing ready it has cooled down completely and the dough is looking nice and beautiful let's start dividing the dough into small balls I'm going to make one inch round balls out of it because we are going to make small samosas bite-sized samosas which I like so give it a final neat so you might probably get about six to eight dumplings out of it so there I have six balls I'm just going to smoothen them and start rolling into chapatis and we are going to divide each capacity into two parts and later shape them into samosas I am working with one dumpling I'm going to cover the remaining because we don't want them to dry up and you could even dust it with the dry all-purpose flour now I am going to start rolling into five inch diameter circle I'm going to divide this into two and I'm going to see this like this if it's not getting sealed properly you could even coat it with little bit of water but my dough is looking beautiful I don't need any additional water for this just stick it carefully so that it's completely sealed and you get a cone on top when you invert it so into this portion I am going to add in the pareto filling as I told you you can use any filling of your choice and I'm going to pull this up a little bit so that I will be able to see this make sure that you're sealing it properly so after you seal it completely like so over here I'm going to make a plate and they can present so there you have beautiful samosa ready and similarly you can do the same way with the remaining butter as well make sure that you seal everything properly I'm going to fry them up in two batches my oil is already going on low to medium make sure that you're frying on low to medium only otherwise they don't turn out crispy so I'm just going to carefully slide all these samosas one by one into the moderately hot oil and as I told you I'm going to do this frying in two batches and we are going to wait till these samosas float on top of the oil so after five minutes I'm going to increase the flame to medium and cook for 5 more minutes basically we want them to cook from inside out we want them to be nice and flaky and they should be nice and crispy now as you see they are beautifully golden I'm going to take them off from the pan and I'm going to follow the same thing with the remaining samosas as well so there I have my yummy and crispy samosas and I wanted to show you how crispy they are I'm going to give it a bite they're super hot they are very crispy and they are amazing so there are my crunchy and flavorful samosas these are really crispy I hope you all had a great time
