 hi guys remember last week when Cheryl boat-car came on and we made that delicious healthy food well if you want more healthy food stay tuned because her series eat clean is starting right now what's clean eating anywhere it means eating whole unprocessed foods so you'll maximize your energy and optimize your health I'm Cheryl bow car host of eat clean join me as I create simple healthy delicious homemade meals that will inspire you to eat clean and feel your best soup for breakfast might sound unusual but in many Asian countries like Japan and Vietnam and China that's the way the day get started and this vegetable miso soup has everything you need to power through your day we have chickpeas for protein miso for a probiotic kick let's get cooking to get started heat a medium pot over medium heat then add a couple tablespoons of olive oil and then we're going to start with our mirepoix this is that delicious blend of half a chopped onion 2 cloves of garlic 2 stalks of celery chopped and two carrots chopped and just cook this until the vegetables have softened and they smell really wonderful now I always like to season a little bit as I'm going and I find that this just helps build the flavor now one of the reasons I love the idea of a breakfast soup is that I often run into a breakfast rut you know you can only have yogurt and granola or toast and eggs so many days in a row and this is just a nice way to freshen up your routine it's also a great way to get your vegetables in the morning my vegetables are sizzling away here they smell wonderful one cup of cooked chickpeas and one cup of chopped broccoli cook this for just a couple of minutes the broccoli will turn bright green it smells great and add four cups of water and the great thing that I love about a homemade soup is that you know everything that's going in there these are all whole ingredients and then just increase the heat to high you want to bring this mixture to a boil so I'm just gonna let this soup simmer away for about ten minutes until the broccoli is nice tender we don't want to cook it too much my vegetables are perfectly cooked now it's time to add the miso when you're adding miso to hot liquids you want to make sure that they're not boiling so I'm taking two tablespoons of miso two tablespoons of water and just whisking and whisk it until it becomes softened this also helps incorporate it into your dish a lot faster so miso is a fermented product and that means there's lots of beneficial microorganisms and you don't want to blast them with lots of high heat and that's why we're tempering it into our soup after it's simmered and one of the reasons I love using miso not just a soup but another cooking is that it's really nutrient dense you have lots of probiotics and it's full of amino acids and another really important thing when you're cooking with miso is to taste before you season with salt because me so is naturally high in sodium so you really only need just a little bit of salt okay let's eat oh this broth smells so good let's trap so delicious healthy breakfast is a guaranteed way to have an energetic morning you
