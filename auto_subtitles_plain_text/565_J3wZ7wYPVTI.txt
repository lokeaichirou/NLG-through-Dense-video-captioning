 hey guys many of you have been asking me for more vegetarian recipes so I thought I would share with you one of my favorite appetizer ideas homemade hummus hummus is one of those things that is always going to taste better homemade and when you see how quick and easy it comes together you're gonna be making it all design let me show you how to make so the first thing we're gonna do is rinse our chickpeas now you may also know these as garbanzo beans it's the same thing so go ahead and drain them into a strainer give them a rinse and just rinse them off now for our garnish we're gonna want to make sure that we take at least mm about a tablespoon of chickpeas and put them on the side we're gonna top our hummus with them after they're done so you want to make sure you set those aside then we're gonna take our chickpeas and put them in a food processor so for me the mark of a great tasting hummus is a smooth and creamy hummus and a food processor is really gonna help with that so go ahead and give them a whirl you just want to make sure that they're nice and sort of cut up they don't need to be completely pureed at this stage we just want to give them a head start then we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of water puree that again we're just trying to get those chickpeas nice and smooth next we're gonna add some tahini about two-thirds cup now if you're not familiar with tahini it is a delicious 12 in each case you find it in the aisle next to the peanut butter now if you've never worked with it before and you open your jar don't be startled if you see a bunch of oil on top that's actually what happens to tahini when it's it's firm you could just go in with your knife and give it a stir and you will reincorporate all of that oil back into the sesame paste and then we're also going to add half a cup of lemon juice then you're going to add two garlic cloves one and a half teaspoons of salt and two teaspoons of cumin I love the cumin because it adds a really wonderful sort of exotic taste to the hummus pop the top on our food processor and give it a whirl for at least two to three minutes you cannot process it too long we're really looking for a smooth and creamy goodness and that just takes some time on the food processor so not to worry just sit back and let it work then at this point we are going to slowly add 1/2 a cup of olive oil you could do this with the machine running and just pour it into the shoe and you'll see that that hummus will become creamier and smoother as you add the oil now at this stage you want to check your hosts now depending on how you like it it's really personal preference if you like a weightier hummers your hummus could be done if you like one that's more spreadable you probably want to add about two tablespoons more of liquid and at this point the choice is yours you like really tangy hummus with a lot of lemon juice you could add two tablespoons of lemon juice but really what I do because I do like the lemon juice or you could add two tablespoons of water or two tablespoons more of all choice is yours so at this point you want to transfer your hummus to a bowl I have to spread it with a spatula because then you'll get some nice texture in your hummus you're gonna drizzle with a little bit more olive oil on top sprinkle with some cumin top with some chopped flat-leaf parsley and then we're gonna add our remaining chickpeas on top and you see you'll have a beautiful looking sentence now at this point you could serve your hummus with some pita chips a bagel tips and I really like to serve it with some grilled pita bread now you could just heat it up in the microwave or the oven but I do think grilling it really kicks it up a notch so you're gonna just brush it with a little olive oil on both sides you can even Susan with a little bit of salt then you're going to grill it either a barbecue or an indoor grill on both sides and then you can cut it into tracks then to serve I really live to serve hummus like this in the summertime and a big cutting board and I am a big fan of raghu's cutting boards I recently saw that they had this roll nut style and I just loved it and it makes for a great chopping block but it also makes for a great serving piece if you want to serve an appetizer enlist the help if you want to know where to get one the link is in the description I love this recipe because even though it's vegetarian everybody loves a great homemade hooks and remember for the full printed recipe you can head over to entertaining with Beth calm or you can also find it here in the video description below I'll see you guys back here next week for another delicious recipe until then [Music]
