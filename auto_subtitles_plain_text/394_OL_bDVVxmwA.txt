 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchen today we're going to be making hot dogs I love them I love eating hot dogs when you're watching some football or any other sort of sport or if it's just for a packed lunch or taking them down to the beach they're fantastic so we're going to make hot dogs today but there's a bit of a twist okay hot dogs they are fantastic at anytime anywhere any place and we're going to make him today but like I said there's a bit of a twist we're gonna make stuffed hot dogs in that we're gonna stuff our sausage with cheese and onion and sauce now usually it all goes over the top and you know it falls apart everywhere well we're actually gonna put it inside our sausage and then we're gonna wrap our sausage in bacon okay so here's what you're gonna need get - or like I said you can you know you can get any sort of sausages you want and as and as many as you want I'm just gonna do two today okay one rack one rasher of bacon cut in half we're going to use a sharp knife to cut them in half okay you're gonna need some onion some chopped onion you're gonna need some salt and pepper we're gonna need some a bit of clean this up the right way some tomato ketchup and some Dijon mustard or you can use American mustard if you want to and this is optional I love it sauerkraut now all it is is cabbage salt and water okay you can buy them in the can sometimes I make it myself it's okay but it's just as easy to get in the can it's pretty good so get some sauerkraut if you want to if you don't want to leave it out and we're also gonna use some cheddar cheese now what I want you to do with the cheese is cut a slice off okay just cut it straight down there and then cut it in the middle into sticks like that so we're gonna stuff our sausage there with some cheese in the middle that's just gonna go all gooey and melt all over the cheese and it's gonna be wrapped up in the bacon and of course okay some hot dog rolls get the sesame seed ones I think they're really nice and just kind of in half and later on we'll toast these guys okay I'll show you how to do it alrighty guys first thing first we just want to make our sauce that we're going to put in the sausages here so we're gonna get some Dijon mayonaise I stay here squeeze of that not too much and equal half of tomato ketchup we'll just put that straight in there housing right doesn't make a great noise don't worry about the effect okay we're going to mix that up like that instead of having them separate we're gonna add them together let's give it a good mix it's a great color to that sort of light orangey reddish color it's really nice okay that's the sauce now we're going to cut our sausages okay you get a really sharp knife okay and tip first I'm just gonna make an incision and just cut like that you don't to go all the way through okay and we just want to go up to about there just make an incision like that and just pull it apart okay so we've got something like that okay with a little pocket inside the sausage don't go just go up to about there okay and don't go all the way down okay now that we've done our sausages you're just gonna spoon some of the sauce in there okay just like that just be really gentle with them take a bit of care with this okay now this might seem a bit of work and you know doing this for a few people but let me tell you it is well worth it okay we got our sauce we want to put it out cheese just put it right down the bottom there and you go just like that cover it up with a bit of sauce okay my hands no no we just want to add little bits of onion in there as well just put your toothpick straight through there that'll just hold the bacon in okay now you get your bacon and just lift up your sausage just wrap it around until you get to the end and we'll get another toothpick I'll put that one in straight through there so it holds in that one so that's your sausage there guys wrapped in bacon do it to the other one and then we'll put them on the grill okay guys that's what you wanted to look like alright just wrapped in bacon pick him up by the forks just there by the toothpicks okay and that's where you wanted to look like now we're going to put them on a pretty hot grill with some oil in it okay we'll go to our cast iron griddle pan just to you again that nice and hot put some oil in it just some vegetable oil and we're going to put our stuff sausages straight on there like that okay and we're gonna put our other sausage on there yeah like that okay everyone the oil Dakotah through now you want to cook these babies for more I don't know about a couple minutes on each side or you know maybe three minutes on each side you will get you know obviously some bit of onions that will just fall out but most of it will stay in there okay don't worry about it but all that cheese is gonna melt when the heat comes through and that Bacon's gonna be crispy the sausages are gonna be absolutely beautiful they are packed full of flavor hot dogs are cooking nicely that's a nice color just ear and the hot dog here is all cooking nicely got the couple of little pieces going in there to pull it off but I've just turned these and they're going to be done and probably another couple of minutes and then we'll put them in our hot dog bones now if you want to toast your hot dog buns I would do them right now at this stage if not just leave them and then we'll assemble them pretty soon okay now it's time to assemble okay just on the bottom there you can see all that cheese is all gooey and melted and looking lovely okay I'll just pull the toothpicks out your bacon will stay right there because it's now attached to it now like I said you can put a bit of extra sauce and this is optional I'm putting some sauerkraut just over the top which is just some cabbage and water and a little bit of vinegar I'm just gonna put that over the top and I think I've got some of this sauce left over what I'll do is I'll just drizzle that over the top just like that just because I had some left over and it's really yummy and that my friends is one hell of a hot dog so there you have it folks Nikko's hot dogs they're gooey with that cheese with young yin with the sauce and the tender made the crispy bacon I don't know about you but life doesn't get much better than that you take care and I'll see you next time
