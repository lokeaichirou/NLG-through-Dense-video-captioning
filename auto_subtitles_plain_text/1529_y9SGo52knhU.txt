 hi guys Carrie Anne here I'm going to show you a recipe from my batch cooking chapter in my book it's a roasted tomato soup it's really really easy it's really really delicious and if you make a big pot of it on the weekend it freezes really really well so for those days when you don't feel like cooking grab it out the freezer defrost it everyone's winner right so first of all I've preheated an oven to 220 degrees or gas mark 7 and now I'm gonna take two kilos of these beautiful tomatoes and I'm just gonna cut them in half and put them lovingly in this roasting tray I'm gonna chop the vines in as well that will give a really really intense tomato flavor to your soup once you've roasted them down we're gonna put them in the trade cut side up so that when we season them they'll get all that lovely seasoning net the great thing about roasting Tomatoes is that when they're in a really nice hot oven they start to get all caramelized around the edges where the natural sugars start to cook in the tomatoes and then they get really sweet and sticky and then they become almost jammy and then the flavor is like triple concentrated and it's just tomatoes in paradise right so that's all of my tomorrows and my vines in the nice solid roasting tray now I need a bulb of garlic and I'm literally just gonna put it on the board and cut it in half like that and then I'm gonna put that in the tray as well and all the ones that have come loose skin stalks everything goes in and then I'm gonna need about 8 to 10 sprigs of fresh thyme and then we're gonna break it up a little bit and then what will happen is while this is all roasting the flavors from the garlic and the thyme will infuse with the tomatoes and all the juices that will collect at the bottom and now I need to add about 4 tablespoons of olive oil and just drizzle it over now I know 4 tablespoons it might sound like a lot but remember this is gonna make a lot of soup and it's going to serve about eight people so now the final touch just a small pinch of salt remember salts not that great for kids so we don't want to use too much and a generous pinch of freshly ground black pepper now I'm going to put this in the oven at 220 gas mark 7 which has already been preheated for about 25 to 30 minutes our tomatoes are beautifully ready come and have a look you'll see that they just starting to capture around the edges and they've sort of gone all sticky and squidgy and soft now what we want to do is we want to take out all these time stalks and the vines squeeze the garlic out of its skin because that garlic now is all sweet and sticky as well so we don't want to waste it but the skin won't blend up very well in the soup so we're just going to take that out right so we're going to transfer this over to a nice heavy bottomed pan now to that I want to add one point seven litres of vegetable stock right so what we want to do is we want to bring that to the boil and then we want to turn it down and let it simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes just so the tomatoes can take on the flavor of the stock and the stock can take on the flavor of the tomatoes and the garlic it would be one big party in your pot so I'll see you in about 20 to 25 minutes right so this has been simmering away for about 25 minutes now if you come and have a look you'll see that the tomatoes have started to break down into the liquid and then the liquid started to turn a lovely orange color I've got a nice basil plant here so I'm going to leave the nice pretty leaves at the top for serving and then I'm going to put the wrist near enough a bunch of basil into the suit now we've got the buzz win what I want to do is I want to use one of these lovely stick blenders and I'm just gonna blitz this up until it's nice and smooth put it back on a low heat and simmer it gently for another 25 to 30 minutes just because we want it to reduce down a bit more get a little bit thicker and let those flavors intensify even more so I'll see you in about half hour so friends this has been bubbling away nicely for about half an hour now if you come in and have a look you'll see that it's reduced right down this line here is where it started so it's reduced down by that much and I'm going to show you how thickened and lovely it is so it's thickened right up so we're ready now to serve and a nice bowl now and do you remember earlier on we kept this basal plot with all these little teeny tiny basil leaves we just want to scatter a few over the top just for that fresh basil flavor nice bit of color as well and then a knife pinch of freshly ground pepper just to wake it all up a little bit and there you have it my friends my roasted tomato soup don't forget to like it if you liked it subscribe if you want it is free and but in the meantime enjoy yourselves have fun and I'll see you next time happy cooking you
