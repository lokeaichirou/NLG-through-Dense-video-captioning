 hey guys thanks stop by ballistic BBQ and welcome to the latest installation of my great burger Recreation series I've received a bunch of requests to do Five Guys burger I agree Five Guys killer burger secret to their success is keeping it simple they don't have a big crazy menu the ingredients are very very fresh and that's we're going to try to do here so without any further ado let's get started first I want to cover the toppings that I like to choose when I go to Five Guys I personally like to keep my burgers they're kind of simple and that's we're going to do I'm going to basically make my burger exactly how I order it at Five Guys and we're going to go with ketchup mustard mayo onions which I'm going to grill up tomato some hand leaf lettuce and some nice American deli style cheese this is not you know the type that comes wrapped in plastic let's get to making those patties now alright so obviously I have two patties of 80/20 some parchment laid out what I'm going to do is place this now five guys they're using like three and half ounces I don't have a scale so I don't know what just wanted to keep on me even this is for me anyway I'm not making any money on these things anyway they actually stack theirs for high and I think that's just for production reasons alright now what they use is this big like stainless steel trowel thing to flatten them I'm going to use my old burger Smasher from my smash burger video and I'm going to smash it see what happens here yep looks pretty good a little bit more all right let's get these things out to the grill all right so let's get these burgers going here and this is you know regular 80/20 ground beef thank you have five guys you know one of their claims is the twice ground beef this is just ground beef they do not season their patties they just I think they're just letting the meat do the talkin here now I'm going to grill some onion I don't know whether they put oil or not but I'm not growing 500 onions here so I need a little bit of you know help moisture so they'll be able to get right out [Music] Bunz these are sesame seed buns but that i luckily found these they have a little bit more of an eggy ER base than you know your regular bun so they're not you know like your typical white bread bun [Music] and he's on the package it was you know gourmet restaurant style buns and these are pretty similar to what Five Guys uses [Music] oh you know very nice man you cannot ask for better Chris Annette [Music] those are good [Music] all right guys let's let's get all this goodness into the house and we'll make some burgers here all right so five guys has a very specific way of dressing the burgers there you go with three rings ketchup on the bottom two rings of mustard on the bottom bye [Applause] you want to go with our grilled onions you know top line Mayo yes five pickles one two three or and what their thought is they want you to get a bite in every bite of everything in every bite and then two slices of tomato right now for the burger cheese got a little bit more melted than theirs just because it you know while I was sitting the cameras up let's go pretty darn good oh look at that alright now how they wrap this I hope I don't know if the Spoils big enough they just take the corners and up to the tops yeah that's pretty much how you're going to get it but you know what we're going to eat this bad boy stand by this is going to be ugly I can't prepare with napkins this time this thing is huge big as my head I have to tell you this is no BS and this is every is every bit as good as the real thing like I said the key is using good ingredients and it got some good simple techniques and you can make one of these at home no problem anyway guys thanks again I'm getting a lot of requests for some killer burgers I'll be having another one coming up real soon take care
