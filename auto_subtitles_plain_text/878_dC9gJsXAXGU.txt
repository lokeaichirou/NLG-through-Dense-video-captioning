 hello this is chef john from food wishes comm and today we are doing roll your own sushi as promised do you made your sushi rice and now it's ready to roll some california rolls and you're going to need one of these this is a bamboo sushi mat very cheap you'll get that your local sushi supply store or the sushi department at walmart and once you get one of those you're going to wrap it in plastic wrap you also need for your fingers some ice water or cold water and some vinegar splash net it's just rice vinegar and that's going to make so the rice doesn't stick to your fingers are you going to need one of these nori seaweed sushi wrappers you're going to place that on your bamboo sushi mat shiny side down you're going to take a snowball sized handful of sushi rice I'm going to spread evenly over the entire surface now spread it before you start padding down you want it all evenly distributed and then you can lightly tap it down you just want it on there enough to stick because we're going to turn this over but you don't want to mash it down because we still have to form it and it will get too gummy so once that's set you're going to flip it over we're going to put down a couple pieces of avocado and I'm going to use a little bit of a fake crab salad the donations have been a little slow this week karma so anyway I'm going to use a fake crab with just a little touch of mayonnaise and salt and pepper and I'm going to put a nice little layer of that and not too much if you put too much you can't roll these so you're gonna have to do low experimenting but you see how much I have there not a ton and then you're going to kind of roll your mat up I'll do this real slow here and the top will fold right over and that crab and avocado will stay right in the middle and see how that works now let me pull this into the middle here a little bit so I could I basically finish the roll so once you roll it and you just got to be a little careful this when you start it but once it starts turning over then just push it down with your fingers don't press like with all your weight you just want enough see that to stick the rice together alright then you want to kind of make it into a round shape you can make into a square shape half circle the mat lets you kind of shape it any way you want and that's it now again be careful not to over press it you want the sushi rice still to kind of crumble when you eat it and if you press too hard it does get a little gummy and that's it we're going to take a wet sharp thin knife your sharpest blade you're going to cut right through that and look at that okay that's not bad for a Italian polish-russian chef cook now sometimes if you're you know you think you're good you can line up a few together and cut them like that I like to shake a little sesame seed on there some people put that in the rice or on the rice or in the roll and just shake it on top there's my soy sauce my pickled ginger and my decoratively scored wasabi Leung and that's it do yourself it's easy it's fun it's a hell of a lot cheaper karmic donations and I don't know how you say you can do it in Japanese but if I knew how I would say that so as promised there's your California sushi roll check the site for more details and as always enjoy you
