 all right here we go with our croak monster my favorite open-faced sandwich and I had that cheesy beige smell leftover so here's I'm going to do with it I'm going to take a leave on bread this is just a classic French country loaf of bread the round oval kind round oval I guess it's got to be one or the other I guess it's round so we're going to cut four nice big thick slices right out of the center so I'm not going to use the two end pieces all right now important since we're going to throw these in the oven they got to be the same thickness otherwise you know one's going to cook faster than the other so those are good 3/4 of an inch thick I'm going to drizzle about I don't know tablespoon olive oil on one side I'm going to flip them over all right so there's olive oil on the bottom I'm going to take my cheesy bechamel sauce now if you don't know where I got that or how that came to be you got to watch two clips on the site the bechamel clip and then the beginning of the cheese souffle clip where I added the cheese so it's basically a cheese infused I use creer a cheese infused time scented bechamel and I'm putting a nice thick coating on each of these slices so that's about a half a cup of bechamel I'm going to spread between four so if my math serves me correctly this was at an eighth of a cup all right now here's an important tip here go all the way to the edges of the bread because it's going to go in a hot oven and we don't want the edges to burn so if it's covered all the way to the edge with the bechamel you don't have to worry about that alright so make sure you get full coverage now what you top these with up to you I mean that's kinda obvious right but I'm going to use the traditional or one of the traditional combos here this is some nice smoky black forest ham I'm going to do maybe three or four thin slices per just like pizza you don't want too much topping if you get too much topping it's just it's too much less is more so a few slices of smoking ham is traditional all right on top of that I'm going to use a nice ripe tomato and if you can't find a ripe tomato don't even bother it don't put some pink mealy supermarket tomato on there so I'm going to put a couple slices on each all right and I didn't show it I want to save time I did a little salt and pepper on the tomato and then I'm going to top it with a couple tablespoons of grated melty cheese now what will work here any kind of Swiss cheddar I actually used fontina which is a nice one of my favorite cheese's I had some in the fridge so again you don't want so much that it just turns into a big giant glob of cheese so a couple tablespoons of cheese is plenty monetari Monterey Jack would work great here pepper jack all right if you can't eat cheese mean this is not the best not the best demo to be watching I'm sorry about that but if you do there's nothing better all right to top it off I'm going to take some hard grating cheese pecorino romano would work this is a Reggiano parmesan so just a just a little sprinkling this is going to help with the color it's also going to give it just a little extra layer of flavor so I put just maybe a half a teaspoon Reggiano on each and then just to finish this off a real light drizzling of the extra virgin olive oil maybe a half a teaspoon and those are ready for a hot oven so I bake these at 400 till they were done now how long did they take they took about 15-20 minutes all right but you got to check them what you want is beautiful golden brown on the top and the bottoms because we had a little olive oil on the pan the bottom is just crisped up a little bit so you know after 50 minutes check it look underneath but that's what it's supposed to look like when it's done and that is a beautiful beautiful open-faced sandwich again you cut into that there's a little creamy layer that time infused cheese bechamel underneath your ham your cheese your tomato these are great with asparagus I've seen it done with the broccoli I mean you can top it with anything but but it is a really nice lunch great picnic item and one last tip these are much better room temperature than they are hot out of the oven first of all you burn the heck out of your mouth and you just can't taste all the different flavor so let these cool down to room temperature just warm and and then I think he got something anyway give these a try and enjoy
