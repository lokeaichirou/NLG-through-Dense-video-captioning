 hi everybody and welcome back to cook and share today in this episode we're making up a world-famous dish that's commonly found in Thai eateries Pad Thai we were traveling the other day and came across this mobile restaurant that was serving it we bought something we thought boy hits this ever good so we thought we'd try and make it and share it with you I have to mention that there are many different ways of doing this and this is by no means authentic so if your Thai don't be offended so let's get started what I have here are some Thai noodles I just picked these up at my local grocery store you can also get them in any Asian store so we'll add these to a large container and pour a couple of cups of water over the top just enough to make sure the noodles are submerged and what you need to do is allow these to soak for about 30 minutes in the meantime what I'm going to do is begin preparing the sauce and the main ingredients for it are fish sauce chili sauce sugar and tamarind paste what I have here are some tamarind paste that I just picked up on my local Asian store now this is really a thick concentrated paste so what I did is added to a measuring cup put in some water and mushed it down and mixed it up and of course remove the seeds and if you want to know the exact measurements I did a write up on the blog so just check it out in making this dish is pretty important that you prepare everything in advance just so things go smoothly so what I have here is some shrimp that I've devayne dandy shelled some extra firm tofu that I've cubed up and fried some eggs chopped shallots some garlic some garlic chives bean sprouts and some roasted peanuts okay let's make the sauce first by adding the tammer into a preheated pan followed by the fish sauce the chilli sauce the sugar usually palm sugar is used in this recipe but if you're on the other side of the world like me white sugar will do just fine so we're just going to give this a stir over medium heat bring it to a boil and set it aside next what we're going to do is add some oil to a preheated pan add the shallots in followed by the chopped garlic and I'll stir and saute this just for a minute or two until they're fragrant then we'll place the shrimp in followed by the fried tofu and give it a stir until the shrimp become pinkish now we'll add in the Thai noodles that we soaked awhile ago some water and I'm just going to toss this until they're thoroughly mixed now we'll push everything to one side of the pan adding a little bit more oil just so it's not going to be dry crack the egg in so remember one egg is for one serving I'm just going to kind of break the yolk here scramble it up just a little bit and fold it into the noodles next what you're going to do is for the sauce over and stir it around until the sauce coats the noodles now I should mention here that everything is done over medium-high heat and of course you want to make sure everything is well coated and the noodles have absorbed the liquid lastly what we're going to do is add in the bean sprouts and the garlic chives and toss it for another minute or two until the noodles are saw dried and fairly tangled by the way this is a serving for one but if you're serving two or three or you're a big eater simply double or triple the recipe now we've plated this up we're going to garnish it with some roasted peanuts a few chives on the side some bean sprouts and lime wedges and there you have it our delicious Pad Thai a heavenly taste of Thailand so that was our pad thai I could eat this three times a week and I'm sure if you make this you'll say the same thing if you know of some other food icons from countries around the world drop us a line below and we'll try and make it and check out our website for many more easy recipes don't forget to click subscribe and like our videos thanks for watching and see you next time you
