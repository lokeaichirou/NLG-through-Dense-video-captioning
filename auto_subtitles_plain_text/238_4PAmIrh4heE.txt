 [Music] hi welcome to show me the CARICOM i'm Anuja and today we are making falafel now falafels do not need any introduction very simple recipe again very simple to make it at home so let's get started now falafels different countries or different regions have different recipes so this is the recipe that I thought I like the best so I'll be showing it to you so here I have taken 1 cup of garbanzo beans or your chickpeas oh you're so fit chana and I had soaked it overnight so one cup of China is approximately 200 grams so just to give you a rough idea I washed it and I soaked it overnight with lots of water and morning that's it I drain out the water it again gave it a rinse and with clean water and it's ready to use now the falafels do not you do not need to cook the channels you do not need to cook the prawns or beans so if you have a food processor over here and you need a food processor for this a blender is not going to cut it you're going to have a paste and you don't want that you want a little texture in your falafel so I'm going to just put chickpeas in here I have drained out all the water and I'm going to process it till it becomes like a breadcrumb kind of texture look at this just like bread crumbs I'm gonna put it into a bowl you can see the consistency beautiful look at it this is exactly how we want it I'm gonna keep it aside but the food processor back on and I'm gonna add in some garlic I'm using about 6 pieces of garlic against scale up scale down depending on your taste with the blade in there before I forget put it in that take a small red onion big pile instead and standards and small by us standards we'll just rough chop it because it is going to go into the food processor so why waste time I'm gonna give it a quick whirl once so gets a little head start and I'm now going to add in some herbs so I have over here some mint leaves ah absolutely divine again a little show-off moment from my garden so I'm gonna just use a handful and four mint leaves unlike cilantro leaves or coriander leaves you do not use the stem these stems are still a little tender because I've just plucked them make sure there's soft and just the best for you guys but usually they are a little tougher if you buy them from the store and I've washed it and I'm just going to use them so I'm going to take our old leaves this is a good handful I have a handful of parsley flat parsley over here again beautiful beautiful so I'm gonna chop them up roughly and it's gonna go in there the mint leaves are going to go in there and the equal amount of coriander leaves or cilantro leaves so again I'm gonna chop them up roughly and put them in there so let me get this started okay once everything is in turn it open scrape down the sides very important and one mobile there you go this place smells amazing look at this so I'm gonna take this back here now I'm going to combine this I cannot tell you now if you for all the people who like spicy food I didn't agree in chili along with your onion and your garlic and you're all set look at it looks so beautiful I'm gonna mix it absolutely fantastic I'm going to add some seasoning to it but one of the things I want to mention is that if you're going to be making it a little later I would suggest you add the salt last otherwise all those greens will let the moisture go and including the onions will let some moisture go and you'll have like us soggy mess and to this we're gonna add about noir one teaspoon of ground black pepper adjusted to your taste we're adding one teaspoon of cumin powder now if I was not using as much cilantro coriander I would add in some coriander powder but I think I've got plenty I'm not going to use that but if you cannot lay your hands on that fresh stuff of course that's the best just do this I'm going to also add in about two tablespoons of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of olive oil mix now this is really green and that's exactly how you want it so a little bit here or there as far as the herbs are concerned trust me it can only get better now falafels are inside are usually green and a lot of falafels use fava beans some of them use you know cooked chickpeas this is the recipe that worked really really well for me I add in one teaspoon of baking soda not baking powder I'm using baking soda directly because there is lemon juice in there it is going to activate it so I don't have to worry about half a teaspoon of kosher salt you can always adjust later once you taste it and I'm going to mix it now the salt and the baking soda needs to be added last or just before frying okay I'm gonna give it a little try here the salt is good but I need a little bit more lime juice so I'm gonna add just 1/2 more tablespoon and this point and we'll cover it and I'm going to put it in the fridge while I get the oil heated up so about 15-20 minutes maximum that's all I need so that way it will just set the the flavors and all will go into the crab and soybeans and it will be really easy to form balls also to make the falafel this has been about 15-20 minutes the oil is hot it's a reached approximately 350 degrees Fahrenheit 180 degrees centigrade you don't want it to get hot like black on the outside you want it to cook a little bit inside but not get dry so here you go I'm gonna give it another good mix so for some reason you know the greens are let the moisture go and it's become very watery but this is good like see if if your hands are like wet it's perfect but if for some reason you're not able to form the the falafel balls just a doughnut just a couple of tablespoons of all-purpose flour and you'll be fine but I like to make my falafels thin so that way they're crispy some people and some regions make it round and that's also fine I've actually used a paniyaram pan and made them because I didn't want to waste so much oil so that's always a good idea this is about the size I like to keep it flatten it out and and it doesn't need a whole lot of time it needs very little amount of time on both sides and as soon as you see it cut in the color changing a little bit and you're gonna flip it around you don't do not need to deep-fry this if you're making it flat and that's one of those other reasons why I like to make it flat that way I don't have to use up consumed so much oil perfect and this is done I'm gonna pull it to the side and I've got a paper plate with it with a towel on it got a mix put it on that and I'm gonna carry on and do the rest so the falafels are ready I'm gonna give it a shot if you open it up it's still so moist inside and the outside is crispy I know a lot of people a lot of your grumble that that you can hear me chewing so here's a great example about the outside being crispy and the inside being soft and moist and if you can hear it but it is absolutely amazing I just love it and this is how I like to serve it you have little pita pockets over here you can buy them from the store or you can if you have a video on it you can check it out just cut it up quarter them put a little falafel in there put a little bit of tahini sauce fabulous and come on you can do this
