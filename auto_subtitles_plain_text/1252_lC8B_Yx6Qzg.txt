 insite presents in the kitchen with Jennifer latet foodie brought to you by the great American Spice Company hi I'm Jennifer right you're fit booty I'm so excited to share with you today an amazing salad that's perfect for spring or summer it's called a fattoush salad also known as a Lebanese peasant salad so easy so fun to make starting out with just taking one cucumber chopped it up really small put it in your bowl then we have a yellow pepper you could use red or orange whatever flavor you like and then really pretty Tomatoes I like the blend of the yellow the red the orange a few green onions you can also use red onions if you prefer that for further red onions and then the most important ingredient for the salad portion itself is fresh herbs today we have a mixture of parsley and mint you always have to use mint to make it a fattoush salad but you can add in cilantro and some other herbs if you prefer to do that instead of the parsley and one of the little tips that I learned recently that I really like is how to cut herbs so they don't get too wilty on you so we have some really pretty mint today is really pretty parsley I'm just gonna grab them both together this is called a Sun Dial technique and you just chop up your herbs and then once you get a nice chop we're just gonna sundial so take your knife just like a sundial and go back and forth and it gives you that really nice chopped herb without getting wilty and that's great so mints is one of those herbs that can take a while to get used to so start out with a small amount of mint let your taste buds get used to it and soon enough you will find that you absolutely love the flavor of mint so we're gonna mix this around my at my parents my grandparents actually farmed fresh mint when I was young so I've always loved the smell of it and love working with it so I hope you do too so we've got our salad and now for the we're gonna take fresh lemon juice a lot of it and it's really healthy for a body it helps create an alkaline existence and a little bit of olive oil we're going to pour that in some fresh garlic has to be fresh it can't be the powdered a little salt and pepper and then our star ingredient is called fresh sumac is this brilliant it kind of reminds them you have like the Arizona clay colors this brilliant clay colored spice it's a dried berry from the Mediterranean they dry it down and they crush it into the spice called sumac it's really good for digestion and it's loaded down with antioxidants so it's really great for you it's known as a spice in the Mediterranean and Greece and Turkey and Lebanon it's not something that we use a lot around here but it's something that we should you can replace your table salt and pepper with sumac for some really great flavor and it has a little bit of a citrus zest to it so it also goes great with your vinaigrette so we're gonna mix all these things together and then we're going to pour the salad dressing actually half of it half of it gets poured over the salad you get messy have fun with it as part of fun is cooking with your hands smells delicious fresh lemon without sumac mixed in if you're a lemon person you will love this recipe so good with that fresh mint and then we're gonna throw in some pita chips so I have a whole wheat pita chip that you just toast in your oven you can also buy them in a bag too many places sell them and then once you throw in the pita chip you want to take the reserved dressing and pour over the pita chip itself so I think this may be why it's called a peasant salad they would use day-old bread and make it into the salad to create a little bit more substance with the salad itself so you want to allow the pita chips to kind of soaked in with this really yummy sumac vinaigrette and then from there we simply played it on a really pretty plate like this and I love white plates for summer with really fresh ingredients and we're gonna take a bite of this really yummy salad mmm it is so good and it is so fresh one of the things I'd like to point out about sumac is this is not a spice that you can buy at any grocery store the great American Spice Company is the place that you have to go to get it if you want to find the sumac so you can simply go to Great American spice calm and pick up this spice on line for a flat rate of shipping of just $5.99 so if you also want to get a really good salt and pepper using this recipe flat rate shipping all these spices for just $5.99 by going to the American spice com thank you so much enjoy your yummy Pitou salad I'm Jennifer right remember to exercise eat and enjoy for more information on today's recipe visit American spice calm and be sure to watch next week for another edition of in the kitchen with Jennifer the fit foodie
