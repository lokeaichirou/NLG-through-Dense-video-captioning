 hi everyone today I'm back with another drinking snack it's career mussels with scallion oil and peanuts in Vietnamese is Scott kimchi abnormal and this beautiful and delicious dish can be made in just 20 minutes can you believe that let's get started so I bought one pack of green shell New Zealand mussels it's one kilogram after cleaning the mussels I arranged them neatly on a baking pan live with aluminum foil then grease or brush some melted butter on each muscles as you about 3 tablespoon of butter which I melted in a microwave for about 15 seconds after that I put them into the oven for 10 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius next in a bowl a dissolve 3 tbsp oil sauce have a cup of water 1 tablespoon of sugar 1/2 a teaspoon of salt or a 2 TSP fish sauce and about a teaspoon of cornstarch or tapioca starch to make this off a little thicker stir well until everything well combined next in a pan or medium saucepan heat 3 tbsp of oil on medium high heat and add in about a cup of chopped spring onion and stir fry for about 15 seconds just cook very quick to maintain the green color of the spring onions then transfer to a bowl and save about a tablespoon of oil in the pan bring the pan back to the stove and add in the sauce mixture also I add in about a tablespoon up ginger would I have cut into strips and a teaspoon of garlic stir well and bring to a boil after that simmer on medium low heat until the sauce is slightly thickened so just cook the sauce for about 2 to 3 minutes and also add in some chili sauce to make it more spicy after ten minutes in the oven take the mussels out and reserve the sauce over each of them so when every muscles get some salt on it we're gonna put back into the oven and feel for another five minutes the muscles gonna absorb the sauce and become more tasty and juicy after five minute checkout and garnish each muscles with the spring onion know that we made some crushed peanuts and the fried shallots you can also use this recipe on scallops if you have fresh mussels it's gonna be to die for they look so so beautiful and delicious this dish can be a great appetizer or a perfect snack to drink beer with to serve just we're little ampules on each mussels is fresh light but complex it looks so impressive but it's so easy to make so I hope that you're gonna give it a try thank you for watching
