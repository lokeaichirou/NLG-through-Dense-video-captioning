 hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with make-ahead mascarpone mashed potatoes not only is this a delicious alternative to regular traditional mashed potato recipes but thanks to the casserole delivery system it's a very user friendly way to serve your potato side dish alright we're going to start by peeling about four pounds I have about four and a quarter pounds actually of russet potato I really suggest you use the russet I know a lot of people like mashed red potatoes but for me they're just too waxy the russet has the better texture for maximum butter absorption all right once they're peeled we're going to cut them in half I like to go lengthwise an old French chef taught me that a long time ago you take your time you make sure the knife is perfectly centered and you cut it down the middle that way and of course a key to this technique would be making sure you buy those extra large russet that are all basically the same size because we're going to cook these all the way through until completely tender we don't want small pieces falling apart and the bigger pieces stayin crunchy that would be bad we're going to boil those in salted water until like I said very very tender it's actually better to go a little tiny bit over then under undercooked potatoes we'll make those horrible lumps that everybody hates so just make sure they're totally tender so while those are cooking I'm going to go ahead and prep the rest of my ingredients which are a lot of butter that's right two sticks of unsalted butter see how nice and yellow that is that's really good butter and I know that seems like a lot but I have over four pounds of potatoes some restaurants use 25% butter by weight of potato so this is about half that all right it's a holiday meal I want a little decadence it's okay this is going to make like twelve servings alright so I'm going to cut the butter up in pieces just leave that out at room temperature and then for the rest I have our mascarpone cheese not a ton maybe about a half a cup one egg yolk and just regular milk so I'm going to mix that together now if I was smart I would have left my cheese out of room temperature because this was really hard to mix but I'm nothing if not persistent so after a couple minutes whisking it did mix in there nicely so you may want to just leave your mascarpone out on the table to come to room temperature so that's all combined and beautifully nice and frothy and then the last bit of prep here I have my seasonings salt black pepper and yes Cayenne so by then my potatoes were totally tender I tested them with a knife which went in quite easily all right they hadn't really fallen apart yet but they were definitely definitely very tender drain those extremely well let them sit there for like five minutes draining then I transferred into a large bowl I'm going to toss in my butter I'm going to toss in my salt and pepper and I'm gonna mash those with a regular wire potato masher if you want to put these to a ricer or a food mill or something go for it I don't think it's necessary I don't mind a few pieces of potato remember these are totally cooked and tender all right not all lumps are created equally undercooked potato lumps are evil a crime against nature but cooked potato pieces are okay those are going to just collapse when we serve this so no worries there once that's mashed I'm going to pour in my milk mascarpone mixture and as soon as that's all whip together I'm going to transfer this into my 9 by 13 standard casserole dish and then I'm going to smooth it out and I'm going to use the tip of the spatula to make little nooks and crannies and peaks and valleys and those are going to get nice and browned when we cook this and it's going to make it look awesome and rustic and delicious all right so that part is the make-ahead you can do that any time during the day you're going to serve it you could even do it the night before if you had to all right but that's going to take a little longer in the oven so I just made mine the same days I'm going to serve it it can sit right on the countertop until you're ready all right and when you are ready to bake simply pop it in a hot oven 425 for about 20 minutes or until it's heated through and golden brown if you want to cheat and put the broiler on the top for a minute go for it all right at you or make add mascarpone mashed potatoes so anyway there you go golden brown buttery delicious I should have waited for this to cool but I couldn't it was just so inviting look at that buttery crust look at those beautiful light mascarpone scented mashed potatoes inside just really really decadent not too rich just rich enough so yes it is basically a mashed potato but it almost has that aspect of like a potato pancake it's a little more satisfying it's just a nice little twist on the classic perfect for any special occasion so I hope you give that a try all the ingredients are on food whooshes calm of course and as always enjoy
