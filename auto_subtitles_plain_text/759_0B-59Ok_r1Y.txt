 when making holiday dinner there are a few essential size that you need on that table and one of them is a bowl of creamy mashed potatoes now if there's anybody showing you how to make mashed potatoes you want it to be this Irish guy now we don't want any lumps in these so I'm gonna show you how with a couple of easy steps we can make the perfect potatoes every time first off we need to choose the right potato for the job today I'm gonna go with the Yukon Gold because it has a buttery texture and it's perfect for mashing since these are for a holiday celebration we want them to be extra smooth and creamy so we're actually gonna peel these first before we start so I want to cut these potatoes into even slices economists say people make is that they cut the potatoes unevenly this is the number one reason for lumpy potato a good indicator to know how to take to cut them use the width of your finger and don't be afraid to compare each size to one another all right rolling I'm gonna add them to the pot last few here we're gonna fill it up with cold water and then we're gonna cook them off until they're fork-tender so we're gonna pop these on the stove put the lid on we're gonna bring them up to a boil for about 20 to 30 minutes all right so it looks like the potatoes are done so I'm just gonna turn off the heat we're just gonna drain them and when you can all that water off it looks good so now to ensure we get all of the lumps out of these bad boys we're gonna use a ricer so we're just going to spoon potatoes into the ricer 3/4 full push them right through like that oh that looks fantastic now using this riser it will ensure that we get that nice creamy texture that we want that's awesome look at that now I'm just gonna heat up my milk and butter and we're gonna add that to the potatoes cuz you really want that nice creamy texture that I was talking about earlier so we got them now good tip to remember is never add cold milk to your potatoes because it will affect the texture of them so we're gonna add in or hop back here with the butter look at that it's just coming together so nicely it's like a fluffy already so alright here's my secret ingredient some creme fraiche and that will give it some extra richness and creaminess now if you don't have any creme fraiche sour cream is a great substitute to [Music] season it up with some salt and pepper just combine that I'm now finally I'm gonna add in my choice look at that texture it's exactly how I wanted me to turn out okay I gotta taste these there is no holiday dish that these match players won't go back there after iterations [Music]
