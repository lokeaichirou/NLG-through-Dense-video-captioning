 today with a famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City and we're going to show you how to make the famous Waldorf salad join us and get the dish we'll show you the secrets behind signature recipes of famous eateries and how you can recreate them at home what makes this salad so special I mean where else in the world can you find a hotel that has a salad that we've been serving for almost a hundred years you know it has to have something special about it to us stood the test of time still be as popular today as it was 100 years ago originally invented in the late 1880s by hotel maitre d Oscar Turkey this dish and others were inspired by his desire to go above and beyond to please guests to this day turkeys legacy plays a role in the hotel from a namesake browser II Oscars to the widely known Waldorf salad every year since the hotel has served roughly 10,000 of these salads to famous guests from the Pope to President Obama we're in the kitchen of the historic Waldorf Astoria Hotel with executive chef David gar√ßa lon how does your version today stack up to the first version that was ever created biggest change probably from the original is that we don't use mayonnaise anymore we prefer to use yogurt and a little bit of creme fraiche to make it a bit lighter and a little bit more healthy a little bit more modern so the first thing we're gonna do is the candied walnuts you can do these ahead of time we new walnuts egg white a spice mix of some kind to give it to some flavor and some sugar we're going to start with our our walnut halves and we're gonna coat those with a little bit of egg white could you use pecans instead if you didn't have all that pecans pecans are great very good candy pecans are more sweet a bit of a richer flavor I would say with pecans so you don't need a lot of egg white it's really just there to make the sugar spice mixture stick to the walnuts we're gonna have the sugar add a little bit of spice mixture this one is hop Rica cayenne fennel seeds a little bit of coriander how spicy do you like to make it generally you know I wouldn't with a salad like this it's a really light refreshing salad I wouldn't make it too spicy then we'll spread those out on acheing sheet lined with parchment paper and again you want to make sure it's one even layer correct yeah you don't want them stuck too much together it's not the end of the world there you'll just have to break them apart of it so we're going to roast this in oven at about 350 degrees you really want to keep an eye on it so you just want the sugar to melt the walnuts continue to cook even after you've taken them out of the oven so be sure not to leave them in the oven for too long while the walnuts are cooking let's get started on the dressing David what do we need we're going to need some yogurt a little bit of creme fraiche some lemon juice white pepper walnut oil and black truffle we'll start with a little bit of creme fraiche you can use sour cream as a great substitute in the same amount or you could use just yogurt with a little bit of mayonnaise we work well also so a lot of it at our yogurt it's just whisk it together to combine it okay and I'm just gonna while you're doing that I'm just gonna squeeze in a little bit of lemon juice so a little bit of white pepper could you use black pepper instead absolutely good yeah so you're adding truffles chef's what does that bring to the dish I will swallow for story after all so it's a very elegant rare expensive ingredient so that's why we like to add it but it also brings a very earth aromatic flavor to that to the dish that's very unique it's all the black truffle and the entire building so the last thing we want to add is a little bit of walnut oil when we have this you want to whisk it fairly fairly quickly so I'll pour that in if you're anything like me you may not have walnut oil at home chef is there any other oil that we could use you can use hazelnut oil would work like another nut based oil you know truffle like a white truffle oil would work well if you don't have any of those just leave it out and it'll still be a beautiful salad so now we'll need to put the salad together chef's how do we begin with that so the ingredients we still need to add our celery roots granny smith apples Gala apples red grapes and microgreens okay so we want to julienne the celery root as well as the two types of apples we'd like to try the apple sure let's go for it let's watch your fingers chef what would you recommend if you don't have a mandolin at home you can use a sharp knife the most important thing is to get long thin slices so we've moved the apples into the mixing bowl what's next well let's pull the wall on side of the oven so the nice and golden brown you don't you really you want to keep it on the color you don't want that we get too much darker than this otherwise as you said they'll overcook now we're going to pour the dressing into the apples and celery is there a method to the madness here you want to make sure you don't put too much in or otherwise you're out to julienne more apples and celery it's important to coat the all the ingredients so to keep it from oxidizing you don't want them to turn brown that's what the lemon juice will do so the dressing actually helps prevent the apples from oxidizing that's it now we'll play the salad how necessary is that ring mold it's not really necessary at all but they say we with our eyes first so it's all about height presentation and color that's that's why we use the remote it's like the leaning tower of Apple crate so we'll just garnish the plate with some red grapes add a bit of color some of our walnuts and then these are microgreens you'd use the leaves the leaves from the celery as well really it's just for just for color and a little bit more height that's beautiful and there you have it a Waldorf salad from the Waldorf Astoria well chef all this talk is making me really hungry it looks delicious and I can't wait to try it I love the nuttiness of the walnut which are just sweet enough combined with the Crisp Apple texture it seems like something to be heavy but it is very light and refreshing it's great great first course for before your entree thank you so much chef David we'll see you next time when we get the dish on yum sugar TV you
