 [Music] hey everybody okay you ready have some fun we're gonna find with the name of this recipe because some people say general Tsao chicken some people say general tso chicken some people say general tso chicken so however so this is here however you want to say it I don't care I'm gonna say the American version because I did a lot of research most websites say Americans say it general tso chicken so I'm just gonna leave it at that right now you guys know what I'm talking about because everybody I've talked to says how much they love this dish so let's hope we can nail it all right come on close let's get started okay let's do the rundown of course you need the oil I'm using vegetable oil you've got the sugar right here some chicken broth white wine you can leave it out of the recipe if you want three pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast cornstarch soy sauce vinegar scallions or what some of you call green onions you know make this some garlic and some dried chilies all right the first thing I'm going to do is cube up all your chicken I did some some small ones and some really big ones kind of mix it up a little bit and then just set that off to the side now we're gonna work on our sauce that's right you may you could make this the day before and just put in the fridge and just shake it up and use it when you need it but right now we're gonna make it right here on the spot I think I've got everything laid out for the sauce so we're gonna start off with the liquids first we're gonna do the chicken broth we'll do the white wine will do the vinegar the soy sauce a little bit of water garlic this is the cornstarch sugar and then my favorite part right here close it up give it a shake well make sure make sure the lids on tight it's such a cooking with Jack shower incident okay before we start to coat our chicken over on the table put this on the table get ready to start doing the coating but first you want to get your oil hot so I'm gonna put some oil in the pan right now so we're gonna swirl slowly pour this in I'm only gonna go about half way maybe a little bit above the halfway mark okay you're gonna get this real hot you're gonna want to make sure that you only do a few pieces at a time seven or eight pieces at the most okay so I'm gonna let this heat up then we're gonna bring up bring over the chicken once it's dipped this is called a cornstarch slurry so we're gonna do is put all my cornstarch in here the recipe says is gonna look really bizarre it's gonna be very pasty as you guys know I don't make this stuff before I do the show so this could be a complete failure so we're gonna do an egg scrambled put your soy sauce in there and you're gonna mix up the slurry it's like flour it's gonna get really messy so just deal with it see it it's almost like caramel or something it's really weird all right let's put it in a piece of chicken and see how it works make sure your hands are clean by the way like really pasty okay so you dip your chicken in there it's gonna be gummy but when you pull it out there is gonna be some excess so let it drip I don't know why it's so gummy and yet when you lift it up it drips okay so you're gonna coat it like that once the excess is done take this over to the oil drop it in and cook it all completely on the outside and then put it on a plate with a paper towel all right so this is kind of what it looks like take a look once you got it all batter and you're cooking it looks just like that put it over here to drip dry we're almost done we're gonna go to the next step all right let the oil cool down a little bit then you're gonna dump out almost all of this and just leave a little bit at the bottom so we can stir fry the onions and the peppers okay so the next step is to take your peppers and onions get those stir-fried just about 30 45 seconds just to get everything poppin flavor-wise okay now get the sauce that we made earlier and it will have separated so you want to shake it back up see make sure there's no clumps in it you're gonna add the sauce into the pan and you're gonna cook this down until it thickens that's right it'll thicken just give it time okay so I'm sitting here stirring this and this thing just kicked in over time it was all liquidy like you just saw a second ago and then it went poof unbelievable look at it just completely transformed in seconds I'm totally blown away guys it like it just reacted I didn't even have time to turn the camera on to show you what happened but as I'm stirring the liquid it turned in this beautiful glaze it went poof and I had to stir it fast it was getting dark and it was moving around and groovin and whoo look at that Wow this is crazy look how thick it got okay so let's quickly put the pieces in we're gonna mix this all together see if I can do without okay so be ready for it to just take a fact I got caught off guard and this thing just launched into glazed heaven unbelievable I've never seen anything react so fast it was mind-blowing I wish I'd captured it on film can you even see that can you get a good I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the smells I am way excited okay I would say I nailed it that is gorgeous hold on a minute I'm gonna go cry I'll be right back okay can you tell him a little excited over this I mean so many times I like missed the mark on this show but when I hit it I impressed myself look it's completely coated the garlic is stuck like some man I just love it it's completely glazed I don't know what you guys think you saw it up close all right here we go mmm oh wow now what I say it was easy no this reminds me it was kind of difficult it was kind of like when I did Julia Child I did the the beef bourguignon and I'm kind of I'm kind of wondering if
