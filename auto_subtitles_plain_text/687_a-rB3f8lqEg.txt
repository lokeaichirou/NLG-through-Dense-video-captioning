 hi it's angel today I wanted to share with you my famous Chinese Mapo tofu dish now I'm calling it famous because every time I cook it I always get rave reviews and if you're a finicky mediator who doesn't normally like tofu well you might be pleasantly surprised because this dish is really hearty since we're cooking the sauce from scratch we can actually control the level of spiciness so we can make it super spicy or mild so with that let's get started first the ingredients start with one pound of lean ground beef you can also use ground pork or ground turkey but I really like ground beef in this dish one block of fresh soft tofu 2 to 3 stalks of green onions for garnish 1 small or medium sized yellow onion 3 to 5 garlic cloves and 2 and a quarter cups of chicken broth for our sauce base 2 tablespoons of soy sauce I'm using low-sodium but you can use regular as well two heaping tablespoons of black bean garlic sauce and for the spiciness we will be using 2 tablespoons of chili sauce feel free to use half as much if you prefer a milder sauce 1 tablespoon of cane sugar to balance out the spiciness and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce finally we'll need salt and pepper to taste next it's prep time cut the tofu into small bite-sized cubes like this about a half an inch per piece next dice your yellow onion into small chunky pieces since I'm using a medium size onion I'm only going to use half if you have a smaller onion feel free to use the whole piece next chop some green onions for garnish finely mince and peel your garlic cloves I've gone ahead to use a garlic mincer which helps give that nice even minced consistency next let's prep our thickening agent take the cornstarch and in a small bowl mix the cornstarch in with a bit of the chicken stock just make sure to mix completely so you have a smooth liquid now let's cook start by preheating your pan on a medium high heat and don't forget to turn your fan on once your pants been preheated go ahead and add about a tablespoon of oil to the pan you don't need much because there's already enough oils from the meat that we're going to be adding now go ahead and add your meat and stir and break it up into pieces in the pan once the meat is broken up into pieces go ahead and season with your sea salt and pepper to taste next to give the meat some flavor we're going to add our minced garlic after that I like to add half of the yellow onions reserving the other half for later the onions that we just added are for flavor while the ones at the end will be saved for crunchy texture next add two tablespoons or two splashes of your soy sauce then the black bean garlic sauce and also the chilli sauce next carefully add in your chicken stock and finally the cane sugar stur completely until well mixed then set aside to simmer for five minutes so now that I put the chicken broth in there I wanted to share with you guys a little bit of a secret so what I want to do is I'm letting it simmer for about five minutes the reason why I want to let it simmer is because I want that she can rock to reduce and it's going to have a really nice flavor after that reduction and the water kind of a baffle race trust me on this and since you never know if it's going to taste good I highly recommend you stop to taste pet after about five minutes it's time to thicken the sauce stir in the remaining yellow onions and then add in your corn starch just remember to give the corn starch mixture a good stir before adding it now quickly stir which will thicken our sauce once the sauce is thickened up a bit go ahead to gently add in our tofu once the tofu is mixed in you can go ahead and turn off the heat at this point as a final step mix in the green onions I hope you guys have a chance to try this recipe at home please let me know if you like it as much as I do and I will see you guys next time by smells so good already thanks for watching
