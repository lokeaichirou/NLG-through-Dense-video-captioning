 in this video I'm going to show you how to make it very very very simple five ingredient if you include salt and pepper hummus dip to my food processor I'm going to add a can of garbanzo beans or chickpeas next I'm gonna add a whole bowl of roasted garlic now all I did this is the green garlic that I got from my CSA so it's not as strong at least I don't think as regular garlic all I did is wrapped it in some tinfoil drew it in the oven cooked it for about an hour and then this doesn't dish as well as some of the other but what you can do with roasted garlic is you just squeeze it and it comes out as a paste you can see all that and this is a little different because it's not mature garlic I don't think it's strong so I'm actually going to use two bulbs of it now I'm going to salt and pepper it just to taste and add some olive oil I'm probably gonna end up adding more texture just keep letting and going to get the texture that you want probably gonna add a little bit more I'm add a little more olive oil but here's the texture that I'm working with right now taste it see if it needs anything else that's pretty good so that's it super simple right it makes a great great dip and here is the finished product you could add roasted bell peppers or really anything you like to your hummus but this is just a very simple roasted garlic recipe if you have any questions let me know otherwise I hope you enjoy Hey
