 hello and welcome to a thousand simple recipes today I'm in the kitchen making one of my favorite Mexican snacks the burrito and in this video I will do a bean version but you can be really creative with this and use some roasted or barbecued meats rice salads roasted peppers and onions and with a guacamole in a tomato cell so this is a really flavor some snack so without further ado let's make a Mexican burrito here's our ingredients for our burrito and I've got some guacamole here which I've done in another video so check the link and also I've done a tortilla or flatbread also check check that out in another link but you can buy those things in the supermarket if you don't have the time I've got some tomato paste some grated cheddar cheese some refried beans I've got some cocoa powder cumin powder some dried oregano some fresh mint lime juice I've got some red onion and some garlic I've got some chopped tomato some coriander and some fresh chilies and as always the recipe and the ingredients list is in the description box below so the first thing I'm going to do is make a tomato salsa and I'm just going to do up deseeded and basically all you do is just chop your tomato into quarters or eights and and just take the seeds out of them like that and then chop them finely now with our onion I've got a whole only that I've just chopped and I'm just going to add those to the salsa and I've got some four or five mint leaves and I think mint goes really well with this tomato salsa and so I'm just gonna slice that up and we'll just roughly slice that up it doesn't have to be too small and I'll just add that to the salsa and all that my bet half a bunch of coriander a pinch of dried oregano half a teaspoon of salt and I'm just got a yellow habanero chili this is optional of course if you like it hot I'm just going to slice that up finely and put that in as well and of course I've got one lime that I've just juiced and we're just going to pull that through and we'll mix that up and what you can do is put this into a fridge for an hour while you re fry the beans and the longer it sits there the more those flavors will really come together really nicely and it'll be an absolutely delicious tomato salsa so I'm just going to cover that I'll put some of that yellow chili in and that's it for our tomato salsa and onto our refried beans so doing our refried beans which I've just got about two or three tablespoons of olive oil and then I'm just going to throw in one dried red chili now this is optional of course I'm just going to let that fry up and I'm going to throw in about a quarter of a teaspoon of dried or Agana some garlic about close and a half to two cloves of garlic just gonna fry all those up and then we will throw in our half a red onion that I've chopped finely with the onions I just want a little bit of color into the onions I don't want to cook them too much but I just want them to get a little bit of color that's just starting to color now and that's been on for about two two-and-a-half minutes and now I'm just gonna add my coat that 1/2 teaspoon each of Coco and cumin powder and that's gonna give it a nice these beans the refried beans a really nice rich taste and we're just gonna fry those up for a few seconds and I'm just going to throw in a tablespoon of tomato paste now I'm just going to fry put that to one side and fly that to get the tartness out of the tomatoes and that that Sun maybe probably 15 seconds I'll fire that up for and then add it to the rest of the mix it through the onions and the spices so with basically what we're trying to do is just build layers into the refried beans so that's about enough and I'm just going to mix those all through now and when we deseeded the tomatoes for our tomato salsa I we're just going to use all those deseeded tomorrows and we're gonna add that I'll just cook that up for a few minutes and I'm just gonna add about 1 TSP of sugar just to balance out that acidity in the tomatoes and we'll just fry that up for a few minutes and then we'll add our refried beans so this has been on for about three or four minutes and I'm now going to add my refried beans I've got probably one can the other thing I'm going to add is just about a quarter of a teaspoon of salt to the mix and we just cook those up for a few minutes and I'm just going to mash probably half of them like this and the rest will leave the way they are hold and this has been on for about oh ten minutes and I'm just going to turn the heat off there and we'll wrap up our burritos now I've got my fresh tortilla that I've just made but if you're using one from a supermarket or a shop just give it a quick blast of heat either in the microwave or 15 seconds on a hot pan on either side just to loosen up so it's easy to roll now the first thing I'm gonna do is put some cheese down across my burrito because I'm also once we've rolled our burrito I'm going to put it on a fry pan and quickly fry it so this cheese will melt once it hits the heat so you want it close to the bread and I'll just put that into the onto the fry pan so and that will also help the flatbread hold together when you're reading it so now I've just browned this on each side for fifteen or twenty seconds and now it's ready to eat so here we have our Mexican burrito and I can't wait to take a bite out of this and hmm I tell you with a salsa the melted cheese and the refried beans that is a great combo so that's all I have for you this week so you'll have to come back and see me next week on a thousand simple
