 I've got some chicken wings there guys this one hmm you're going to love it we're doing a deep-fried chicken wings with a nice little batter we're gonna season this top little season it up late marinades all kind of the things Christian Caribbean part that come always a pleasure to have you guys here in the kitchen with me today we're doing my take on something that our youngest daughter Indy she enjoyed at maracas be in Trinidad she's nothing to the big and sharp thing who knows maybe she doesn't like to see sharks get injured I don't know man but big guns not good for this today we're doing the chicken wings that we purchased for her it came with some french fries and some garlic sauce Caribbean people love the garlic sauce I have some links down at Caribbean pot that come for that check that out but today we do in the Caribbean style deep-fried chicken wing so here we these chicken wings were washed with some fresh lemon juice i drained it and if you will notice I also put up the sort of tips off there go through it make sure there's no feathers the last thing you want to do is give people chicken wings or feathers I'm going to go with some salt Caribbean green seasoning and I'll have a link for that in the description of the video click on there you'll get it a little bit of acid with some ketchup some oyster sauce black pepper and we're going to go in with a little dash of curry powder give that a good mix so it's all mixed up it's just a matter of giving it time to marinate now if you got some onion powder I would go in with us maybe about a quarter teaspoon of onion powder and there as well see if a garlic powder if you want to go with a little bit of garlic powder you can do that let this marinate for a couple hours and then we're going to get to dusting them and fine I've got some cornstarch in a ziploc bag here some fresh ground black pepper a bit more salt and all-purpose flour put that in there tie it up and shake that around this is what we're going to use for dusting those wings before we fry them up I've got about four cups of vegetable oil coming up to temperature there and as that comes up to temperature over here what I'm going to do is I've got two eggs in a bowl and that's not typically will stop just to break that up then I'm going to pour it all over my seasoned chicken which has been marinating and you want to toss that around in there you want that egg to cover all as much as you can off the chicken pieces because that's what's going to help that sort of dredging that what I'm doing the flour combination our seasoned flour stick to the chicken wings so my oil is up to temperature now you'll notice that I'm using a very wide wok here simply because when I put the chicken pieces in there it's not going to splatter all over the stove on the kitchen floor and counter and stuff like that between me and you can dizzy yell at me sometimes for that as make mess anyways French jokes though so what I've done is I've gone ahead and I've dusted some of these wings in that lovely dredge that we made and you don't want to crowd the pan too much because the last thing you want is the oil dropping and temperature basically all you do is grab a chicken wing shake off as much as you can into the bag probably do about four or five of them at a time in there just showing you guys seal it up and then gently shake it up in there just to coat the entire chicken with its lovely seasoned drugs they've been going now for about 1213 minutes I've been tossing them so flipping them over from time to time I'm looking for a nice crispy skin they're fully cooked on the inside now because of the high temperature was frying that but I'm just going to give it a few more minutes to in total anywhere from about 15 to 18 minutes depending again on the size of your chicken wings and we use that cornstarch to help get that crispy skin on the outside chicken wings all dressed up and ready boy is fat tonight that lovely sort of dip that I made as well I'll have a link for that for you guys these chicken wings are amazing your boy already went in and tested a few of them 15 minutes or so in that friend and that hot oil flip them over nice golden color take them out let them drain I'll show you guys what I have here if it's a while rock on a cookie sheet and s let them drain off so you can see all that oil that I got there one more peek at those chicken wings Chrissy a career in pod comm hope you guys give this recipe a try remember to click Subscribe all the latest videos are going to be sent to you click through to Carribean pot that comfort this and over 300 other Caribbean inspired and most of them traditional as well recipes have a good one days
