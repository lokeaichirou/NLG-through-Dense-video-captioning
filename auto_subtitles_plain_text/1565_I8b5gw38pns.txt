 hi guys we're going to have some fun today because we'll be making clam chowder take a look gorgeous it has everything in it has the corn bacon it has celery just everything cream base clam chowder you're watching the bear pantry show the first thing we do that you're going to need of course are going to be clams and you can use the stuff that's in the can like this but I don't want to do that I want to make it from fresh clams so I went to the store and I bought four pounds right here it's about eight something for four pounds and we're going to need a piece of cheesecloth or if you don't have this use paper towel we're going to need a brush and I stiff brush to clean it with and I bought a new one because I don't know what the kids use my brush to clean in the kitchen okay because I got some brushes in here that I tell them it's only for fruits and vegetables but I don't know what they do with it so I bought a new one so now let me dump the sound in the bowl so here there are it's quite a few and the first thing that you need to know is they need to just smell like the salty ocean if they smell kind of funky like fish going bad don't buy them okay so I had Joe sniff a motor in the stores your cell so we're going to pour some cold water on this and let it sit for about a half hour alright so this is my second roll around and just brushing it literally well what you know that clam chowder is not hard at all to make but it's one of those recipes that's going to take a lot of little steps all right so you just going to have to have some patience but in the end it's going to be so worth it let's start off first of all with what we're going to need so of course we start off with clams and we're also going to be needing some potatoes I have a huge onion hair if you have small and ends uses small M use two small ones we're going to need all purpose flour butter of course you see celery bacon strips I have four pieces of bacon heavy whipping cream this is not half and half and some kernel corn in the can and you can delete any of these things that you don't like alright so we're going to start off first of all by cutting the bacon into bite-sized pieces because we want to prepare this to get it cooked in a skillet or right we're going to also put the celery in bite-sized pieces I happen to personally not like celery so I'm not going to use a whole lot of it but you can put more according to your taste and we're also going to dice up the onion and look I dice up kind of funny I just going to peel the onion and go on both sides and then I kind of turn it on its side and cut my little dices that's just the easiest way I've ever you know tried doing onions and I don't cry when I cut onions I don't know what's wrong with me cuz you know i think you should be crying when you cut onions and I've peeled the potatoes and washed and clean and I'm going to dice them into bite-size pieces right here because we wanted to go into the soup you know in bite-size pieces that you can serve so I start off by putting the bacon in a hot skillet and we're just going to cook this on low and just allow this to cook until it's really really crispy all right meanwhile I have a soup pot going to the halfway mark with some water and I want it to boil a little bit hotter than this before actually drop the clams in there right and look at my stuff that's waiting for me my onions celery and potatoes now all that stuff to do is to check on our bacon so this is good I so let's get this from the pan alright so I'm going to put them in with this hot spoon okay because I don't want to get burned by this hot water so that's two three ten got quite a bit now the reason that we're putting it in this hot water to boil is because that's going to open them up and also we're going to be making our clam juice for the other part of our sewer supine it's time to remove the clamps from the water I've shut off the stove already and they open up nicely for me they took about eight minutes you don't want to cook them too long okay because if the clams get overcooked they get kind of rubbery and I'm removing them with this skimmer look one escape from the shell you know what the shells look kind of pretty they look like you can make a jewelry box or something out of them so Joe I had asked me when I started making the video how we're going to get the clams open and I told the hot water will open them so look at that huh so I'm using the water that the clams were boiled in to make the clam juice and i'm using a ladle to just dip the water out of the pot and put it through this cheese clock if you don't have cheesecloth use a piece of paper towel reason I'm doing that is because I don't want any sand if any escape off of the shells you know if it escaped it would settle on the bottom of the pot I don't want any of that to get in my juice so now I'm over to my skillet I didn't put any butter in here just a nonstick skillet and I've put in the onion and I'm putting in the celery and basically I'm just going to stir this for a little while to make them get kind of brown and you don't need any butter if you're using nonstick okay so now it's time to add our clam juice and I'm going to be using all of this four cups of clam juice and if you're using clams from the can you would go ahead and put water to the juice that's in the clam and I put in the potatoes of course and you want them to cook until the potatoes are tender so here are the clams I got them from the shell was using a knife at first to cut him up but it wasn't working so good so i use my shears and now i'm adding three fourths cup of butter i didn't tell you at the beginning how much butter but it's three quarter cups of butter to my big pot I wash my pot that i boiled the clams in and i'm just going to allow it to melt and this is almost done the potatoes the seller and onions almost and you'll know it's done when the potatoes are tender and to this butter after its melted we're going to add our flour because we're making a room so adding in the flour a little bit at a time and we're going to whisk you want to move quickly at this part okay because you don't want it to lump up on you and of course if it does put it through a strainer I'm going to use this whole chord of heavy cream and if you're watching your figure and stuff use half heavy cream and half milk but i'm using the whole thing because i want the chowder to look like chowder nothing upsets me more than when i get some type of chowder and it's kind of soupy and thin and not fake so just remember that you don't want to eat this too often okay if you're watching your cholesterol and stuff like that so I'm just whisking to make sure that there are no lumps in my beautiful base right here and now I'm spooning in the potatoes and the celery and stuff from the other skillet we're going to use everything okay even the water but the reason I'm spooning it in this is because I don't want to pour it too quickly and it splatters and then I get burned that's the main thing that I try not to get burnt or cut what I'm in the kitchen so now it's time to add our clams and they're all diced up in small pieces doesn't look like a lot but it does go a long way in in this to you and I'm just going to stir and watch it I have it on medium heat and oh by the way I forgot to tell you guys I'm going to add my kernel corn right here and you don't have to put the corn if you don't want to and even when it comes to the bacon you can just save the bacon and put it on top when you serve a bowl of this the clams the clam chowder so put it in you don't want this to go for more than five minutes this is going to reduce down reason why you're watching it so closest because you don't want the clams to get rubbery like i said before okay so it's going to reduce down and i'll take a look thick beautiful gorgeous smells good piping hot now it's just ready for a bowl or ready for a bread bowl awesome huh check it out guys see beautiful nice and thick isn't it no you guys want some of this try this all right it's not too hard whew eps but not too hard so this was awesome you guys I can't wait for jay to the invite calling that come over call it come on over come get your clam chowder and I'm so happy to eat this because when I go to restaurants I never eat the soup because always has a machine so I never ate the soup so this I can mean till the cows come home but i'm not going to overdo because you remember we use a lot of heavy cream all right but here's my mole i want to taste and of course you guys know okay before I taste let me tell you guys you don't have to put the kernel corn you won't have to put the celery I don't like celery and stuff I only put it in here because I wanted to show you a more traditional clam chowder but you'll definitely don't have to put the things that you don't like all right when it comes to the bacon you can also garnish the top of the big in but I like putting it inside because to me it just tastes better to get some pieces in there and also like i said before i got jada sneaking up on me trying to get my clam chowder guys like i said before you can happen half the the middle can be myself when we look at this to look at you could like do have heavy cream half milk so it's not so rich and heavy all right but I mean how often are you going to be eating this all right so reversed I'm gonna want to cooked it but I have to check it finish poison so all of a sudden you have to make sure you protect mommy yeah okay oh if I fall did it song it's too good for dinner bacon bacon bacon bacon rude I got a bit of the corn that tastes so good the sweet against the briny taste of the clams and again guys forgive me if I've been seeing oysters because I don't know what I've been saying the whole show i hope i've been saying clams but i don't see it till that final edit how is regina anyone's the soul clams kinda remind me of comes no the abalone so i suppose we could make another one like this in the future we will call it comes chowder instead of com soup you know how belize and have comes up through the clam so good mmm I got corn I got clams bacon I got potato and I got bacon in that bite that I took just know it's so chunky and beautiful and like I said at the end of the video I'm gonna put one in a bread bowl will see you guys can get a look at that ok so you can serve it in a bowl you can eat this with crackers you can eat it with Bridget and eat it alone it's definitely hardly so you can get your belly full off of this and I've had fun doing this I really have had fun doing this joy helping with a lot of it he video tape and he helped me cook up some of the stuff as I was like
