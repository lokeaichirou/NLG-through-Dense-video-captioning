 then Wednesday's breakfast come from Island oh and while the plan cakes made from potato potatoes so explain more about this this is an Irish potato cake okay we're going to make our very own using potato flour and chive again we can use that to sandwich between roasted tomatoes black pudding and some streaky bacon it was an awesome brunch dish we can make easy-peasy no trouble at all stop the potato so a couple of large potatoes just peeled quartered put into cold salted water you have brought up the ball for about 15 minutes or so okay I knew in that with that okay so there we go we just jump that step just drain those potatoes and then pop them back into our pan yeah and now a quick mash okay so we just want a completely dry mash the potatoes no added butter or milk or anything like that so we just season the potatoes off at this point plenty of salt and pepper so this Republic of Ireland or Northern ID uh well I was here ago island in s good day hotel I worked at there for a year and they used to use these all the time hey you can buy them pre-made you can even buy them in supermarkets yeah you see how simple they are I can actually make them home no job at all so I just take some chives give those a quick slice it up and then if your potato is well mash which i think is we'll get rid of our masher and add in our flour okay so this is like potato bread really I suppose you're going to roll out I'm going to cook it and use it to sandwich two things together yeah so they often either use them fried with a brunch or with breakfast once you got all that flour combined I'm gonna put the chives in when I put your hands in there get some the potato we're gonna start molding this it is gonna be quite hot but well you know I have one cans a good dusting of flour on our board then we take what is now this kind of mashed potato bread almost dough because the flour we put it yeah and we'll put enough just to make the base of our frying pan okay so we want all right that kinda you can just kind of pack out to a nice circle yeah that's fairly thick keep it nice and round as you go and kind of level all over then I'm going to put a glug of oil into our frying pan and all we now need to do is fry this off okay so nice and thin all over just is similar to yaki really similar and since it's mashed potatoes then sort of thickened with flour yeah a difference being it's not enriched with egg or Chee anything like that and we're going to fry it instead of point it all right so this stage we'll take our potato fold okay nice flowery bottom nice and round that's going to go in here take your file it's and then they call it above and beyond potato pancake we came to a farm yeah I can see how that works so again we just fry on that side for a couple of minutes then we'll turn over and do the same we Ella mm-hmm while we're waiting for that to do we'll make our middle okay what we're going to sandwich in between so some streaky bacon you can just lay a couple of those out you can do and I've got some black pudding here which all I'm going to do is take off the kind of plasticky membrane cool can we explain a bit more about black pudding because as soon as it seems to get a bit of a bad about it it's an awesome awesome pork based product that uses pig blood so that's why people are very concerned by you know they know it's got blood in it but it's just a really good kind of sausage blood sausage well worth a try if you haven't already tried it black pudding making sure they come from the same animal that's exactly the same edible yes so basically strips going to come from the back of the bat back of the pig down there right and this is a whole number of variety different bits of pig but within the blood to find it okay without sources other things so if you're happy to eat bacon give that pudding go okay well the bacon black pudding small so Grill under there we can actually flip our potato fault over well hey Matt she got a nice kind of crispy bottom that is another couple minutes on the other side what's under the grill needs couple minutes as well to finish cooking through and then we can show you how to pile up our breakfast brunch Jamie if you can grab our grilled stuff out have a little look at our potato file which we can just slide out on to that table there and then cut them into quarters traditionally I don't know why but Ted files always serve in triangles now what we need is something to plate it up on I'm sorry someone to plate it up on this is definitely a leprechauns stool no it's not as nice as the one being generalistic it's nice chopping board all we're gonna do is place our potato file on the bottom there layer up everything in the middle so some strips of bacon bit of black pudding some fresh roasted tomatoes and then our other one on top you see we've got plenty more to make another one on top of the loads and loads and loads going on so there we go it's our Irish potato cake breakfast sorted and I think it needs a good splodge of sorts as well so dig into that I'm Jed Woodley looking forward to this hmm honestly I am NOT on my Nelly did I think it would taste as good potato black pudding now that an Irish Breakfast I would definitely have this for the west my life if I could you have been whipped me cause that is good hmm lots of people don't we don't have any girls that's because this is definitely a void zone enough with the Irish musicians already
