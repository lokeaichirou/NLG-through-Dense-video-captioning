it's so good place that buttermilk into a large bowl I like my ball with a brining bag okay now we're gonna add in some good ol hot sauce I'm using Franks because it's the hunk home good but you can use any kind you want to okay and then you're gonna add in some onions you're gonna throw in a little bit of garlic and you can also throw in some salt if you want to that's you know I look flavor to whatever but yeah go ahead and mix that up okay get it well combined and then we're gonna take our little chicken here just one whole cut up chicken fully thawed out we don't want you to throw the Chi and just place it right into this brine just like this right here that's perfect go ahead and push it down just like that dunk it in there you're gonna take this a bag and wrap it up you want this chicken to be completely submerged in this Brian all right perfect we're gonna brine it for three hours or so and then when it's done pour off that brine and then shake off the excess brine from the chicken I didn't even rinse them off I just went ahead and shook it really really good and got as much buttermilk off as possible and now it's time to move on to our spices I have a ton of different yummy spices in here it's gonna mix this all up until it is a world combined okay anything we're gonna season up my chicken generously with this spice mixture front and back don't use Oliver using you

plane if you want to listen man just make sure you get it you know well seasoned it like that YUM looks perfect all right now I have some self-rising all-purpose flour here perfect for frying chicken
