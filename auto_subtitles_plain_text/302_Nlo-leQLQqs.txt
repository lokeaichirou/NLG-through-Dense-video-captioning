 today I'm going to show you how to make perfect miso soup now miso soup for Japanese is a comfort food we eat this at least once a day and depending on which season it is or which region it's made we have many many different kind of miso soup for example you know you know summertime we put summer vegetables and wintertime we put something like daikon radish and me so if it's in Kyoto we use white miso and if it's IT Perfector we use red missile so there's not just one type of miso soup but today I'm going to show you some basic miso soup today I'm going to use daikon radish become a seaweed tofu scallion and this is combined miso so it's not really white no red it's kind of like our in-between and this is dashi it's some stock made from kombu kelp bonito flake so let's start now first of all you're going to put dashi into the pot and turn on the heat now when it comes to me so you do not want to boil missile the reason is it's a fermented food and you had so many microorganism living inside so if you boil this the harsh heat will destroy the flavor and it just doesn't taste good so whatever you need to boil you need to boil before adding miso so today there's only one thing that I need to boil which is daikon radish so I'm going to cook this in in the - eat like this and I let it cook so the daikon radish is cooked already now we can start adding tofu and welcome a seaweed we've got we're going to put the scallion at the very end before serving and now we're going to put miso now before we add me so you want to turn off the heat so that it doesn't boil over and pour one cup of dashi stock we're going to use one tablespoon of missile but this is all depends on what type of mister you're using because some miso is more saltier than the other so make sure you taste as you go for example if you have three cups of dashi put 2 tbsp first and then taste and if you need some more then add one more ok so this is how you do this you don't have to have this one you just need a regular strainer and let go so all you do is just mix this and make sure everything is dissolved think so it's all dissolved there we go and then you're going to turn on the heat again but this time you're just warming this up not boiling it so this is already a good temperature and it's ready to be served now you're going to turn off the heat and just scoop then I prefer putting scallion right before serving like so and it's ready to be served you
