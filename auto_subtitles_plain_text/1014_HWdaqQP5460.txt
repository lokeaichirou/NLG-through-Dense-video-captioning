 today on how - we are making cow food or crab fried rice Fatiha welcome to hot tile kitchen today we're making something very simple and super delicious we're making Khao pad or fried rice which is one of those staple lunch items in Thailand now Kao means rice and Pat means to stir-fry so it's a very simple translation there but specifically we are making cow poo or crab fried rice which is one of my favourite and most popular variation but you can do Khao pad move with pork how about guide with chicken or help it go with shrimp so it's completely up to you so let's get started let's talk about rice because it's the most important thing and this dish I have here one and a half cup of cooked white rice pack it down when you measure it by weight it's about nine and a half ounces now I'm using here jasmine rice which is the one that we normally aged in Thailand and it's important to use jasmine rice because it actually has a unique fragrance even when it's raw when you open a bag of jasmine rice there's that beautiful floral smell that you can that's unique from other kinds of rice the most important thing about rice with fried rice is that it cannot be too mushy over cooked too much water in it because you will then get mushy fried rice so the rice has to be cooked through but the grains maintain integrity it shouldn't be it shouldn't look like it's bursted or the edges are starting to kind of get a little bit soft and I cook this rice yesterday it's actually better to do fried rice we're not better but easier to do fried rice with cold rice because the grains separate more easily we don't tend to clump up as much short grain rice will not work for this because they tend to be a little sticky and longer super long green like basmati rice is not quite as fluffy so jasmine rice is perfect for this so there we've got that other than that there's not a whole lot of prep to do we've got three to four cloves of garlic already chopped and we've got one green onion cut into rounds now if you've got if you've got a green onion that's really fat in the white part make sure you're running knife horizontally across this way otherwise you get big chunks of green onion in your mouth and that's not fun and then seasoning every Thai cook has their own version of salting agent for fried rice ever most people agree on soy sauce but I've seen every combination out there with fish sauce oyster sauce salt golden mountain sauce so I'm giving you my version which isn't to say that it's the correct one or anything it's just the one that I like best so I've got 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of fish sauce ok now let's talk about soy sauce a little bit this is a recipe where if you can get your hand on Thai soy sauce it will actually make a difference not all soy sauces are created equal Thai Chinese Japanese soy sauce is all differ in flavor and color Thai version is lighter in both color and flavor and in my opinion and I'm a little bit biased it's a little bit more fragrant and we call this EU cow or literally white soy sauce even though it's not white but it's named to contrast see you dumb or black soy sauce which is a thicker darker sweeter version so if you can't find this I'm using healthy boyfriend you can use any sort of soy sauce all right so that's that for seasoning other than that I've got three ounces or about 85 grams of Dungeness crap you can use frozen or canned or whatever this is fresh or any other type of protein if you're using raw protein like chicken or pork I like to marinate it a little bit with soy sauce so it has some flavor and we've got one egg some white pepper and half teaspoon of sugar and that's pretty much it let's go to the stove so I've got here a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil in a non-stick pan if you got a a wok right I don't well not one that would work with this though anyway um so once the oil is hot you can add in some garlic okay now if you're using raw protein which were not today but if you are using raw protein once the garlic starts to turn a little bit Brown the smallest bit starts turn brown that's when you want to add your raw protein cook it to 60% then add your a hey but we're using cooks protein so we're going to add that with the rice so the smallest bit of garlic has oops turn brown we're going to break the yolk let it set for a little bit don't scramble it right away and when it set a little bit scramble gently now you want to scramble it gently and not right away because otherwise your egg just turns into complete mush you're still going to want pieces okay now that you've got X on what set you're going to go in with the rice break it down a little bit keep cold rice break down easier with the crab break it down give it a quick toss then you're going to go in with the seasonings they're soft and soy sauce already in here have a seat spoon of sugar a little bit of sweetness just cut the salt couple of dash of white pepper for some heat and now you're just going to cook it until all the rice is heat up and the sauce has been thoroughly distributed now I'm using cold rice but if you have hot rice it doesn't mean that you can't use it in restaurants we use hot rice all the time because now there's no sense keeping a whole other set of cool rice it just becomes a little bit harder you need more attention and breaking it apart let it sit for a little bit to the store so I've got on medium-high heat final boss and then that's pretty much done if you if you're not sure if it's done you can just feel it with your finger to see if it's hot give all the rice isn't hot and if it is go into the green onion you want to add cilantro to this go for it and that's it that's done let's go over there and put so this feeds me twice but it's for big growing boy it's probably more like one large portion that now it's not over you want to serve this always with a Weddington I'm okay and I'll I'm going to cut line we tell it like this we don't cut moon wedges it's actually easier to grip in space like that there goes lime some cucumber and it's the cucumbers a nice palate cleanser actually this is kind of heavy so I'm using a julienne peeler just great for papaya salad just do a couple of peels decorative leash you don't have to do this of course I'm just trying to make it nice a couple of slices right here and then I'm going to show you how I like to eat this squeeze a lime all over and the acid in the lime really cuts the salt and the the oil and makes this that much more delicious some chili powder or pick four for some heat and my favorite condiment prick numb flat now I've got a whole video on Thai condiment so you can go and check those out if you like but this is a mixture of Thai chilies fish sauce and or some lime chopped garlic whatever a little bit extra and mix everything up together and we're ready to eat so I'm going to go and eat now thanks for tuning in and for the written recipe please
