 when I tell you that making perfect hashbrowns is easy I mean it there is only one ingredient but there is one rule and that rule is it takes 30 minutes to make hashbrowns and I mean it 30 minutes if you don't have 30 minutes make toast I'm going to show you how easy it is to make crispy on the outside moist on the inside hashbrowns every time and we're going to start by peeling a potato now I'm going to peel this is a russet potato or a baking potato and this is the potato of choice for hashbrowns but I have made them with Yukon Gold and red potatoes whatever sometimes whenever I have on hand and I've had just as much luck with that too but these stretchy ones are the ones that are usually recommended so one russet potato okay now that looks pretty good okay there's my peeled potato and now we're gonna do is grate the potato and this is the perfect size right here what this I don't know what this is called but that size a hole on the grater is perfect because if you use a hole too small you'll get mushy potatoes if it's too big they won't cook so this is the perfect size so you just grate it it takes maybe a minute to grate one big russet like this okay so we're getting close to the end here and of course you have to be careful I don't mind wasting a little bit of potato but I try to throw away the last little bit so that I don't cut my fingers so there it is it's one grated potato and this is how much look at how much you get from one one russet potato like that that should be enough just for me you think I'm kidding I love hashbrowns okay now this is an important step we're gonna get the moisture out of this these potato this potato but and as we're doing that we're going to preheat the pan because I have but you get you get your the biggest pan you have this is my big big huge pan preheat it to about medium-high and I'm gonna put in like about a teaspoon of olive oil okay that's it no need to use butter heart-healthy olive oil now this is the fun part and the important part we're gonna take this the potatoes and we're gonna get as much moisture out as possible and it might take more than one time okay so I have four ply of paper towels here and so I just kind of spread them out like that and I roll them up and you just squeeze out the moisture you can see it's already on the cloth like that and there's quite a bit in here so if you get this much moisture in the paper towel we're gonna do it again so I will put another towel down here I know it's it's messy but it does take some commitment it's really important to get all the moisture out so this potato is requiring to Rowling's like that so you just spread it out so it gets touches as much of the paper you know what I'll do I'm gonna take even extra paper towels go like this on top and then roll it and that should do it that should do it squeeze it and there's no more there's very little moisture coming out to the towel story about my mess look at this and then I put them in a bowl just so I can kind of fluff them up a little bit and gives me a place to kind of add the salt and pepper so that's it you just kind of brush it off the paper okay now and I can pick up okay so there there it is it's nice and dry this it's not very wet at all and all you do is just add a little salt and pepper to taste it doesn't take much because you can always add salt later but don't put too much in so I'll put a little bit of salt in and a little bit of pepper and while you're doing that I could do it with my hand because it's kind of it keeps it kind of light and fluffy okay so it's all mixed up and now the pan should be preheated and it's a nonstick pan so I just kind of shake the olive oil around a little bit to move it around and then that's what you want to hear they go on the pan and I do this by hand too and just kind of make it so it's fairly even throughout and then I just kind of bring in the edges so because the edges will get browner so I just kind of bring them in a little bit give it a little bit of a nice shape now I turn it down to there turn it down to medium low and now 15 minutes before you touch them you turn them over once and Vic and cook for another 50 minutes so you have to wait 15 minutes and I mean it I'm not kidding you go make the bed go make coffee drink coffee I don't care but 15 minutes you don't touch them you don't turn them do nothing okay don't make me come over there 15 minutes I love it okay it's been 15 minutes it's time first you want to check the bottom which we're gonna do but see how the edges are nice and brown and I think depending on you you have to figure out what your your stove and your pan work at this is like between medium and medium-low so and I'm gonna just check the bottom oh can you see that okay now this is a big thing to hash buns I'm going to try and flip it over okay wish me luck here I go ready and there look at that how awesome is that that's exactly what they should look like they smell good and if you're nervous about tea when you flip I when it's this big you may have to cut it to flip it over but when it's cooked right and browned it holds it together so but if you have to you can just take a spatula and slice it and flip it over now what I also do is I add I scoot it over to the side a little bit and again you want to use the biggest pan that you have and again a little bit more olive oil it'll help it really crisp up and brown just on the edges and then you'll see that's nice and hot and then I just kind of run it down like that turn it around that gets it all over and there we are now here's the deal 15 minutes don't touch it don't turn it don't just leave it alone I'll be back in 15 ok it's been 30 minutes you still want to check underneath and make sure they're done but it's looking pretty good let's take a peek under there look at that nice and brown and crisp fantastic turn off the stove bring it over here and it slides right off with my nonstick pant now seriously look it does not get any better than this look at that crispy golden hashbrowns here's the thing no butter heart-healthy olive oil only three things to remember squeeze out the moisture preheat the pan and thirty minutes that's what it takes to make these beautiful awesome oh my god if only I had ork but I don't look at this can you hear that that's that's that's it right there perfect hashbrowns oh you got try it 40 minutes I mean it I'll come to your house
