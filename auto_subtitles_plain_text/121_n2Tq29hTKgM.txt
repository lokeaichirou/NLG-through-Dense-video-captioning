 hi welcome to Chris cooks for you too today we're going to be trying my famous macaroni and cheese and it is really a great dish I think you're going to love it it's a lot of added cheese to the dish it's a lot of cheese that pool it's a lot of cheese that really gives it that flavor that you're actually looking for in macaroni and cheese I know there's a lot of versions to macaroni and cheeses some of them are really good but if you try this I think that your family's really going to love it now I've got to get the dish because I've already buttered the dish and I'm going to bring it over here now because macaroni and cheese is a messy dish what I'm going to do be doing today is I'm going to use a glove I have my macaroni that I've already prepared l Dante and it's already loose drained so what I'm going to do is to pour it into my buttered dish I want to tell you something bug this butter dish what you do to keep your macaroni from sticking okay you just buttered down whatever pan that you're going to use and this is kind of like the large casserole pain so this is only 1 pound of macaroni ok so now we have that all in the dish now to the dish I'm going to tell you what I'm going to be using today I'm going to use six types of cheese 1 cup of Monterey Jack two cups of mild cheddar 1 cup of mozzarella 1 cup of sharp cheddar one cup of provolone one little dish which is really one third of the Velveeta cheese 2 eggs 2 tablespoons of seasoning salt you use your favorite seasonings so some had some of more saltier than the others I use Laurie so that's a good seasoning so for me and actually have a third of a cup of butter now of course we have two teaspoons of sugar one cup of half-and-half and salt to taste so I'm going to mix all these ingredients in so we have the macaroni in the container or in our dish casserole dish into that I'm going to add my cheese okay and I started out with my mozzarella cheese and you can put your cheese in any order that's not going to really make a difference for that we're going to add for 2 cups of mild cheddar and you see that we're working that a little bit okay and to that we're going to add the one cup of Monterey Jack to that we're going to add one cup of the sharp cheddar cheese in the dish and then I'm sorry to use a bold and then they mix all of their cheeses and then once they get all the cheese's in and everything they're going to put in which is the eggs and the cream then they pour it into their casserole dish for me I do it this way sorry for the phone ring people always call in when you're trying to get something done okay next we're going to add to that the provolone cheese not what the provolone cheese does as well as the Monterey cheese I'm sorry not to moderate with the mozzarella what they do is gives you that pull that you're looking for when you pick up your cheese I'm sorry when you pick up your macaroni you want to get that cool like a lot of cheese as those are in the dish so what they actually do is they give you that pool that you're looking for not have all of these items in to that I'm going to add two tablespoons of sugar now it won't make it sweet but it will kind of balance it out you know so you have that it won't be too bitter it won't be too sweet it'll be just right so we're going to mix that in this looks pretty much good look to it right now okay so when we get that all mixed in and if you can see everything is evenly distributed we're going to add to that our butter okay my butter I'm going to add our seasoning salt the one we on the stalk we're going to solve it now for me that's not a lot of salt and I'm using sea salt because I'm sorry um I'm using kosher so because I use that a lot of dishes okay now we have that all mixed together it's good and bacon dish already okay and then the final ingredient that we're going to add is our eggs so we're going to beat our eggs up and because I have to squirrel one just our top beating that that didn't using my opposite hand and put them this is like the one dish casserole we don't have to do any cleaning because we have everything in the bowl the only thing that I would have done differently oops and some time ago I would have beat the eggs and have them be part beaten prior to start now once we do that we're going to add the last ingredient which is our Velveeta and if you see I put the Velveeta all through the mac and cheese and what I'm actually doing here is when you pick up the macaroni and cheese with your fork then not only do you have the pool cheese that's coming from your mozzarella and it's coming from your problem but you also have the burst of cheese that's coming from the Velveeta now Velveeta is not something that cook with an awfully lot but I do use it with the mac and cheese okay lastly we're going to pour in is the 1 cup of half and half and half cream has milk now you don't have to do any stirring at that point but I'm just going to do a little kind of like an old-school cook who and then sit that's all you need to do the stick you know what makes your macaroni stick together is going to be your eggs clean this up a little bit and then clean up my working area I'm going to take this I already have my oven preset to 350 and it's been warming already so I'm going to take this put it in the oven 350 for 25 to 30 minutes and we'll come back and see how that works out now we're going to take the macaroni and cheese out of the oven it's been that 25 30 minutes that I told you that we would need let's just pull this pan look at that look at that that is gorgeous macaroni and cheese as you can see it's bubbling around the sides you can see the Velveeta right in there you can see it has that little like crusty top but it's not hard it's still soft we're going to let this sit for a few minutes okay which is about five minutes before we cut it gonna cut in it just to show you what it is to where we actually have here okay now I want to focus on I'm not trying to take too much but I was trying to see if I could have got some of the pull but I can't seem to get it up I see a little bit of the Velveeta not going to dig down into you know the mac and cheese but then you see how because we use the butter see how easy it comes away from the dish okay then we're going to add that to the plate all right then we're going to go over to the table and we're going to sample this fantastic and until next time bye
