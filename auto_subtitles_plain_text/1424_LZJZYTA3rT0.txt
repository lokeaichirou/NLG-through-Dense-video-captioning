 sweet potato topped cottage pie Margaret's going to start by chopping up a red onion and a red pepper although you could use another color pepper if you prefer now while Margaret's chopping do you know the difference between cottage pie and shepherd's pie shepherd's pie has lamb the clue is in the title Shepherd anyway I just thought I'd cover that off cottage pie beef shepherd's pie lamb a Margaret still chopping so once your vegetables are chopped spray some spray oil into a pan and you're going to add your vegetables and fry until soft once the vegetables are nice and soft you're going to add your lean mints but without the plastic that's on the bottom of the mint add a touch of lazy garlic or a clove of garlic if you have and fry the Mint's until brown looking good next you're going to add a pint of beef stock cover and then simmer to reduce the liquid down now while that's simmering you can start chopping your sweet potato now obviously you can use real potato on cottage pie when I say real obviously the sweet potato is also real more normal white potato but sweeter sweet potato makes a little bit of a different kind of meal it's also slightly better for you so chop your sweet potato put in a saucepan and bring to the boil after adding a little bit of salt now while you're sweet potatoes boiling you can add a little bit of gravy granules to the mincemeat this will just help thicken the sauce and help the flavor a little bit as well then when you're sweet potatoes boiled you can drain steam up the camera and then of course return to the pot for mashing always nice thing to add some frozen peas to your cottage pie mix that'll help cool the mixture down which you need to do when you've put it in a bowl because that will help the potato not sink into the meat mixture you can add a bit of milk to your sweet potato and mash away beat it about another wooden spoon that'll make it really smooth next when the mixture has cooled start spooning your sweet potato mash on to the top always slightly easier to start on the outside and work in and then to finish it off you can smooth it all down with a fork looking great place in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes at 200 degrees and it comes out hot and boiling and bubbling beautiful sweet potato topped cottage pie
