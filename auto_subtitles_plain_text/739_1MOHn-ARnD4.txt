 g'day guys and welcome today I'm making one of my all-time favorites I eat far too much of this it is that good and it's very easy to make at home so for starters I've got a hot wok I'm adding a bit of oil and straight in with the seafood I'm using some horns some mussels and some scallops scallops aren't common in a laksa but I like them so I'm going to use them you can also opt for chicken instead of seafood this step will take a couple of minutes once that seafood is cooked just remove it from the wok and here I've got some chopped onion I'm just going to lightly brown this and now I'm adding some lexer paste this is available in the Asian section of your supermarket and I'm using a couple of tablespoons it's a case of personal taste here adjust to how strong you want the flavour in your soup and I'm just going to cook this for about a minute or so until it becomes nice and aromatic and now to add some coconut milk I've got a 400 milk can of coconut milk here now you can use the whole thing but I'm going to use half of it and make up the other half with some water I'm also using light coconut milk and what this does is it just makes it a little bit healthier but of course if you want the full flavor punch use the full fat coconut milk and use the whole can so once that comes to the simmer I'm adding in some vegetables I've got some julienned carrots also got a bit of broccoli of course it's your choice of vegetables I'm also going to add some deep fried tofu I've made a video on how to make this at home so you can check that out if you like I'll put a link down below in the description bar and the soup party is done it's time to put this together so into a bowl I'm adding some hockey and noodles I've also got some thin rice noodles here of course you can use your choice of noodles now it's time to add that seafood on top followed by the tofu and the broccoli and then I'm just going to ladle the rest of that soup over the top beautiful stuff guys and to top it off I'm just going to sprinkle over some chopped spring onions as well as some fried shallots these are also available in the Asian section of your supermarket and they are great on top of any noodle soup so give them a go if you haven't tried them before and you're done guys enjoy as I said this is one of my all-time favorites I eat it at least a couple of times a month so give it a go be sure to check out my barbecue cooking channel my Google+ and my Facebook pages I'll put links down in the description bar along with the full list of ingredients for today's recipe thanks for watching and I will catch you all next time
