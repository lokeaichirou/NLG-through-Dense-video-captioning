 hey everyone I'm Judith Jones food and travel editor of the gourmet Travel ISTA and today I'm going to be showing you how to make it grilled ham and cheese sandwich delicious that's all you need on a cold winter's day so what you're going to need is two slices of white bread three to four slices of cheese I've used Gruyere cheese which is a Swiss cheese two slices of ham and two tablespoons of butter now we have a cast-iron pan here which we've already preheated to medium heat and it's nice and smoking we want to get that cast iron pan nice and hot for our grilled cheese sandwiches so let's get our white bread and let's get our butter on the bread you can never have too much butter on a grilled cheese that's what I say so we'll spread that over there obviously if you prefer to use margarine what have you you can do that where I use the good stuff the real stuff all right got a nice generous amount on there lots of layering because that's going to go onto our hot pan and make our bread nice and brown and crunchy so do it on both sides so once we've loaded our butter onto our gorgeous bread right here let's put our bread butter face down onto our cuts iron pan you see that's gonna sizzle right there now let's get our lovely Gruyere cheese on top of this this is as I said is a Swiss cheese you'll see it a lot in quiches in a croque madame brook Monsieur and it's really a great cheese to use when cooking it's kind of got a distinct flavor but yet it's not too overwhelming so it's a good one so as that's going it's gone up there we'll got our cheese onto our bread right there now let's get our ham obviously if you want to go a fancy you can do like first time or the ham of your choosing you're just going to cut it in half here to make it things easier [Music] that's just yes lovely so you got your ham your cheese and that's going to use onto there and then finally let's get our other side of our bed butter slice up we're going to put that on top so we're going to leave that for a couple of minutes and let that get nice and brown so we've been a couple of minutes and so I think it's just about done oh yes very nice nice and golden brown crispy and our cheese is just using in there that is your ham and grilled cheese sandwich thanks for watching today everyone and make sure to subscribe to our website to watch plenty of other fantastic videos and if you have an email request you can email requests at Mahalo calm and we'll be sure to answer any questions and queries you might have [Music]
