 joining us today's episode is going to be on a topic called beats I'm a Guinea that the famous mag Anita it was actually the flavor combination was created by the Queen Margherita margarita that like the color combination and obviously the flavor and all the ingredients our pizza base we have a pizza base recipe video if you want to do as well you can have one already mate or make your own whatever it is but we have my site baguettes you can have passata is just peeled tomatoes passed through and machine to actually make and make them into like a a puree or you can pull tomatoes and the tin and use a stick blender to actually make them into a your a type of very runny sauce and also you can cook it if you like personally I don't I like to have it a little bit on the pizza and cook it in there because the flavor is lighter and also the texture and the intensity of it is a lot lighter and more delicate and I find it better to digest that way otherwise it's cooked and then it's cooked again in the oven and I don't really enjoy that upper food the other way I just have it straight out of the jar or the tin whatever the case may be and we've also got more Kanchana I'm gonna have in addition to the tomato puree or the Posada is actually fresh tomatoes cut in slices I'll show you somebody ganache some salt over the top of that and always some fresh basil and this is the typical combination are they imagine it now and we'll do that right away we'll just take out the center just in some nice thin slices cut the bocconcini as well and some slices put this down first almost first just put that over the top nicely nice oh maybe not too close to the edge first tomato on that because I love it a bit of salt on the tomorrow itself then won't it be let's say you're gonna get some of this beautiful pizza a cheese it is what Conchita is about continue cheese that alone and now we're gonna put a little bit of salt out of that as well a little bit of what Egon all this gives a little bit of sweetness and some fresh basil you can grab some olive oil and the good thing about this is we're gonna put some now and we're also gonna add some fresh basil just after we pull it out of the oven because that will give it a bit more fragrance as well because the basil might be cooked it'll be more vibrant as a basil intensity because it just goes beautifully with that we got plenty of Bethel there Thank You Jess if you want to run that on me just run it all I ever thought of that you got the touch perfect wonderful thank you so much and we'll put that in a preheated oven and it will be done in about 15-20 minutes throw some fresh basil on there and this is one of those pizzas will all the Italian pizzas we don't put too much topping on them you know because we really maximize the flavor just from the small amount of ingredients because in life you don't have to have a lot of everything you know to really appreciate what is that particular thing at that moment in time so it's about appreciating and maximizing the intensity of each and every individual thing that we can do with life so this is the margarita we're just about to cut this up and how we're going to do that is with some scissors that's the best way bluefin down at the pizza cutter and we'll do that right now and we'll serve it up joseph is right here to enjoy the taste as well laughs it's gonna be really really hot so let that cool down a bit well and it's so sweet this is drop-dead gorgeous la margarita pizza margherita with eternity class welcome to the stage
