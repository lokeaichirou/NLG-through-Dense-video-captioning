 hey chef Jason Hill here and one day I came home and I found my daughter cooking up some pancakes it is super good super easy and you'll never want to buy one of those boxed pancake mixes again let me show you okay I've put together my meson gloss things in place here and it came together really quick started with two level cups of all-purpose flour you need about one and a half to two cups of milk whole milk I've got two tablespoons of butter that I'm gonna melt down on the microwave and a half teaspoon of kosher salt a couple of large eggs and this is two teaspoons of baking powder and a tablespoon of sugar which is optional then I'm gonna add a drop or two of vanilla okay first thing we're going to do is combine all of the dry ingredients next we're gonna beat two eggs into the milk okay now I'm gonna whisk in the melted butter and after I pull it out of the microwave I let it sit for a little bit I don't want to put it in there piping hot now we're gonna gently mix in the milk and egg to moisten the flour and don't worry if you have a few lumps in here well that's about the consistency I like and then finally my little touch I like to do is just add a drop or two of vanilla extract okay I'm gonna put my burners on about medium-high and I like this little flat top griddle that I have then you can use a regular pan we're gonna get that nice and preheated okay a good way to test the sefer griddle is hot enough you just take your hand he pushed him on there for a good I don't know 10 seconds or so and if you remove your hand you got a nice red tip to it it's ready just kidding do a couple of water drops and as soon as those bubble off like that your pan is hot and i season my griddle i like to use a little butter you can use pan spray or oil you like I've got a high temp spatula here so what won't melt onto the griddle we have about 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake and spread a little bit of that round now at this point too you can add different things to your pancake batter throw in some fresh blueberries chocolate chips you can tell your pancakes are starting to cook by looking at these little bubbles on the edges so this is gonna be the first one I'm going to turn come over here all right and once you flip them they only need half the time on the other side all right after they're done you can put them on a plate that's ovenproof and put them in to a warm oven anywhere between 180 to 200 degrees and then you can serve up the whole family at once okay I'm gonna keep it simple today just do a little bit of butter on each one drizzling fresh real maple syrup I guess it's not fresh but it's real expensive stuff here but it's the best well I just like to fake my daughter for finding this easy recipe it's really really good and as always thanks for tubing in mmm so good you can't even compare this to the stuff you buy in the box you
