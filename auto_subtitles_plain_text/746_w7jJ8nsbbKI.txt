 I'm Julia Moscone today we're making simple mashed potatoes Yukon Gold and russets have the best consistency for making a good fluffy mash here we're using a mix of both to start peel the potatoes while you bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat when the water is boiling add the potatoes let them cook for about 15 to 20 minutes in the meantime melt the butter and warm the milk that will be added to the potatoes from mashing you can do this in 1 saucepan now check on the potatoes they're done cooking when easily pierced do not under cook them drain the potatoes and return them to the pot this will help dry them out begin to mash the potatoes this is a basic masher if you like you can use a ricer which gives a fluffier consistency for whipped potatoes use a hand or stand mixer as you mash pour in the butter and milk mixture when you reach the consistency you like taste and add the salt and pepper if necessary mashed potatoes can take a lot of salt so don't hold back keep the potatoes hot until ready to serve
