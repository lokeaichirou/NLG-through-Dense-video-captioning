 good night and welcome to family Mills Sunday today I'm going to cook a variation of a recipe that there's literally thousands off I don't think this country on Earth that doesn't have a variation of meatballs today I want to show you my recipe for spaghetti and meatballs now for this meat ball of spaghetti recipe you need some mince meat some pasta hey pass the sauce of your choice 1 chopped onion some chopped up cheese 1 egg and basil into a large bowl crack one egg and give it a good whisk then putting your onions and your cheese and a generous amount of basil then give it a good stir to combine all the ingredients next place the beef into the bowl and give it a good mix use your fingers in your hands and mix it all the way in there as with all red meat make sure once you're finished you properly wash your hands to prevent cross-contamination now lightly grease your fry pan using your hands grab out small amounts of the meats make it into a nice firm ball then put it onto the fry pan now you just want to lightly sear the outside of these balls even with a turn every now and then see to cook them for a total of two to three minutes once our Lord has done take them out to put them into a spare bowl and then just put the next slide on until they're all done okay I'm just cooking the second load now once we're done here we'll be on to the next step once the second load of meatballs are done place the first stop back into the fry pan next pour over your pasta sauce once most of the mix is out put it onto the top for a little bit just put a little bit of water in there give it a good shake and then you go put the rest into the front now give it a good mix to all the meatballs are completely covered with the sauce once done place the lid on and you gotta let it simmer for about 20 minutes until all the meatballs are cooked all the way through now place your pasta into a boiling pot of water and a pinch of salt they can break them in half if you like but I like them nice and long so I'm going to let the water soften them up and just move them all in once the pastor's cooks we gonna drain it and put it onto a plate then put the meatballs on top now don't they look fantastic let's give this a taste mmm mmm no that just takes outstanding thank you for watching Todd's kitchen be sure to join me again this Monday for muffin Monday
