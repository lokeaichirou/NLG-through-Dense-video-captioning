 hi I'm it tonight we're gonna make Vina schnitzel here's everything we need to make Venus schnitzel I'm using thin cuts of pork the you'll also see traditional veal but I like pork it's a little less expensive it's also very traditional Austrian and what we're gonna do is pound the pork very thin I do it in a plastic bag we'll show you that in a minute and then we're going to coat it with flour eggs breadcrumbs I use I like to use the panko ones it gives a nice crunch but you can use any decent breadcrumbs you know the usual salt pepper and we're gonna cook this in clarified butter that's very traditional if you don't have clarified butter you can use regular vegetable oil but I make clarified butter we have an episode on that so let's get started with pounding the pork we want to pound our little pork slices into very thin sleek scallopini x' can have your butcher do it some places will do it for you stir about a quarter of an inch thick if you want to get them as thin as you can so what I do is I open up a gallon size plastic bag just one side with a pair of scissors with a kitchen mallet you can use a rubber mallet from the garage it's not gonna get dirty because the pork is inside this bag and we take each one of the scaloppini Zout now and put it on a plate when they're all done then we're gonna season them so salt and peppered our little pork cutlet schnitzels and we just make a little assembly line go flour first and then just some eggs couple eggs I just whipped up with a fork and then into our bread crumbs as I mentioned I like to use the panko ones you can use regular ones if you want to get a good coating all this and you don't want to crowd these in the frying pan so I'm just gonna do two at a time until their uh and then cook those two and then prepare another two because we want to just brown them very very quickly even if they're not totally cooked then we put them in the oven at 250 degrees to finish cooking but these are gonna cook super fast this is about literally like one minute on each side okay so let's take these guys back over to the frying pan and get them going I'm gonna heat up our clarified butter first we want it to be pretty hot certainly not smoking but and we want a fair amount of this I probably put about four tablespoons in here because we don't we want it to be you know maybe look 1/8 or to a quarter of an inch of oil on the bottom of this again you could use vegetable if you had to but the taste is incredible with clarified butter our clarified butter is nice and hot gonna put our little scallopini cutlets in here and they should just sizzle nicely literally we're gonna cook these for about a minute if we can adjust the heat now that they're in they'll bring the temperature down a little bit so I'm gonna turn it down I think it's sizzling very nicely I wanna burn them a little over a minute has passed so I'm gonna flip these guys over it should be just a light golden brown you want to make them dark brown another minute on this side okay now that we've cooked them on the other side for about a minute light golden brown we're gonna put them onto a baking sheet with some paper towel and into the oven at 250 to finish cooking while we cook the next batch and then we'll bring these out and add it to that next batch so our second batch of take that at this point I see we're running we've used up a lot of our clarified butter so I'm gonna add another tablespoon or two for our last batch here's our last piece finished a little over a minute on each side back in the oven at 250 to keep warm while we cook up some eggs I love to finish finish it so you could just finish it with a squirt of lemon that would be fine but my family likes it with a little fried egg on the top so I just use the same pan with the same clarified butter and I put in the correct number of eggs there's three of us eating dinner tonight over easy a little higher that down and as soon as they're cooked we'll put them right on top of the schnitzels yeah alright that cooked on one side I'm just gonna turn them over so that they're nice over over easy you could just put them on like that obviously if you like them that way I'm just gonna let them cook for literally maybe 10 seconds on this side and then right on to the schnitzel alright so there we go use our Venus schnitzel so here we have our V nurse schnitzel either with an egg on top or a little bit of lemon spritz of lemon there you go Vina schnitzel made with pork enjoy
