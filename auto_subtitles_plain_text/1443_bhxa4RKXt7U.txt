 hello I'm Adrienne and this is xoxo cooks where we have a new recipe every weekend it's a tubular life today I'm very special yes my name is Kathy I've read the book not eating ebony or and I were the book the art of meeting hit so come touch again this is the thom dish and it's very spicy first we're going to marinate the chicken a little bit of soy sauce and there Chuck kind of bite-sized pieces we also marinated with just a teaspoon of cornstarch let it chill about 20 minutes while we prepare the rest of the ingredients I'm just gonna give it a rough chop maybe a couple slices Chinese like to put them on a bias so yeah make a little cornstarch slurry grab about maybe a teaspoon that looks good to me half a cup of water so we're just gonna leave this on the side we're going to also use some Chinese rice wine you don't drink it dovin Jang and that's signature sauce from Sichuan it has fermented being based and to leave it a little kiss of acid at the end and this is a black vinegar similar to you know balsamic vinegar there's a flavor combination and citron cooking called mala which translates to numbing hot these are plot our spicy and these are numbing so such one peppercorns have this really interesting numbing effect on your palate but when you combine it with this you get this weird mouth-watering numbing hot sensation remove as many of the season break them and she come out there we go Coast the sitch one peppercorns in a dry pan now the pan should be really hot you want to just toss it a little bit and if you don't have such one peppercorns you can just use some black peppercorns or just skip it just as soon as you start smelling that really floral nice fragrance take them off that's good just sort of break them open so we have a couple tablespoons of canola oil like so I'm gonna check at the top no not really hang on sec not good enough all right you don't want to touch them just yet or stir them so that they may be brown a little bit on the bottom after about a minute start stir it around that's this point we're not cooking it all the way through I like using chopsticks whenever I stir fry splashmore oil that's more flavors garlic and ginger now we're going to have these crazy going to be hot or scallions save some of the green cards to throw in at the end for a little fresh melon to love I also don't want to burn the chili it's really easy to burn the chili rice wine make sure the pan is nice and hot yeah Bridget around you get this flavorful stuff from the bottom turns into more like a cigarette sauce as some of this stuff in town sauce chili bean sauce a little bit soy sauce to taste and unless but not leave to make this a little juicier soft here boissier take our cornstarch slurry give it another stir for just a little bit in store immediately see how how much soft it out turn off the heat that's when we add to John peppercorn extra scallions so take it off the heat first then stir in the black vinegar then you taste you want to eat it yeah grateful thanks for coming on the show Kathy thanks so much for having me drink and check out our blog not hanging out in New York
