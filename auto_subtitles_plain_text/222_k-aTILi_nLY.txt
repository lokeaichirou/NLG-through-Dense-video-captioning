 [Music] hey guys and welcome to my rat's kitchen today I'm gonna make fast-food style hashbrowns so here we go I'm going to start with two potatoes I'm gonna peel the potatoes and Strait them with a thick shredder you basically want take shreds of potatoes now in a bowl I'm going to add a teaspoon of salt and very very cold water in fact so cool I'm you in one add ice then I'm going to transfer my shredded potatoes in my bone and I'm gonna keep it in that for about 15 to 20 minutes so basically what we want is just to remove the excess amount of starch now for the next step you're gonna need lots of muscle power so I'm going to strain all the water out of my straight edge potatoes that have been kept in the water I'm going to squeeze the potatoes in batches till all the water has been drained now this is a very crucial step you need to remove the water from all the potatoes you can actually see the amount of starch that has been removed from the potatoes I'm going to remove any excess water with paper towel water should not be there all right keep that in mind now in a pan I'm gonna add some butter and transfer my potato I'm gonna cook them on medium and not all the way through now what you want is basically the potato should be kind of power boiled potatoes not wholly cooked potatoes already you don't want them to turn brown so basically each trait should be a bit firm but not very firm as you can see all right I'm gonna transfer potatoes in about let it cool for about ten to fifteen minutes so that I can work on them after that I'm gonna add onion powder some salt potato powder cornstarch rice flour and finally a tablespoon of water you can see all the information and all the measurements in the description bar down below I'm going to mix it all up and then add some more rice flour alright so basically rice flour is added to combine and provide that crispness [Music] now no butter paper I'm going to transfer my potato mixture cover it with another butter paper flatten it with the rolling pin and be careful you don't want to over flatten them you basically want them to be around a centimeter thick and then refrigerate it to four to six hours so that you can easily cut them in standard highest round shapes in my case it is triangle so you can go in any width shape what you want you can cut them easily and they're refrigerated and they're freezed so apparently the video has moved faster and my speech has been delayed but the last step is basically simple frying you need hot oil and you need to golden fry your hashbrowns somewhat like this now the real taste of hash brown would be the crispy test right let's go on test the real crispy test now this was recorded 15 to 20 minutes after frying and to our insult to injury I would say oh yeah now you can see how crispy they are and this is all this is all been done in real time as you know my poor editing skills so do subscribe to my channel thanks for watching fast food style hashbrown I hope you liked the video [Music] and thanks for watching
