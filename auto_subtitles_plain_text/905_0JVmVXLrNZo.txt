 you can make good burgers outside on the grill but to make great burgers inside or out you want to cook on a flattop or a cast-iron skillet I'm going to make two kinds of burgers today the first is the kind you find in bars and pubs and taverns it's about six to eight ounces of meat made into a patty you'll see all those little bits of fat in there that's the most important thing 80% meat 20% fat I'm going to take it to about medium high we hear the sizzle and everything is good the second kind of hamburger is diner style it's flatter it's lighter this is only a three and a half or four ounces of meat and right away I'm going to take a heavy spatula and I'm going to commit this heresy I'm going to press the burger down it's only going to cook for about a minute and a half on this side then I'm going to turn it over we're going to season with a little salt and a little pepper this meat that I used was cold from the fridge there's a lot of times where we talk about letting me come to room temperature before cooking it with burgers that's not the case you want those little studded bits of fat I showed you to be nice and cold so then they don't smear but that they actually melt so now there's a good crust there and the darkness is kind of beginning to come up over the cliff and onto the plateau at the top of the burger and I just slide in and I turn it over very easily boom and you can see this deep crusting here all the way around the burger there's a fancy scientific term for that the my yard reaction meanwhile our pattern burger is still cooking so I think this first guy is just about ready I'm going to take a bun oh man that looks good and put it right there think we're about ready to turn this one over so I slide under there and we turn it so here we have the blank slate of hamburgers this is the moment where you add cheese if you're adding cheese in order to get the cheese nice and melted you want to add it the minute you turn that burger over because you're not going to touch it again until you pull it off this is one of the big issues with hamburger cooking is that people want to mess with it they want to touched and when a prod don't do that allow the burger to sit in the pan and allow the fat to do its work within don't mess with a hamburger too much and it'll love you back all right so we pick it up and that is a pretty luscious looking hamburger of perfect size and comportment that's American and there you have it folks two versions of an American classic the diner style and the pub style both of them cooked in a cast-iron pan
