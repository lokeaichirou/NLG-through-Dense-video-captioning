 [Music] today I'm gonna show you how to make one of my favorite tacos tacos de lengua which actually translates to beef tongue so I have all my mise and plos here I'm gonna sautee them first because they take a few minutes I have onions garlic a little bit of oil step over here get that going and we're gonna sweat them to bring out the flavor I love that sound so good I'm low here alright and then I have some jalapenos with the seeds and veins removed take a little bit of the heat away alright so I'm gonna add that if you use jalapenos wear gloves guys because the oil will irritate your skin and if you touch your eyes you're gonna hate yourself alright and then I have a little mince up front there which will also add a nice flavor to the braising liquid all right so that sweating smells delicious alright I have some stock here some aromatics which I'm gonna add next and so I just want to talk about this really quickly well this is sweating so beef tongue is a muscle and it is very firm and it requires a long time to cook so give yourself at least two and a half hours the front is very lean the back is more fatty and the fat is what makes this thing amazing so if you ask me this is my favorite piece but we're gonna chop it up and mix it together so it's a little more even in uniform so I think we're perfect here nice color I'm just going to add the aromatic add the mint stir it up a little bit and some water here you want to submerge it you can also roast the tongue it's entirely up to you I'm just a fan of braising because you can let the meat stay in the liquid and it'll make it a little easier to preserve it'll allow it to you know keep a little more flavor I'm putting in vinegar now adds a nice acidity to it lastly I'm gonna put some stock I'm a huge fan of stock it just adds a nice base flavor if you want to be neutral you can use vegetable stock which is what I do a lot you can use chicken if you want if you're gonna use beef I would use it just to cook beef so we have vegetables here with this you don't really need to do anything to it to prep when it's done cooking you're gonna be able to peel this really coarse these are like the taste buds be able to peel that right off that's how you'll know it's done so now I'm gonna take the tongue I'm gonna put it in the braising pot here and I would say you don't necessarily need to submerge the whole thing here because you're gonna put a top on it and it's gonna keep the heat going all around but that liquids gonna reduce over time and you're gonna have an amazing little broth slash sauce that you can ladle over it in about 2 and 1/2 hours later we're just gonna take a little knife and see if we can easily cut a piece off see if it's ready all right so we've been patiently waiting for the language abraeve we're at about 3 hours now you should really just feel inside you want the meat to just pull off so tender so what we're gonna do now take this beautiful beef tongue put it down watch out it's really hot I can use your knife to help you see how just peels right off it's so beautiful that's how you know it's done too so we're just gonna I'm gonna hold off doing it all but I'm instead gonna cut my favorite part of the tongue which is the bottom part right down underneath because it has higher fat content and it is so delicious okay we are it's right here you can see the beautiful layers of fat in the middle that is what's gonna make your taco absolutely amazing chop it up I'm gonna save a little bit of the broth here to soak the meat in because once you cut this up you're gonna be exposing a lot of the meat to the flavor here whereas before it was right in the center of the tongue now you have an opportunity really just absorb all that foot so my guess is so good all right so tortilla pan heating right behind me yes right here awesome we're gonna go simple here we want to highlight the flavor of the beef we have tomato salsa fresh avocados lime everything is very mild it's gonna show off how awesome our beef is so I'm just gonna check this won't add a little color and then we're ready to build this baby then guys once you taste this you won't even think twice that it's done go tongs see how moist that is this is why I like to braise instead of roast see you still have some of the jalapenos and onions in here beautiful all right [Music] and if you want to spice it up a little bit we have some hot sauce all right Wow it's so good right there that is a taco de lengua [Music]
