 [Music] hi everybody and welcome back to cooking here today in this episode we're making of a fast and easy grilled cheese sandwich now you might say to yourself all making them is so easy which it is but there is a little technique that will allow you to make them so much easier so let's get started to get started here we're going to add about a tablespoon of butter to the pan I'm using my funky egg roll pan simply because I like the grill marks a lot of people have asked where they can get these and you can get them from our amazon store I'll put a link below now that our butter is nicely melted down I'm going to turn the heat back to medium-low and place the first slice of bread in now what I'm gonna do is lay the cheddar cheese over the top you can use slice to grate it if you want of course I'm gonna use just enough cheese to cover the bread and we'll place the top layer of bread on and I'm going to give this a little press down and we're gonna let this cook for about 3 minutes after 3 minutes I'm gonna add another half a tablespoon of butter to the pan will flip the grilled cheese over and allow it to cook for an additional 3 minutes it's interesting because I don't know how many times in the past I've struggled with trying to spread the butter over the bread and ripping the bread up this method is so much easier after 3 minutes we're going to remove the grilled cheese from the pan and look at that perfectly done and beautiful grill marks so I'm just going to give this a slice diagonally with my knife and you're ready to serve and there you have it our simple easy and perfect grilled cheese sandwich so that was our grilled cheese sandwich I hope you try this technique and let us know what you think if you have a sandwich recipe you'd like us to cook to make your life a little bit easier leave us a comment below head on over to cook and share calm for more easy recipes and remember to click to subscribe and like our videos thanks for watching and see you next time [Music] you
