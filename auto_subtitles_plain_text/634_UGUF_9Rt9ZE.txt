 today on Nico's kitchen people go he is a common Korean dish and it's packed full of flavor we're making my beef bulgogi so first thing we're gonna make our marinade for our beef bulgogi and I love the flavors in this sweet salty and then when we grill it later nice smokiness as well so just into a food processor I'm gonna be adding in some pears now I'm just using a normal pair but if you can get your hands on a nashi pear the ones that look almost like an apple use them instead they've got such a wonderful flavor I'm also gonna be adding in some chopped onion some garlic cloves for our sauces I'm just gonna add in a few drops of sesame oil for some saltiness some soy sauce I'm also gonna be adding in a dollop of honey as well and I'm also gonna be adding in some sake as well which is a Japanese rice wine you could just use water as a substitute as well now we just want to combine this in the food processor until you can see here we've got a nice puree now this is exactly what we're after and the flavors in here are just incredible so now I've got my thinly sliced steak here now the steak I used today the beef was the porterhouse cut now you can use Scotch fill it rump the top side it's completely up to you so what I do to get a nice even cut on the beef I just pop it into the freezer just for a couple of hours and it just makes it so much easier to cut through and get a nice even cut so now just pour over that pur√©ed mixture onto the beef and just mix the beef around get it all nicely coated so we're gonna pop this into the fridge now and marinate it for at least one hour but preferably you would do this overnight now another little tip you can make this ahead of time you could pop this into a ziploc bag and put it in the freezer and then you can just bring it out when you want to use it over a high heat on the stove or barbecue place beef in and sear you want a nice caramelization on the beef and cook in batches for only one to two minutes serve with rice or kimchi and sprinkle some sesame seeds over the beef to serve and now let's get stuck into this bad boy so I just love this dish when we have it quite often because it is just packed full of flavor from top to bottom and we serve it up with some rice you can serve it up with some kimchi if you want to do but we love it with rice we soaked up all those beautiful juices from that marinade that we had that we made before that soaked them to be fair but anything guys please give this a try it is truly one of those dishes where you eat it and you just sit back and go the flavors here are just wonderful and it becomes one of the staples in the family I'm gonna guarantee it that you will have this more than once it's cheap to do easy to put together and very very easy to make give this one a try you're going to absolutely love it
