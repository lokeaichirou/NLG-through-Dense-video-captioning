 [Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I am so excited to share with you my fried chicken recipe I've had this requested here for years and years and the reason why I've been holding off on is because I feel like along with a lot of recipes Fried Chicken is something people are very territorial territorial about and they only like it their way or no way and if it's not the way they make and then it's not authentic and I'm not saying mine's authentic by any means it's authentically delicious and this is a recipe I go to for just a classic fried chicken recipe everyone loves it for the base you just need a few ingredients which is gonna be your chicken and I'll talk about this in a minute the key is some buttermilk and some hot sauce now there's gonna be more ingredients to come but this is the base this is what's incredibly important number one this by the way I dissolve our batali rules number one the rule is the chicken must be bone-in skin-on if it's not bone-in or skin-on do yourself a favor and girls and chicken breast and you're good to go nothing wrong with it whatsoever it's not gonna be fried chicken in my opinion not really good fried chicken the second thing is you need buttermilk because the buttermilk what's gonna do it's going to incredibly that it's a bit I think that makes your chicken incredibly tender it's a tenderizer so once it sits in it for a few hours if that's magic now I know some people you use like a water and salt mixture to brine their chicken which works just as well I've eaten it that way and delicious I prefer buttermilk now the pieces of chicken you used for buttermilk ought to you for me it's got to be dark meat which is why I use the leg and the thigh you can use drumstick and the thigh you can use the breast make sure it's bone-in skin-on and cut it in half otherwise the breast is way too big if you go to your butcher you should be able to buy pieces already broken like this or do you local supermarket they'll have packs of chicken already cut up and I always choose the dark meat you need about three pounds total but this is what I'm using so enough said let's get this thing going the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to take my chicken again in on whatever pieces you prefer if you want to do the wing if you want to do the breast and make sure you cut it in half cuz that's really important now you can add any hot sauce you want to this you can use Tabasco you can use a buffalo sauce but for me my all-time favorite hot sauce is sriracha so I'm gonna use a really good squirt of it because I like a little bit of heat into my buttermilk mix this up it's gonna be really lovely and spicy and pour this all over my chicken Oh looks so good and you can really smell the chili and the garlic from the sriracha it's just oh it's delicious so now I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cover this first of all you want to make sure that your chicken is really covered in the buttermilk I'm gonna cover this I'm gonna pop it into the fridge a minimum of two hours or you could do this overnight I'm gonna leave it in there for a few hours I've got some things to do so it's gonna sit in there and perform its magic and when we come when I come back I'm going to show you the second step which is this is important I think I just took my chicken out of the fridge that's put in there for several hours so I know it's done its job overnight it's even better not gonna lie so now all I'm gonna do is actually making the second part of a fried chicken which is the flour the flour coating but I have here is some all-purpose flour and add to this I'm gonna add in some spices my favorite combination is some steak seasoning but you want to make sure that you buy the kind of salt free I've also got granulated onion and garlic and I've got paprika you can add whatever you want you know whatever you feel like tastes really good to you I want a little extra black pepper even though there's a lot of black pepper in this big seasoning I want a little extra and I always make sure that you buy your season a minute I love seasoning but I think it's fantastic buy them salt free because sometimes if you don't they are so salty it's impossible to put um you know enough to have good flavor without your food tasting super salty so I'm gonna do now is just stir this together you know whisk it together would not you want to make sure that the seasoning is distributed well throughout the flour and I also have a cast iron skillet there with some and oil that's been preheating I want that to be around 365 degrees and I also have my oven on to 375 because that's what we're gonna finish the chicken because sometimes what happens is by the time it's fully cooked through the outside it gets really dark and we don't want that I've got a baking dish your baking sheet here with a cooling rack on top and that's because I just took this out of the fridge now I want this to come to temperature for about 20 minutes I want this to come to room temperature for a good 20 minutes otherwise if we were to cook this straight in the hot oil it's cold so it's gonna seize up and you're gonna have a really tough chicken so you want to always let your meat rest of room temperature for about 20 minutes before you cook it now what I do is I take my chicken and see if I can do like an assembly line I take my chicken by the hot sauce and buttermilk coat it really well in that flour mixture make sure it's really nicely coated and then I just put it on my baking rack here and what happens is it not only comes to room temperature and it's resting a little bit but the flour kind of dries up a little bit and sticks to the chicken and therefore when you put it in the hot oil all the excess flour isn't going to burn so I'm just gonna continue to to do that let those sit for about 20 minutes and then we'll fry them up my chickens been sitting at room temperature for 20 minutes and as you can see the flour has kind of like adhered to the batter which is exactly what we want is gonna create a beautiful crust now I've got my oven preheated to 375 I also have another baking dish here and then have it lined with aluminum foil just you know just coz just going to a side sometimes and I've got a wire rack on top because we want to keep the chicken elevated at all times we're gonna start the chicken in the hot oil we're gonna finish cooking it in the oven so I've got my peanut oil here preheated it should be really nice and hot I'm gonna do this in two batches presentation side down so skin side down yes see those bubbles that's what you're looking for it's only gonna be in the hot oil for four to five minutes on each side not gonna be long enough to cook the chicken completely which is why we're gonna pop this back into the oven now I'm gonna do this because the thighs are really big I'm gonna do four of the drumsticks I'm gonna let those cook I've got a splatter screen here I'm gonna tidy up and clean up cook them on both sides and so they're a beautiful crispy golden-brown color put them on a wire rack I'll show you what they look like so we can put the whole thing in the oven I just took my last three pieces of chicken out of the hot oil they only cooked for about four minutes on each side cuz you really want to make sure that oil is really nice and hot so that all you're doing at this point really is cooking the outside it makes sure that the crispy crust is happening and then you're gonna continue cooking the rest the inside in the oven now the reason why again it's on a wire rack is because you want to make sure the chicken is elevated otherwise if you want to put your chicken pieces straight on your baking sheet what's gonna happen the bottom is gonna get soggy you don't want that you want the air to Jews around I made up that word that's right you want the error to circle around the chicken and get crispy I'll continue no remain crispy and the inside is gonna cook so I'm gonna put this in the oven at 375 for another 10 to 15 minutes I want to test it with an instant their mom and Sarita thermometer it should read 165 degrees Fahrenheit let those rest for about five minutes and then we all ready to dig in my chicken was in the oven for exactly 12 minutes so make sure you have an instant-read thermometer on hand just to check it cuz you don't want to overcook it cuz I think goes dry you don't want to dry fried chicken not me now why don't you point something out if you don't like your fried chicken as dark as I do because I really like a deep deep golden crispy brown you can certainly cook it less just keep with eye on I may be cooking on for three minutes on each side instead of four minutes on each side it's completely up to you just keep in mind that the color on the crust is the color you want to eat it so the insights and the continue cooking in the oven so if you like the outside and lightly golden brown make up light and golden brown may not be that's crispy though so I'm saying I had to serve it whoops a little sriracha I'm telling you this stuff my obsession I let it sit here for about five minutes and this has my name written all over it let's go [Music] that is the answer to die in my chicken fried chicken is it it is that is I'm too excited to even talk
