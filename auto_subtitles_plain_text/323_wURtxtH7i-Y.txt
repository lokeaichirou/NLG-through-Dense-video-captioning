 colcannon is a classic Irish dish and a must-have for any st. Patrick's Day celebration and the great thing about it is that it is so easy to make traditionally it only has two ingredients potatoes of course and your choice of either kale or cabbage let's get started you're going to put about 2 pounds of field cubed potatoes into a saucepan submerge the potatoes with water and then bring to a boil bring the heat down to medium and then let them sit for about 15 minutes or until tender and while it's happening let's prep our veggie i'm using kale but feel free to experiment here you can use cabbage Swiss chard spinach pretty much any leafy green vegetable that you want whatever you use you can want to have about a pound of it and you're going to have it chopped keep in mind that if you are using kale you're gonna want to remove the steps you want just the leaves here and once that's chopped we transfer it to a pot of boiling salted water for blanching we're going to let that boil for about five minutes to make sure that the kale gets nice and tender again if you'd like to have a little bit more flavor feel free to add some veggies here I sometimes sir want some green onion a little bit of parsley maybe some leeks I'm just showing you the basic recipe here now what's T kayla has been blanched we're going to turn off the heat and then remove the keel from the water with a slotted spoon from here you have a couple options you can either put the kale into the potatoes as is or you can do what I like to do which is puree it's a little bit of butter now the choice of course is entirely up to you but I find that purane it allows it to mix in more evenly with potatoes speaking of which those still have a few minutes left another cook so I'm gonna go ahead and do that dubstep butter that is room temperature if you take it straight out of the fridge it will take longer to blend good perfect time and potatoes are fully cooked which means that we're going want to get these drained and dry out the pan nobody likes water dunkle cannon once everything is as dry as possible you're going want to return the potatoes to the pots and add the kale if you'd like a creamier consistency add a little butter and milk to the mix season with salt and pepper to taste and start mashing and there you have it colcannon a quick easy and incredibly versatile dish you can use this as a side or if you feel so inclined incorporate it into your banners mesh or shepherd's pie recipes well that's all from me today from metc storm watch this is daniel fisher wishing you happy cooking and a very happy st.
