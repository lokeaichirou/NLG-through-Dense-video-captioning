 hello I'm chef Diane DiMeo and welcome to bootleg tips today we are making something very fun generally this is something that you would brine but we are doing it a very fast quick and easy way and what is that sauerkraut it's a pickle and generally it's based upon putting something in some salt and water and letting it ferment however we don't always have that time and we really want a good not store-bought sauerkraut that we can make easily at home to match with anything for instance maybe a Reuben so make sure to check out my recipe for a Reuben but this cabbage cider vinegar salt a little brown sugar some mustard seed I like the ground and parts better flavor and I just don't really like the crunchy seeds and some oil to saute it in alright so first what I'm going to do and you want to make sure that you get it really thin when cabbage finely cooks it wilts down contains a lot of water voila and that's it now I'm going to go straight to the soap saute it and add all of my other ingredients so we're gonna have super delicious fabulous sauerkraut my pot is already nice and hot I'm gonna get my oil in there that's a tad bit we don't want oily oily sauerkraut we just want cook sauerkraut little oil goes a long way in a hot pan and let's see is it ba-baby and it goes first I'm going to let it wilt a little bit and then once it does I'm going to add some vinegar let it reduce add my sugar my mustard seed and a little bit of salt cook it down and that's about it we do my first energy reduction I'm not adding my seasonings now why because each time the vinegar reduces it either makes it a little too much concentrated or it might not be enough so once I had the cabbage at the right texture that I like I will then add my seasonings because it would be perfect and ready to go okay second vinegar reduction I'm going to wilt this about thirty percent more and then I'm gonna be ready to add the rest of my seasonings my kraut is at the texture that I want it to be a little crunchy still but definitely saw a lot of liquid has been evaporated and I'm going to go ahead and add my salt approximately I don't know one tablespoon some ground mustard seed about a half a teaspoon and sugar should I share this okay brown sugar in got two lovely tablespoons yes sir and by the way that was about I'd say well you have a half a cabbage head more this muscle meals and as always taste to adjust your seasoning but your feeling for fanti mmm that's some sauerkraut and this has been your tip for the week and I will see you next week with another bootleg tip hello I'm chef Diane DiMeo and welcome to my kitchen today we are making a corned beef
