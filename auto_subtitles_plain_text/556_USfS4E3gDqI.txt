 hey everyone chef Jason Hill here and my wife finally perfected her hummus recipe and I've been wanting to make a video on it for a while now so we're gonna do it this goes really good on sandwich spread you can put it in your wraps or just set it out as a dip with your favorite chips so let's get started first we're going to start with two 15 ounce cans of garbanzo beans also known as chickpeas that we drained and if you want a real creamy texture to your hummus you can take the time and remove the paper thin outer layer of the bean that that's a lot of work I've got a pretty powerful blender so I'm just going to let it chop that up okay while our beans are draining we're going to get together the rest of our ingredients you need four lemons we need the juice from them catch the seeds you don't want the seeds in there now we're going to take two large jalapenos cut off the top cut them lengthwise down the middle and I just use a little melon baller to scrape out the seeds and leave the seeds in if you like but we scrape them out and it's not quite as spicy that way all right I put together the last few ingredients and now it's time to blend and check this out I am coming out of 1992 and retiring this austere Iser blender that we've had forever and getting with the modern blending times I now have a Blendtec designer 725 this thing there is no comparison to a regular blender so if you do a lot of blending smoothies whatever it's worth the investment in this thing since I'm making a larger batch of the hummus I'm going to use my Wildside jar but I also have the twister jar if you want to half this recipe and you have that jar with the Blendtec I recommend that one and from some of the research I've done when you're blending you want to start with your liquid ingredients first so there's our juice of four lemons followed by four tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil next two tablespoons of tahini which is a paste of sesame seeds next I'm going to add a teaspoon of my garlic shallot puree or if you don't have that just use two cloves of garlic next we're going to throw in a healthy tablespoon of ground cumin followed by a teaspoon of kosher or sea salt and then our chickpeas or garbanzo beans a weird name like chickpeas has a weird chick in it okay if you want you can stop right here blend this up for a traditional hummus but since my wife likes her spicy versions of things we're going to take it to the next level and put in our jalapenos and then last is a cup of rinsed cilantro leaves to thin out the hummus and make it a little more creamy you may need to add a little water during the blending process so I'm going to put in about a half a cup let's put our lid on nice and tight and let's let the Blendtec do its magic okay we're going to turn the power on check out this cool digital display feature you have a few choices there I'm going to go with the dip which is this one right here okay let's get ready to rock and roll it smells well there you have it homemade hummus one little tip if you're going to serve this make it that day ahead of time let it sit the refrigerator overnight all the flavors will blend together better let's try it mmm man that's good good job camera lady give it a try guys mmm I could eat this whole thing for more simple and delicious recipes click on these links and please don't forget to Like share and subscribe
