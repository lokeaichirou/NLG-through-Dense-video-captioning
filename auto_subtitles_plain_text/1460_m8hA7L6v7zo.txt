 ghetto guys and welcome to Ossie gorilla now a couple months ago I did a video on how to make barbecued hash browns and since then I've had a few requests on how to make the fast food style hash browns so here they are alright guys you will need four potatoes which has been parboiled just until they start to soften and then dice them up into small cubes like this 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of sugar about 1/8 of a teaspoon of black pepper 1/3 of a cup of flour and 2 tablespoons of skim milk powder a teaspoon of softened butter and one beaten egg just add all the ingredients to the bowl now I'm just going to roughly mix it together and then I'm gonna gently mash it with the back of the spoon now we're not looking for a smooth paste here guys you still need quite a bit of texture from the potato in this mix now I'm gonna put it into the freezer for a half-hour just to stiffen it up a bit and then I'm going to spread it out between two sheets of baking paper and very gently roll it out and don't use too much pressure here guys because the mixture is very soft now just roll it out until it's about a quarter of an inch thick we've got something like this guys and now put it into your freezer until it is frozen solid once it's frozen just cut it into any shape you want guys as you can see here I'm using the traditional hashbrown shape but you can make it any shape you want it's very easy to cut in the shapes when it's frozen now simply put it into some hot oil and I'm gonna cook this for about two minutes and then take it out on tool rack so all the excess oil can drip off now just repeat this process until you've done all of your hashbrowns and once they're cool I'm gonna put them back in for about another thirty seconds or so now this step is very important this is what gives you that crunch that you're looking for and there you have it guys very very easy but absolutely awesome give it a go thanks for tuning in and I'll catch you guys next time
