 [Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with colcannon that's right colcannon named of course after the famous weapon used by the leprechauns to defeat the Vikings that built Stonehenge in the famous Second Battle of Blarney Castle and of course I'm just kidding everybody knows it was the Third Battle of Blarney Castle anyway it's an amazingly delicious potato dish and very traditional for st. Patrick's Day and here is how you put it together so we're gonna put our potatoes on to boil I have russet potatoes i quartered we want to boil those in salted water until perfectly tender and while those are simmering I'm gonna go ahead and prep my greens so I'm gonna use a big old handful of kale it's about four or five ounces all right my market sells it already chopped up in bags so all I need to do is sort of peel off those bigger stems I just want the leaves all right you can also use Swiss chard you can use cabbage you could use a lot of things okay so my Cal is prepped I'm also gonna chop up a leek now you can do this with just green onions but I really do enjoy leeks so I'm gonna have those and slice them across and I'm gonna stick with the white and light green parts see those dark green parts those can be very very fibrous and tough all right so you don't want to use too much of that especially since this is not gonna cook very long all right we're just gonna give these a quick blanch and of course those need to be rinsed really well leeks sometimes have a lot of sand in them I'm gonna add that to the kale and lastly I'm gonna chop up a bunch of green onions and by the way save a little bit to garnish the top later so I'm gonna toss those in a blender I'm gonna go ahead and blanch the kale and leeks and boiling salted water so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna bring the water to a boil dump in the vegetables give it a good mix this is on high heat of course when that comes back to a boil we're gonna cook that for about five to six minutes all right the vegetables are gonna stay green but they're just gonna tenderize slightly and remember we're gonna grind this down in the blender anyway alright so again mine came back to a boil boiled for five minutes I fished it out with my strainer all right so we're gonna toss that into a blender and puree it with some butter and you know the drill just keep pulsing it on and off on and off you're gonna have to really use your spatula to scrape it down alright there's not a lot of liquid in here which is good there's nothing worse than watery colcannon and yes we're both thinking the same thing he forgot to put in the butt I did so I put it in right here all right and another tip besides put it in at the same time as the Greens use room-temperature butter my butter was cold and rock-hard so it was really hard to puree in here so this took me like three or four minutes if your butter soft this is only gonna taking a minute anyway regardless puree that in a blender until fairly fine and reserve until needed all right theoretically by this point your potatoes are cooked you're gonna drain them extremely well put them back into the dry pot mash them with a little bit of butter but not all the way all right just to get it started because what we're gonna do we're gonna add our green stuff and we're gonna mash that in and you're gonna see as soon as you start mashing that Cal and leek and onion mixture in the color just turns into this incredibly beautiful shade of green is it clover green is it emerald green is it Boston Celtic green I don't know it reminds me of spraying and it makes me happy all right we're almost done here I'm gonna go ahead and season this with some salt and pepper to taste what about cayenne how do you use any do they use cayenne in Ireland all right somebody report back to me on that and then last but not least if you want to put in just a little small splash of cream or milk or you know what I wish I had homemade creme fraiche but a little touch of dairy here at the end lightens it up and that is done all right I'm gonna spoon that into an Irish style bowl and I think it's actually a law you must garnish your colcannon with butter that's right more butter on top it's gonna melt into those steaming hot potatoes and it's gonna make it basically irresistible I'm gonna finish with some fresh green onion and that is by far my favorite traditional st. Patrick's Day food all right let's Riverdance this fork into that pile of buttery goodness and some recipes I just don't even need to explain how good that's going to be all right those comforting buttery potatoes that beautiful earthy green kale all right the slight pungency from the onion and the leek just a perfect perfect springtime treat and one I hope you try for your st.
