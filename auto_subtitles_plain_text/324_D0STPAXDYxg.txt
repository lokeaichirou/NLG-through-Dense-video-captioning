 we make over 75 Indian recipes and I think it's about time that I show you how to make the most famous Indian snacks the most famous Indian appetizer veggie samosas yes I'm going to show you how to make ready samosas today now in India it's not common for people to make samosas at home because there are sweet shops in every corner and you can get some more cells everywhere but here in North America it's a delicacy it's like a special occasion that you're making samosas and I make good samosas but we all know that mom samosas are the best so today I have my mom here and she's going to make some authentic veggie samosas so let's get started all right here we have one and a half cup of all-purpose flour in which we are adding 1/4 cup of oil and we are also going to add 1 teaspoon of salt and now we are going to mix everything with water and make a dough out of it so we're just mixing everything adding water and making a dough now a lot of time people use phyllo pastries shell to make samosas but that's not the right way you can use it once in a while but authentic samosas are made out of method that is all-purpose flour so you will find that people use a machine dough making machine you can use that if you want that when you make it with hand that tastes the best so make sure it's soft so one foot cup of oil 1 and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and this is going to be good for like 1820 simul cells but you need it's the software it's going to be and so much better will be your small cells when it comes to the taste so just need and get for like good 5 6 minutes making it really really soft so it's almost ready just and we'll start working on our stuffing boiling our potatoes we have about nine potatoes here if it should be good for about 20 samosas even more depending on how much you use a person 'moosa for the filling and then we'll peel them off mash them cleanup potatoes here getting them ready for our stuffing then I'm going to chop some onions some cilantro we'll add in some spices and have a beautiful mixture beautiful stuffing that will go in our samosas stuffing here I have my potatoes ready you can cut them in small pieces as well I've kind of mashed them with the hand and here we have dry coriander which we have crushed again so about one large tablespoon and the other things that we are going to add in our stuffy include onions so one large onion chopped finely 1 tablespoon of ginger cilantro about 1/4 of a cup finely chopped and green chilies now I'm making these samosas for some friends so I'm not going to add green chillies but if you want you can go ahead and add that so here in our big wok in a big karahi we have lots of oil and this is what you use to deep-fry your samosa so it's heating up here and we are going to fry our stuffing here so first of all in our pan we've added a little bit of oil so about 2 tablespoons and we've added our coriander frying our dry coriander which we have crushed and we'll go ahead and add onions and we'll also add our ginger these things are going to keep it super simple we are just going to add salt and red powder that's adding our souls about 2 teaspoons maybe a little bit more about 3 teaspoons depends on how much stuffing you have pinch of garam masala gonna have a little bit of red chili powder just adding our potatoes in our pan frying them a little bit you can also use other vegetables if you want in your stuffing like peas or maybe a little bit of cauliflower really really finely grated and green chilies just for the extra heat and if you want you can use ground chicken or beef or whatever to make your samosas after your choice cause our best enjoyed with like tamarind chutney or like mint chutney if you don't have those ketchup is the best within a couple of minutes your potatoes will be ready we'll go ahead and add cilantro that we have chopped and stuffing on the side after mixing everything well together and then we'll start working on our pastry on our outer shell here we are making the outer shell so taking a little ball of dough and almost like you would make a roti you will flatten it out thinner it is better your samosas will be so just thinning it out look at that that's going to be a perfect night she'll see how thin it is does take a little practice to get perfect samosas so we've cut it into half stuff so now we are going to stuff our pastry so just fold it like you would make a little cone out of it in a triangular shape you know this again yeah so we're gonna just fill it up and seal it pastry shell with our stuffing unlocking the door so one nice samosa is done we're just gonna fry it filling our second samosa small ball and flattening it out almost like you'll make a routine and that's the hardest part getting like a nice thin outer shell cutting it in half making a triangular pocket so just see once again the technical part of making the outer shell with your hand press a little bit the outer shell so that you can have a nice triangular pocket fill it up with your stuffing whatever you may be using and simply close the sides and press it a little bit if you don't press it down it will open when you are frying it so that that are beautiful too many samosas are ready they are raw so you have to deep fry them you can use your good old deep fryer or you can do it the old a sieve a deep frying them in a karahi or in your wok make sure the oil is really really hot otherwise you will be frying it forever alright so just putting our beauty samosas in the hot oil and we let them fry up and they are nice brown crispy will turn them getting all sides nice and brown give them a couple of minutes let them get nice and brown tied once it's brown so that the motors are done nicely from every side you once they're nice and round you give them out you can even line your dish with some brown paper to soak the extra oil out just putting our next batch in how beautiful samosas are coming along so go ahead feel free to serve them with Emily ki chutni that's tamarind sauce with mint chutney or good old ketchup
