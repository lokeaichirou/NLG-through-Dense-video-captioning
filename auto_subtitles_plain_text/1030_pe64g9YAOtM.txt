 [Music] hello namaste Salam alikoum sorry Cal welcome back to another session with your washer at whatever calm today we are going to take one more journey with this Chinese quizzing but this dish you will not find in China or even in India this dish is very popular in United States today we are going to make general salt chicken see I can't even pronounce it right it is T as so I don't know what they call but we will cook this this perfect so to make this sauce is very easy all you need to do is just take one cup of stock to this stock add around two tablespoons of soy sauce and one tablespoon of hoisin sauce around one tablespoon of sugar two tablespoons of rice vinegar and the pinch of pepper just mix all these ingredients in this particular preparation we add more of sugar and the consistency of the sauce should be like honey okay first we will go ahead and make a batter in which we are going to dip this chicken and fry it's very easy add few drops of soy sauce well bit of egg white just take a whisk and whisk it to this add around the half a cup of form con la and mix it nicely and bring it to a nice batter consistency now this um this egg and soy sauce mixture is ready all you do is add your chicken to that and mix it nice now if your batter is too thin what you can do is you can add a little bit of all-purpose flour you can take the chicken and start fine this method of data frame is much easier but some people also use another method what they do is they take constant separately and their eggs separately they dip the chicken in the cornstarch and then in the egg and then again on the constructs they do that thinking that if you give a double coating of the flour but when you do that method your chicken will not get the color and you will give white raises all over so I always follow this method whichever one you feel coming in for you you can go ahead and follow that method and one more thing is you should fry this chicken in a medium heat so that they get nicely cooked and you get a nice color do not fry it in a hot flame where the chicken is not cooked inside okay now General Tso's chicken all you do is add some sesame seed oil and little bit of red chili whole these optional ingredients if you want to use it you can add it add a little bit of chopped garlic add a little bit chopped ginger also this had your chicken and add the mixture what you kept ready for your general sauce if you want more sauce you can add a little bit of this mission if not you want it dry like the restaurants time you can add a little less and bring it to a nice ball once the chicken absorbs little bit of the juice make a small well add a little bit of corn starch wow look at this look at this how easy and simple it is to make General Tso's chicken garnish it a little bit of spring onion Wow look at it small so dear friends what do you think is in general sauce chicken very easy the most important thing is if you want to add a little bit of chilli sauce into your sauce you can add it and make it as spicy as you want so I hope you have enjoyed to learn General Tso's chicken with your wash up at Whatcom but remember whatever is all about inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes and cooking tips so others can benefit from [Music]
