 hey thanks for turning into the smoke conflate cuisine channel my name is Sean and today I'm going to be making classic buffalo wings these buffalo wings is a hit trust believe when I say they all right hit every cookout I throw they're the first ones to go any family gather we get together they are the first ones to go they are the bomb they're mouth-watering and you're gonna be able smelling straight through the camera coming to the kitchen with me I'm not to show you how to make these means I'm putting on my apron because right now real jazzed up and I want to get any hot sauce on my clothes and stain my clothes even though it's OxiClean and all types of products out here I rather just uh keep it nice and neat so that's what my aprons for so come on in and let's I'm going to tell you about the products I'm using today I am using some coarse kosher salt by Morton it's just sprinkle on chicken and I'm just going to use a little bit and some black pepper going to season the chicken with some Lowery's season sod some Frank's redhot this is the classic seasoning and sauce to put on your hot wings your buffalo wings I might call it both because that's what they were known for both hot wings ake a buffalo wings so I have some garlic powder ran out the Kroger's got some garlic powder and some onion powder I got some Caribbean tradition a great with the by grace chicken seasoning but also seasoned with that and I have some unsalted butter so would that be si I like to use our salted butter I like the taste of it better than salted butter and if you would like to sort the butter you can put some salt and all you can just use substituted for salted butter okay I did wash my chicken my rested and vinegar and also in the course that I'm using a kosher salt and I put it on a paper towel to drain the excess water off of the chicken so right now I'm just going to take the paper towel out from the chicken and I'm going to season the chicken as well so you sprinkle just a little bit to people that are accustomed to cooking and seasoning chicken you know you can probably put like a half a teaspoon teaspoon of seasoned on it and then also now have the garlic powder I'm going to open the garlic powder and put some sprinkles on the chicken sprinkle by the teaspoon this you definitely want your seasoned salt next I have the chicken seasoning you can you can find this on the International Isles I'm just going to drop a little bit of coarse salt on it not as much you know I don't want my chicken to be salty so um just going to sprinkle just a pinch that's it you can marinate your chicken overnight you don't you know you definitely the seasons will set in more you can marinate for a couple of hours maybe about two to four hours and the in a figurative you have some time or you know for the busy people out there if you don't have time and you really want to get these things done just just season it real well and it'll be just as good ok did want to tell you guys that I did add some extra virgin olive oil and I'm going to sprinkle it over the chicken right before I put it in the oven this is a mixto chicken brown and I usually tend to use this rather than like use water because it cooks the chicken fast and chicken uh every change with a lot of water so it usually once it starts cooking down it has his own water and you know it it becomes perfect either or either way you want to use it you can use that you can add water or not but I choose not to and I just add a little bit of olive oil it comes out her feet okay I did set my oven to 400 and just slid the wings right in there in gonna let them cook have a half a stick of butter unsalted butter remember I am using unsalted butter butter the recipe so I like to melt this butter in a pot and once that melts down one just add the hot sauce okay I just melted a half a stick of the unsalted butter and now I'm going to pour in the hot sauce I want to just use the whole bottle and this is a 12 ounce 12 ounce right hot first step once this gets hot then I'm going to add the the wings in and then I'm just going to smuggle the wings in the sauce you know get it on all sides and then you want to bake it for another possibly 10 to 15 minutes and they will be done okay now that this sauce is hot you're going to add in the wings Adam and won by like usual I'm going to use my hands but you can use a fork but I'm going to use my hands and like I said I get down and dirty stuff spread them out let the wing simmer for about five minutes in the sauce and then you're going to add them to the pan remember to taste your sauce the more spicier the less butter more butter less spicy and I'm ready to add them add the waist of the pant I just put the wings back in the oven for another 15 minutes or so 10 to 15 minutes give or take and then they'll be done just can't help it I'm gonna wash it down well close until see their sugar Rita cold froze them the best all right oh yeah I get the cooking so you see what I'm having see y'all what's your definition of an independent woman woman is somebody could be bad or bottoms up doesn't have to rely on business my future depends on me you can leave them anyone be no deal because you can still do everything you're doing before then I think that a lot of women thinks that me it's not needing any money I think it means the opposite I don't think a woman should define goes out independent you'll have to remind him this one is way me it's not the dollar when it comes to big ship he comes down to the ambitions of your pants and if it's about a partnership then really less than that so that's what she says you know person who's the money said if I look at them as a prostitute to labels the prostitute commander you a slave the cash I always like a double standard for a man to be a little cocky with his when a woman she can't she have to be extremely humbleness she got the money I don't think that's fair righto I don't really gravitate towards the hole deeper meaning I grab a change to it she's definitely an independent woman if you have ego then you must go wrong with that why can't we have a powerful you have you know a married woman can say yes I could be independent academic easy and I don't you got choose not to take your myself Oh you know man you know to me I think he should be in with this I mean she's independent she she would be able to sustain about certain level stability cost a little without I had to doubt the Fed of women is kind of tricky the like I hear that I might end up in a moment I get stuck up more as the years roll they're losing their feminine side they go into the room being a man to find somebody in to find love you have to be willing to accept the person for who they are if you're in economy if he's not thinking that you could have to be admitted in Norfolk you probably we need to create a way for these relationships work and you know people have expectations women say I'm working towards my most relationships saying what the angle instead of what the car gonna do I want to am I gonna clean out well you know what I work so that'll mean it your car's your carburetor phone on phone speaks ACOG I see you gotta cut the yard and hit vertical breaking and I see you guys looking to bring the burglar and I work we want equality which is what we say we wanna be a man what a man and then but having a man role we're we're looked at as it were probably you checked it we try to use we have negative factor always down necessarily control about her man put it she can think you can support him the way she needed to she wants a great man of her life but you know what she's not going to go down hill go chase someone defend themselves and their thoughts and their ideas because attractive thing about a woman or a man is relate to say confidently well they are whether it fits the norm or not to me that independence such thing is an independent woman because we're all dependent upon each other you
