 fattoush salad is a Levantine salad made from toasted or fried pieces of pita bread and a variety of ingredients by Levantine that usually consists of Egypt Jordan Lebanon Palestine Israel Syria and parts of southern Turkey now I want to cut the heart of a rota romaine lettuce into fairly small pieces I throughout the park it usually goes on a ham stop our ham sandwich and I'm shutting this into fairly small pieces not cutting it as small as you would with you making boom and I'm sure you pick up this a bully so the desmics like the limit of what I'm going to get out of this heart of Romania in addition for the romaine lettuce cucumber green pepper so the suggestion for the recipe was green pepper and red pepper but red peppers so incredibly expensive than I refuse to use it chopped parsley chopped fairly fine small chopped onion chopped green onion and finely chopped myth about two tablespoons I'm also using tomato and since I live in America and it's impossible to get fresh tasty tomatoes i'm using i'm using canned tomato which has been through throughout the tomato juice and actually rinsed the pieces of tomatoes so that the tomato juice wouldn't interfere with the dressing that i'm going to make so i had two tomatoes and because somebody was kind enough to leave a little bit of a cheese i'm going to add that to this is the part that really looking forward to I'm gonna mix it up there it is looks pretty good to me now for the dressing I'm going to be a little bit daring because let's face it i don't know much about making dressing and I want to have enough so that I don't have to make make any more before the salad is going so I'm going to put in what I think is about the juice of three lemons maybe four maybe four then let's see what next I think I probably within a teaspoon or two of garlic then I'm going to add some regular mustard perhaps teaspoon of black pepper a little bit of white pepper too I get in between the black pepper and I have a sense from reading several recipes there should be some sweetness i'm going to try a little bit maple syrup but not very much because there's no disguising maple syrup if you get too much in much there but if it is I'll probably add and the rest would probably be extra virgin olive oil put it into this clean jars that looks pretty good one of the best things about this salad aside from the obvious health benefits is that sir pita chips which could be homemade but I'm way to do that I need to shake this dressing up a little bit so here it is that touch√© salad with mustard and maple syrup dressing which is my favorite part not homemade but extremely interesting
