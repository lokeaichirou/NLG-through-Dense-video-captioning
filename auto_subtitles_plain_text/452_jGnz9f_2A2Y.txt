 hi I'm John quilter and I love bringing music and food together and today I'm with Newton falconer hello i'm genesis this is my house i am in the middle of making my fourth album and what we decided to do is open up the whole process to four webcams which have been broadcasting everything we're gonna do this amazing dish which we've got these Madagascan balls my touch you can even get to know them a piece of you spray so we've got we've got a shrimp we're going to do a really cool um seaweed and chilli garnish and then a great difference so you've got this back boy here and what we're gonna do is we need to take the outer skin on so just get in here and you just kind of pry it apart along here and then you're just peeling it over and now what we're gonna do is that we're just gonna cook down the back top yes okay Matt that's sort of like you don't want to eat that it's not very flavorful and then you see how it kind of just and got the flying again so I've just opened them up like that okay cool now what I'm gonna do is going to make a tempura batter it's super simple really quick I think it's one of those dishes that you want to learn how to do because you can do it with vegetables you can do it with fish you can do it with me really awesome then we've got some self raising flour then we've got some corn flour and now we're going to use a sparkling mineral water you could use solar water but the important thing is is that it's cold it's really important that you do that the consistency we're looking for is that you want to whisk everything in basically all those bubbles that are going there are kind of lifting it and that's gonna make it really light so it's important to whisk all the flour together and get a nice consistency that when you put your finger in just coat you don't want any lumps in there see how it's just coating my finger perfect you want it to be like you've seen yourself pretty high-level with this this new album you've literally done it in more four weeks is that right yeah we go we gave ourselves five weeks to get finished and this whole the way that we've done at this process is that you've never been done before so at no point in music does anyone kind of opened up the recording process to quite this degree but the cameras are on all the time so they're on all day and all night when I was worried about the kind of things I was like well hell is it more exciting to get an album and hear it for the very first time or to have heard it being made and then hear the finished product and its really unique isn't it that's really interesting okay so we've done the prawns we've got the banner done now we're gonna get this really cool season for the salt part we're gonna use see ways if you can just start pounding that down and then what I'm gonna do is I've got these great Mexican chili you do really smoky and so I'm just gonna chop this down a little bit now remember if you don't want the heat leave these seeds out that's where the fire is up I want a bit of fire and then what I'm gonna do to add to that is I'm just gonna put in here just there we go perfect that's delicious as it is but then we want a really cool dipping sauce and I love this different sauce and sweet chili dipping sauce get that bad boy in there and then the next one do you want to put there is the the vinegar Park the sour so in she goes and then we've got some fish sauce a squirt of her I've toasted up some sesame seeds they're going in and then this is she's gonna make it really vibrant really Cindy really fresh so we're just gonna get some coriander and we're gonna get some mint you could use other fresh vibrant herbs like dill or parsley I'm just gonna blitz that so now that that's done we're just gonna get it just go sieve it through so we just got the little bit because the big one that overpower it okay so perfect we're ready to start frying it so and then just get the bad boys you can take the heads off if you want to I'm just going to put those in make sure that they're all covered you can still see the prawn underneath it so it's light and then you hold it for a little bit as if you just drop it straight in it'll sink to the bottom stick to the basket and you'll deliver you'll kill somebody right Danny but I can't do this anymore now they're gonna cook for about a minute and a half two minutes tops a hundred and ninety degrees and you're just going to see them turn a beautiful pink and then the bats gonna be a beautiful golden color they're gonna flip in taste worthy to the max people and then a little thing that just adds to the season in which is just going to take it up a little bit but it's gonna add so much he's a little bit of lemon we just put a little bit in without season okay so trade off we'll just punch it and then into the seasoning they go for the hop so they're gonna pick up that beautiful seaweed and the chilli and just whack them on here and then we're just gonna finish off with a nice wedge that boy there and then we have the most amazing tempura shrimp with seaweed and pepper seasoning and a really cool sweet-and-sour differences first let's just get a bite and then now
