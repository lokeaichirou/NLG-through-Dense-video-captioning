 ha ha ha hi oops our quality oh hi I've been started from master chef season 2 and I didn't see you there today is st. Patty's Day and I'm going to teach you how to make cold Kalin okay that's added a lot worse than it did in my head I'm thinking of it I apologize I can't do an Irish accent where the crap but in fact today is st. Patrick's Day a lot of people don't realize that st. Patrick's Day is actually an Irish American holidays they don't celebrate it in Ireland the way that we do here and in fact I'm sorry to tell you this Boston but Australia st. Patrick's Day puts our st. Patrick's Day absolutely to shame at any rate today is the day when I try to prepare as many of my favourite authentic Irish treats as possible and in my household that means colcannon cole ken is a traditional Irish dish that's made with kale and potatoes and it's traditionally eaten with some type of pork today I'm going to teach you the way I do kokkonen which I substitute purple cabbage for kale and I add all sorts of bacon and delicious pork fat into the mix it's going to be absolutely delicious ok let's get started first step I've got two and a half pounds of russet potatoes that have been sliced about that thick maybe about an inch or so they are unpeeled and I'd like to do that because the peel adds extra flavor and texture and also increases the nutrition of the recipe two and a half pounds is about eight medium sized potatoes now I'm going to put them into my pressure cooker along with about five cloves of garlic chopped up and a cup of water now if you don't have a pressure cooker don't worry you can cook your potatoes anyway all you're doing at this point is making garlic mashed potatoes so you can cook them with a microwave you can boil them you can steam them you can roast them however you want to do that to me mashed potatoes I just like to do it in my pressure cooker because it takes eight to the minutes which is very fast and it also retains a lot more of the nutrition next step bacon now in Ireland this was probably made more frequently with the cheaper cuts of the pig basic pork belly pork jowl hocks smoked hocks and things like that now pork belly is probably the best meat to get for kokkonen in my opinion I couldn't find any at the grocery store they were all out so I just grabbed some of the center cut bacon it's got a little bit less fat in it a little bit more lean so it's going to be a big meteor and I'm going to render all of that fat out and get the visib a and crispy now that I've chopped it up here my cast iron skillet I love cooking with cast iron if you have learned this from my other videos throw away your non-stick pans you cannot cook good on nonstick pan catamarans was invented centuries ago it is still the best form of cooking pan available known to mankind and it always will be it's cheap it only requires a little bit more maintenance and care than regular non-stick pans so go get yourself some useful into this rift store and start improving your cooking today now once I make it as cooking I'm gonna chop up ahead red cabbage now you don't have to wash cabbage just remove the outer cut more free layers of leaves and discard them and you're good to go I like to use red cabbage over the traditional kale in this recipe first of all because the color I really love that beautiful red color and also because it has a little bit crunchy or meteor texture and I would like a cold Hannah that's got lots of the you're running through it letting this thicken with nice and crispy go ahead and pull it out to the slotted spoon don't reserve that fat eight minutes in the pressure cooker and my potatoes are nice and tender s so fast so now I'm going to mash them with a stick of butter and about half a cup of heavy cream now we're not mashed potatoes you'll see I'm actually using a masher for several years I put them into my KitchenAid and I whipped them to them until they were light and fluffy but what I discovered after working on MasterChef is that the texture of mashed potatoes when you whip them and overwork them becomes kind of gooey and sticky and that was accustomed to that being the texture I should expect but it turns out that when you just lightly mash them you get a much fluffier light texture to them so use just a masher or a fork if you've got the potato ricer which is like a giant garlic press that presses them out that gives you the best texture of all but don't get in there with your immersion blender our part or your hand mixer or put them in your stand mixer because it is going to absolutely ruin the beautiful fluffy texture of those potatoes and now I have a bowl of beautiful fluffy mashed potatoes this is the time to season them with salt and pepper the bacon fat now how much makes up a lot of space to fill your skillet but 80% of cabbages water and air and all of those will air pockets inside the cabbage are going to collapse and so this is going to reduce by half fairly quickly then give yourself a little bit of salt to the cabbage while that's cooking and a splash of vinegar I'm just going to use apple cider vinegar right now vinegar goes really well with cabbage you really do not want to over cook the cabbage though little bit cooks cabbage tastes disgusting it tastes like a dead skunk and you really don't want to be eating dead skunk put it there I don't think so you're just going to cook it until the point that it's wilted and still has some good crunch to it and that is as far as you're going to take it now when your cabbage is slightly cooked but still crispy you can add it to your potatoes along with a bunch of chopped scallions or green onions and all that delicious bacon you cooked earlier stir that together and you've got Cola cannon isn't that beautiful all those wonderful colors and textures it's like a potato salad on steroids and that is how you make my version of the classic Irish dish that is a good plate of food you can serve a big ol helping of this as the main and only course and you can serve it as a side dish to some grouse sausages or something yummy like that a pork roast mmm great crunchy bacon crunchy cabbage fresh bite from those green onions that's fantastic for the full recipe hit my website Ben Starcom thanks for watching have a great st. Patrick's Day you
