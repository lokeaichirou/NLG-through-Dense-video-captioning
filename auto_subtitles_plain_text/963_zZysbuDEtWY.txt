 eggs benedict seems like a complicated and fancy dish to pull off it's really just a plate of saucy eggs ham and toast all the parts can be made ahead and put together right before you serve it including a quick version of hollandaise sauce that I make in a blender start the hollandaise sauce by filling a large saucepan about half way full with water and bringing it to a simmer over high heat then turn it off and set it aside you're gonna use this to keep the sauce warm the classic way to make hollandaise sauce is to whisk egg yolks and lemon juice over double boiler and then slowly add in melted butter but the problem with this is that you can end up scrambling your eggs or if you add the butter too fast you can break your sauce but I have a foolproof way of making the same sauce with a lot less hassle guide your blender and add 2 egg yolks and 1 tbsp lemon juice blend it on medium speed for about 30 seconds or until it's lightened in color then reduce the speed to low take out the small cap from the lid and slowly drizzle in 8 tablespoons of melted butter turn off the blender add half a teaspoon of kosher salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper and pulse to combine then boom and the sauce is done just stick it on hot water to stay warm for later now get ready to poach the eggs grab a medium saucepan and fill it with about two quarts or at least two inches of water add four teaspoons of white vinegar and bring it to a simmer to successfully poach eggs you should make sure to do three things the first thing is make sure that your water is just barely at a simmer because if you have it boiling rapidly those big bubbles are just gonna rip your egg apart the second thing is you want to make sure not to skip adding the vinegar because the vinegar is there to help keep the egg whites together and the last thing is make sure to crack your egg into a little bowl or ramekin first because if you just plop it in there straight from the shell the yolk can break add four eggs to the water and cook without poking at them for about three minutes then use a slotted spoon to lift the eggs out you want the whites to be set and you can use your finger to check for firmness put them in a bowl of warm water and set them aside then split two English muffins toast them cope with a little butter and season with a little salt and pepper while the muffins are toasting warm up the ham the easiest way to do this is in the microwave but you can do in a frying pan as well the class kamme to use for an eggs benedict is Canadian bacon but I prefer thinly sliced ham because I don't like wrestling with that tough casing now you have all the parts ready put your muffin down and top it with some of the ham then get your slotted spoon lift the egg from the water and use a paper towel to absorb the excess water place the egg on the ham and drizzle with plenty of the hollandaise sauce if you want sprinkle with a little bit of paprika here you have a classic and elegant breakfast that you can serve for Sunday brunch or for Mother's Day you've got a crunchy muffin and salty ham and a perfectly poached gooey egg with lemony hollandaise sauce on top and that's it the easiest way to make Eggs Benedict [Music]
