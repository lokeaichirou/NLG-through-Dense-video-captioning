 chicken pot stickers are really fun to cook at home and I'm going to show you a couple tips that will help you avoid disaster when you're making your pot stickers the first thing that can happen is your pot stickers can explode in the pot and there they won't be delicious because they're just going to be watery mush so you have to make sure to seal it right first of all secondly I'm going to show you how to get a good sear on them so they don't stick to the bottom of the pan first thing we're going to do is put our pot sticker ingredients together so I'm taking my lemongrass here adding all of that in half of my ginger half of my garlic scallions hoisin sauce 1 spoon of that we'll save the rest for later a little sesame oil I'm going to mix this up a little salt and pepper so this is our potsticker mixture right here it's just that easy we'll just go ahead and lay out these dumpling wrappers we'll just take a little bit of this filling put it right in the middle of each one of these guys here a little bit over a teaspoon in each one of these remember when you're working with chicken you always want to clean your cutting board down afterwards and wash your hands really well rinse off my fingers so the first trick to making sure that you get a nice seal in your pot stickers and they're not exploding is I've got a bowl of water here and I've also got a fork so I'm going to take my fingers and I'm just going to wet them and go around the edge I'm going to fold it and crimp it with my fingers and get a really nice seal when you lay them out like this you have a methodology to how you're working you can actually do them pretty quick and to take it even a step further I'm going to take the fork I'm just going to go around the potstickers just like that they're really locked in there that's not going anywhere they all look good you've got a pot of boiling water going here already next up I'm just gonna double them straight into the boiling water bada bing bada boom while these are going I'm gonna let them cook for about another minute I'm turning my non-stick pan on this has been about three or four minutes in the boiling water add a little bit of oil for a pan here turn it up to high nice and hot we're gonna drain these guys out you want to be careful here because there's water and oil and I can splatter a little you're going to carefully put these in here in a single layer and we'll just let them go on one side so they're nice and crispy then we're going to flip them over see how nice those are we cook them a little bit before we put them in the pan here so that's going to be the key to making a nice crunchy pot sticker on the outside so we're going to give these about a minute and a half on each side all right so these have been going on one side for a couple minutes I'm just going to give them a quick flip they're getting done here perfect we can use a spatula for this too I like to use a fork because you can get under there we'll give it another minute on this side the secret right now is just to get a nice and crispy though these guys are done they're nice and crispy and delicious so I'm just going to take these and put them to the side on a plate and we're going to use the same pan still hot add a little bit more oil and then we're going to add the rest of our aromatics that we had which is the ginger and the garlic that we had set aside and these scallions classic ingredients and that just takes literally a couple seconds I already have a nice hot pan so adding our baby tatsoi straight into that salt pepper give it a quick toss that's all you need this is done add your pot stickers back in soy sauce our mirin and our hoisin toss it all together so let's plate it up and see how it tastes look at that it's a delicious beautiful tatsoi nice crispy potstickers just going to eat one of these out of here it's going to be hot and I'm very excited about it hmm taut but it's amazing it's delicious it's full of flavor they're nice and crispy and tick check it out not a single one opened up I have complete faith that you guys can make it at home send me your pictures I want to see them and enjoy this great food Thanks
