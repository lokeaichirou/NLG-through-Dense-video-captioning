 let's talk about what we're going to cook with in order to make pork fried rice the first and most important thing you're going to need is pork equally important to the pork fried rice process is rice now we need something to fry it I'm going to be using soybean oil because that's what I have access to and it's actually pretty good from here on out everything is strictly optional you can pick your own veggies you can pick fruit if you want you can mix and match all kinds of things and make it taste however you like stir fry and fried rice is very much your own choices whatever you want I chose ginger-garlic a red pepper a carrot and finally pickled yellow radish it's actually really good sort of sour sort of sweet sort of bitter alright guys that's all the stuff you need to make pork fried rice let's go ahead and get started this job is best suited for the GoPro so I'm actually going to stick with GoPro for the rest of the shots this is where all the action happens and this is where things are going to get really good first thing you want to do is take a little bit of oil just a splash you don't want very much all this goes for all food but stir-fry definitely the sooner you add something to the pot the less flavor it's going to have the less impact is going to have on the overall flavor you're still gonna be able to taste things it's just not going to be a strong so if you don't like garlic very much add the garlic first I have pre cut all of my vegetables and I'm going to go ahead and toss them here into the pan that was really fun actually I enjoyed that a lot guys when I said this is going to be easy I met in a very real way this is going to be very easy you want to be careful not to stop stirring because you should be running this at a very high heat and if you stop stirring you could end up with burns on the bottom of your food and you just don't want that also this helps to cook it evenly now if you're feeling really crazy and you want to get you know sort of awesome can do this thing and then spill it all over that was going really well until i looked at the camera alright so those are nice and warm so i'm going to go ahead and add the garlic now and i am having a fair bit of garlic and i'm doing that because we haven't really had spices for our food a ground dried out spice like you used to find in the bottles and or the jars in the state are not super common here so i had to buy a giant package garlic which i'm not opposed to I love garlic I had to buy ginger that I cut up myself you know things that are different in Korea one thing you really don't want is burnt garlic so after you add the garlic don't wait very long before you start adding other ingredients next up is the pork and I've also when I cook this earlier I put the ginger in with it so it would just so the flavors would combine a little bit I think it would be really good so there's been to set airtight for a while so all that air all the flavors from the ginger were able to mix in with the pork so I'm actually really excited about this so we're gonna go ahead and dump those in mmm I can smell the ginger in and out and it's just absolutely wonderful actually worked out really well I did much better at that time I'm coming back to my old friend the precooked single-serving rice container now this is something I didn't practice before and it is pretty dry it's definitely drier than I thought it was going to be so I'm going to make an audible call here I'm going to add a little bit of soy sauce here on the fly to help moisten up the rice a little bit know that your workstation is going to get dirty when you're doing stir-fries like it's just part of it and guys that's seriously it you just cut up your ingredients you put them in a walk and you stir it all together and over high heat and you have dinner so let's go ahead and put this on a plate and see what it looks like I decided to put it in bowls today and it's super simple just like the whole cooking process was just kind of nudged on out of there now one thing that you need to understand that some people miss last week when I cook this food I eat it this is for an actual meal that myself and my actual wife will be enjoying tonight that fit nicely into two bowls all its love to do is grab some spoons and dig in thanks for watching and Joel I look forward to your video
