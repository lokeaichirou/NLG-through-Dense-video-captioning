 hey everybody thanks for stopping in I think I'll give the toaster oven a rest today and cook some beer brats but I don't think I'll do them on my grill I think I was just doing on my stovetop so let's get started so here's what I have these Big Bang beer bratwursts New York style sausage company made in California so those nice fresh bratwurst and I'm just going to get those browning up and my cast iron skillet here and then we'll put some beer in there with those and while those are cooking I'm going to cut up some of this sweet onion these little sweet peppers they look like habanero peppers I should tell you they're habaneros then you'll think I'm tough and a neighbor brought over a couple little zucchinis so I'm going to put a zucchini in there too just to be different all right my bratwursts are browning up here and I got my peppers onions and zucchini cut up you're probably thinking who put zucchini on top of bratwurst well hey just thought it'd be different ok we'll flip these babies over they're getting kind of browned up maybe almost a little too Brown hard to cook and run the camera and do everything and not hit stuff over done once in a while so soon as those are a little more brown we'll add the beer to that and those are cooking at a low heat so we'll just let those saut√© okay we're looking good here I added a little bit of olive oil to the veggies from the socks taken now I'm just going to add a beer this is steel reserve I know a lot of people use German beer on these but steel reserves what I usually drink me and the homeless guys and I'll be sure that the pan is picked up when I'm done you you people will get that one alright just let those simmer a little bit I got to tell you guys these sure smell good simmering away in that beer they've been in there for about 20 minutes or so not quite as brown on the underside but uh wow they smell really good so I think my veggies are about done their thing called get one of these on a bun and give it a try man I cut into one of these to try it and juice squirted out all over the place almost burned myself so maybe I should have poked a few holes in them but they sure are good I've cooked bratwurst before but I don't think I've done it in beer like this but man it sure is good let me have a bite of this one here if I can do it without burning myself that really has a lot of flavor I don't think I've done them in beer before but I think I'm going to do them in beer again because they sure are good thanks for watching you guys and I'll talk to you next time
