 so I'm just going to prepare a really popular salad that's um a Mediterranean salad one we had fairly often at home this one is tabouli and don't forget subscribe underneath and leave a comment I'd love to hear your thoughts on it what we have here is all the ingredients we need for tabbouleh firstly the board up on wheat it's this is a fine bottle whole wheat and she could get the dark brown or the library and it doesn't really matter we have salt and pepper we'll need some spring onions or scallions they are fine to use or if you don't have those you could use half a brand onion we've got Tomatoes we might use two or perhaps three of those will see these aroma Tomatoes it doesn't matter again what kind of tomatoes but the red ones are good if you've got heirloom tomatoes that would be fine it really doesn't matter we've got some lemons for lemon juice parsley which we'll need big bunch of and some extra virgin olive oil a good olive oil is ideal because you'll taste it in this it's it's part of the the flavors of the dish alright so that's all we need and now we can get started so I've just got a bowl here to prepare the border well we're just going to put it in a bowl that is one cup and that we're going to add two cups of boiling water you don't really have to do anything to this now just leave that to sit for I don't know at least 30 minutes possibly an hour whenever if you get it done earlier in the day that's fine if you have any water after it's all absorbed if it's still got a little bit then you can just squeeze any excess our ship so this is what it looks like when it's all when it's absorbed all that's water the grains are all soft and there's no extra moisture in there as you can see can be very light now and fluffy so now we're ready to add all these salad items together and completely the tabbouleh so I'm just going to add the bottom whole wheat to the bowl you can see how that's really fluffy now and to that we're going to add the parsley now the parsley as you can see a flat leaf parsley you might know it as Italian parsley or continental parsley it's it's got a lovely really sort of strong flavor and that's what we use at home and that's what my parents still grow mountains of so that needs quite a lot of parsley that's fine it's sort of roughly chopped actually we're going to add the onion and the chopped tomatoes now they just finely chopped nothing too fancy and we'll add the salt and pepper the olive oil and the lemon juice now one that was the whole lemon squeezed I'm not going to add it all just yet I'm just going to give that a toss like that give it a taste and then add either oil or lemon or salt as it needs it to taste but really that's the basis of tabbouleh it's very simple very nutritious and lovely and refreshing so I hope you give that one a go too so here's our lovely refreshing - Pauly's salad great for barbecues easy to do and I hope you enjoy
