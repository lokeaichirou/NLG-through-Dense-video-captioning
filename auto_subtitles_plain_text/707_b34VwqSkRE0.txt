 if you love pot stickers at your favorite Chinese restaurant you'll definitely want to try this recipe it's submitted by Allrecipes member ie who uses ground beef and ground shrimp instead of the usual pork filling it's great to see a non pork recipe for pot stickers adds member a Vita this recipe makes fifty dumplings but we've cut it in half here to make 25 the uncooked dumplings freeze wonderfully if you do make the larger quantity we'll start by making the filling put half a pound of raw peeled and deveined shrimp in a food processor process until the shrimp are finely ground transfer them into a large bowl next you want to finely grind your beef in the food processor you'll use two pounds set it aside in the bowl of the shrimp now add 1/2 tbsp of minced fresh ginger half a minced shallot four chopped green onions 2 chopped leaves of napa cabbage 1 tablespoon of soy sauce 1/2 a teaspoon of Asian sesame oil this is the toasted kind it's dark brown rather than light a pinch of sugar a pinch of salt and ground white pepper to taste mix until everything is well combined this recipe makes a lot of extra filling which you can freeze for use later on place a wrapper on the work surface in front of you and put a little less than a teaspoon of filling in the center dip your finger in water and want it along the outside edge of the wrapper to moisten it fold the wrapper over into a Halfmoon shape as you seal the dumplings be sure to press out any air from the center if you like make several pleats in one side of the wrapper as you seal the edges this gives the dumpling their traditional look put the shaped pot stickers on a parchment lined baking sheet and keep them refrigerated as you assemble the remaining dumplings if you do make extra dumplings freeze them on the baking sheet transfer the dumplings to airtight plastic bags once they've frozen to avoid sticking together now it's time to cook the dumplings though they're called pot stickers you don't want them to stick so add a little vegetable oil about two tablespoons to the bottom of a nonstick skillet heat it over medium heat and add enough pot stickers to make a single layer in the pan put them flat side down and don't crowd the pan let the dumplings fry without disturbing them until the bottoms are golden brown about 1 to 2 minutes turn the dumplings over add a quarter cup of water and cover the pan with the lid let the dumplings steamed until the water is nearly evaporated 5 to 7 minutes you'll know when the water is gone because you'll start to hear sizzling and frying sounds when the pot stickers begin to fry in the oil again uncover the skillet and let the potstickers cook until the wrapper has completely shrunk down around the filling and the water is completely evaporated for another two to three minutes all recipes member a gussick says these are delicious labor-intensive but I froze most of them prior to cooking and they tasted just as good as the freshly made ones serve them with a soy dipping sauce you
