 hi it's angel today I'm going to be cooking up something a bit different I am actually going to be making us lunches to go now I absolutely love hot soup and I love ramen so I thought it'd be fun to make some DIY ramen bowls to go now the cool thing about it is that it only takes about five minutes to put together you can make them the night before and then take them to work or to school think of these as healthy instant noodles everything you need to make these suits are in these glass jars now as an added bonus I'm going to show you how to make to my favorite flavors miso and chicken so let's get started first start by cooking your noodles I'm using these deliciously yummy gluten-free ramen noodles which were made in Japan and come in these easy to use single serve pouches you can find them at your local Japanese grocer bring a pot of water to a boil and cook your noodles mine cook in about three minutes after that remove and rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process this will help keep them nice and chewy for the next day now comes the fun part it's time to assemble our ramen jars now I am using these widemouth 32 glass jars and I really like using them because not only are they dishwasher safe but they're also big enough to hold all the yummy ingredients and soup that we'll be putting in here now you can use whatever containers you want just remember to stay away from plastic because we will be adding hot water later now let's start with our miso ramen bowl I'm using about one and a half tablespoons of Shiro miso which is white miso then go ahead and put your noodles on top then over to the side I've prepared some ingredients which we'll be wrapping up in small pieces of plastic wrap so I've got two assaults eggs which I made last night and I just cut them in half I'll put a link to my video on how to make these if you're interested then we'll wrap some tofu you can also add vegetables like corn if you like next wrap together your green onions and also I have a little ETV togarashi tire which is just crushed red-pepper finally I have some CV which came wrapped already so I'm just going to place that inside the chocolate now the chicken ramen bowl first add chicken bullion paste I'm using about one and a half teaspoons then the noodles on top I'm also adding in a handful of raw broccoli and some shitake mushrooms next I also have soy sauce eggs and some tofu you can also add some cooked chicken as well leftover chicken pieces are great too finally our garnish our green onions once you have all your ingredients in your jars go ahead and cover it with the lid then you can store it in your fridge and it's ready via the next day when you're ready for your chicken ramen lunch remove the items in the plastic wrap add 2 cups of boiling water which is a bit more than halfway full and let it sit covered for 2 minutes after 2 minutes stir really well so the chicken bullion dissolves then you can go ahead and Tolu eggs and garnish next let's prepare the miso ramen again remove the ingredients in the plastic wrap add two cups of hot water wait two minutes then stir and add your ingredients saving the dried seaweed for last when you're done your ramen soup should look like this so that's it a quick DIY ramen bowl to go into delicious flavors the great thing about them is that they're a healthy alternative to instant noodles and you can customize these bowls with your own favorite ingredients to make your favorite soups to go I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel angel Wong's kitchen for more authentic Asian recipes made simple and fun I'll see you guys next time bye
