 I want to make some food euless we've been working hard I'm out of the rubber gear as you can see it started to get a bit cold actually so I've changed out of that but I've still got these muscles his muscles marine yeah a classic and the whole trick not to do too much to a muscle because these will be beautiful we need a big old cast-iron pan on the fire there with a splash of oil piece of garlic just like that release that off with a knife pop that on the ball there and we need them a little rough chop their long as they're nice and small we're swinging the world is a big old chunk of garlic between the two back teeth straight into the pan Little Miss Susan for that small onion and we'll just top him up into little squares and into the pan y key to some heating that fire right now i want it i want to put a little bit of lemon grass near i think we'll lemongrass be a nice flavor it's kind of a high kind of number really demographic beautiful peppermint spearmint kind of feel to it pop them in the fighters keep it ticking over just letting the flavors out of the garlic and the onions it's all about these muscles they look at these beautiful we had the same muscle in the UK we use them a lot but they're more about this size now that that's a big old plump muscle and I'm really interested to know if this long growth period because of this cold water makes them maybe more tasty or something like that anyway straight into a hot pan so they're in there now just ticking away and now we need to give them something to steam up with so a bit of seven young Blanc here we really just need to splash or two of this maybe one more I guess and let them just sit for about a minute what stars to him as they start to open look at that they are big fat and juicy can't wait for that you could sit here waiting for your muscles to cook all day long ever-changing landscape anyway there's a sizzle coming on this and that wine is starting to make those muscles open up so as that starts to happen we now need that cream to go in so just a little bit reem comes off the boil at that stage and they're sort of half open we now need them to fully open they just give up their juices they give up that little bit of sea and you end up with a nice and mussel soup in the bottom with some plumped lovely muscles to eat off the top it's not really the way they have it here in East Greenland duelists was saying mate they helped them put it into a soup with some other types of seafood but i think this with a bit of it all crusty bread you know every once in a while one of those icebergs out there cracks or rolls over or something I don't know but it's a really eerie sound such a magical place right it come back to the boil now the cream is boiling away all the muscles have open up their sprung open releasing those juices they're just perfect for serving I can smell white wine I can smell a touch of garlic but mostly I can smell those muscles I'm gonna serve these up into a big old bowl they do look good big and plump just pour a bit of that over the top like that big old chunk of crusty bread like that bowl the muscles like this I gotta taste one mmm delicious really like those big flavor big muscle flavor nice and plump they're beautiful
