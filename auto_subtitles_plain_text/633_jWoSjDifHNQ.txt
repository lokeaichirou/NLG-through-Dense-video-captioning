 hi everyone this is man um and today I'm here to teach you how to make chicken google geek I thought I would try to show you my mom's way to do it which means I've had to kind of figure out I've had to figure out the measurements that she's because she doesn't use exact measurements another reason why I like chicken blue boogie over the beef one so much the beef one has like the typical soy sauce garlic ginger and a little bit of sugar or honey for sweetness but the one that used for chicken it has a hot pepper paste this hot pepper paste already took some out it's very red it's very spicy and it's pasty so um when my mom used it with chicken I remember liking it better cause I'm spicier and she just made it less often so it felt like it was more special when she made it so first your choice of meat it can be chicken thighs and here we have or chicken thighs but you can also use two chicken breasts instead if you want to go on a lower fat route this is the hot pepper paste as I've already said and that's about I want to say a little over one third cup a little bit of honey instead of sugar but I would say that's about 1/3 of a cup that's been sitting out for too long outside and then here we have a chopped up ginger and I'll show you guys how to chop up ginger this isn't as fine as it could be but if you don't mind a couple of chunks of fine also if you don't have fresh ginger you can use I prefer not to but if you have this around and not fresh ginger that's mine same thing with garlic we have lower this is about 1 tablespoon about 2 tables here of garlic again you can use granulated garlic instead I prefer fresh in the 1 tbsp of soy sauce and I guess 1 tbsp of sesame oil and we've almost run out so I'm just going to pour straight out of the bottle and then 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 4 stalks of green onions that we're gonna chop in and the end and before we get started I'll show you how to chop up ginger it looks really hairy and weird once you chop off all the outside woody part and it looks like this and it looks like it's hard to chop but almost really not so you do it against the grain like this and it's all hairy and then you get the bottom end of a nice cool little finer if you'd like but I just don't like doing that also you could use a food processor but after you do that just weather and the same thing with some garlic you should squish it like that to release all the juices and then stop finer if you like but you don't have to if you like it chunky a little bit okay let's get started on the assembly all right this is a very TV pretty because I don't want to do as many dishes as we're done okay so first take place only okay five do that okay so first take your PC ingredients and then put it in your bowl and if you don't have money but you have like brown sugar or white sugar you should use a little less than shown here but it should still be fine and then sweep it makes it a little bit for my spoon Department 1 tablespoon up any oil ginger a ton of garlic and then and we're on the green onions instead of chopping them up I just like using my shears kitchen shears because it makes it a lot easier and I also like using green onions instead of onions so there's less liquid when we're cooking on the show where if you're grilling I guess if you are using a grill I think for green on your left college I like to clean I want to get to the wider part I like to cut it in half and start cutting because that parts a bit stronger okay and it's just well really spicy okay just put it in easier now that the marinade is done I'm going to take our chicken pieces and then start going to remove the fat off and then chopping against the green as well for the fat just kind of put it and I know either fattier cut of meat but I like the way it tastes better with this marinade but again we've done it with chicken too so that's not a huge deal Oh and then so you see the grain happening going this way right so you should cut about how big would you say this is half an inch thick long strip chicken by okay so I just got done trimming the fat off of the 42 the five and sure they are and then we're almost done now they're just going to sit like this in the fridge for an hour I mean earlier this week when we made this we just rotated immediately and it tastes it perfectly fine and it was really good with lettuce wrap and we're going to do that again but today since I'm worried I mean it's not dinnertime yet that's why I'm feeling much earlier so I'm going to let it marinate and it always does piece a little better when it's marinating anyway so we're going to let this marinate until it's the right time and then I'll show you how you can fold up a lot of straps you can enjoy this with whether it's romaine lettuce or green leaf or red leaf or butter flooded with white rice either sticky rice or long grain or brown rice we've done it all and it all tastes really good so on we'll let this marinate and we'll come back when we start cooking okay so my husband herb be struggling with us on the stovetop so so I have a medium heat right now with about a little less than a tablespoon of oil we're using a really small skillet use the bigger one if you have it we have a bigger one but the nonstick has like scraped off this time and it's pretty terrible still I don't want to use our old frying pan try to drift off bump stir it and I think we're going to cook about half at a time make your it sizzling so how those clean parents must've thrown it get more cooked I don't always do that but I thought I would try to keep things clean our dog is watching us she's only begging you can't eat this Noli so here's a chicken sauce here's a three main component of the wrap I guess with some rice and we have some lettuce here we have the romaine lettuce on so you would take a couple of pieces I like a little more than this guy but depends on your part friend of rice or a lot depending how much you can fit in except to eat this on camera and then like a small bite of chicken we don't we like spicy raw onions you can also have raw or cooked large chunks of garlic you can have slices of cooked or raw jalapeno peppers depends again on your preference then here we have the dipping sauce and it's called some done or a mild soybean paste that's been fermented on de de with a lot of other meats that are rackable and lettuce too so basically it's like some soybean paste some like garlicky flavor some fat so you put it on there as best as you can with all of your ingredients and then you eat it oh um okay so these lettuce wraps the really good way to enjoy barbecued meats or like cooked Korean meats with like a couple of other raw vegetables if you'd like I hope that you enjoyed watching it and that you'll try it and um you'll let me know how it goes
