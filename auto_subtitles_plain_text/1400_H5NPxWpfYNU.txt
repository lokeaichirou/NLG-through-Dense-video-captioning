 today we're gonna make bulgogi it's a basically Korean barbecued meat now in here I have half a cup of soy sauce and a quarter cup of water water helps cut the soy sauce down a little bit now I have three three tablespoons of brown sugar have some green onion 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds I have two pieces of ginger two slices of ginger that I've peeled I've got four cloves of garlic that I've crushed up well here's a tip on some ginger I found an old piece of ginger in refrigerator what I'm gonna do is whenever I get done cooking the day I'm gonna throw it down the garbage disposal be the last thing I put in there and that'll help keep the garbage disposal smelling good anyway got three tablespoons of apple sauce can't believe I forgot what that was called anyway pinch a black pepper about a tablespoon sesame oil soy sauce is just starting to bubble a little bit let's go ahead and mix everything up good I want to heat the soy sauce up pretty good but I don't really want to cook it right now just want to make sure all the sugar dissolves the garlic gets heated up the ginger he gets heated up and all that'll give off its flavor to the marinade and here I have about half of a large onion they're not really quite a large onion a medium to large onion sliced through pretty thin all right my soy sauce is up good and hot again I'm gonna pour this into the onion mix all right and we'll let this cool down I'll have my beef here let's just really thinly sliced I didn't slice it I bought it already sliced from the Korean market I'm gonna do cut it in the smaller piece I'm just gonna cut these pieces in half maybe I only going this way too you know take my marinade don't take throw these pieces of beef in there as you can see my beef just barely fits in my bowl but then I don't have any room to mix it up so put it in a bigger ball you can use this same marinade to make Kobe just mix this up it's like I could have made a little more marinade - I think we're gonna be alright and then we're gonna let this marinate for about an hour all right meats been marinating for a while so we're gonna take some of this meat and we're gonna cook it cook a little bit more I want to have some extra what you can do is you can just put it in a ziploc bag and freeze it and you can have some for later now you would have some chopped che noodles in here you put on water soak them for about 20 minutes and then while it's cooking it's just about done throwing it in there my kids love them I like them but I'm not gonna put any in there today anyway we're just gonna let this keep cooking it started cooked down now even close yeah I think that pretty much looks done to me we'll need to cook it to nothing anyway go ahead and turn that off we'll get ready to eat all right time for a taste test let's see what we got or
