 all right today I'm going to make sushi hand rolls now this is actually pretty easy compared to the rest of the rolling for sushi but it consists of your same ingredients you know you've got your sushi rice you get your favorite sushi meat and your veggies then of course you got to make your spicy sauce now starting that with your rice it's pretty meticulous I'm not going to go through the whole thing but with your rice you've got to have the right grain the right kind of rice you've got to do a whole process what's cleaning it rinsing it several times letting it soak and then after you cook it and you've got to do this rice vinegar sugar and salt mixture and yada yada yada anyway there's sushi rice videos online if you want to look that up right now I'm just going to show you how to do the roll once everything is pretty much prepared I've already got my scallions my cucumber right here I'm going to mix the spice that goes into the spicy mayo that goes into the Aussie tunics I'm going to make a spicy tuna hand roll here and of course I've got my nori and I've got my rice ready to go so let's now I've got this beautiful tuna steak here it's almost an inch thick and it all cost me a couple bucks sometimes it varies in price and whatnot you know the better the tuna obviously but this is ahi tuna that's what I'm going to be using it's my favorite to use for a spicy tuna hand-roll veggies white you know I've just got a scallions in the cucumber like I mentioned a moment ago if you can do you know various things you know a lot of times people like to use avocado in there but we're going to do is we're going to slice this up into small little pieces because we're going to mix it with the spicy mayo and I'll show you how to make that it's real simple it's just use here with this service and the mail and we'll get to that there we go now you can see I chopped it all up and I did it cross grain so I can get all these little individual pieces here and I can just mix it all up here with a fork and whip it really good when I make this spicy meal now this is really simple if you haven't seen this by now then you've probably never eaten anywhere else Chinese why Japanese wise Buffet wise who she was anywhere you ought to know this at least somewhere really spicy really thought and the beautiful thing is is you add as much as you want to your spicy taste you know if you don't want so much you want a lot whatever but if you've never really mix it before use it sparingly so you don't you don't overpower your palate and I'm just going to mix a little bit of that in there right now and you can stir it up just like fry sauce and if you don't know what fry sauce is well then you're not an American get some nice color in that get a good pink as you can see not a big deal and then what I'll be doing here we'll come to the Augie tuna and we'll just pile that on in there mix it all up get ready for the mixture here stir it all in together and then we'll get going with the nori stuck in the rice and move from there okay there as you can see that are all mixed up it's all incorporated good deal where'd it go now let's get the nori case you can know this is the nori the the toasted seaweed you want to put the shiny side down the texture side up and going to work your dice here there's about a cup of ice always get your hand wet so it doesn't stick to you because it gets a little insane if it does but you take about half game out there and we'll just plop that right down there in the middle and mash that out and what you want is a spacing right here diagonally a lot of different ways to do this actually I've seen several different ways whatever is comfortable but this is a good way okay it can match your finger right down there in the middle so you can start laying in the gigs buy the goods I mean the veggies okay start with the veggies first couple bits of cucumber okay no big deal doesn't have to be perfect and then right over the top of it we're going to start dumping in a spicy tuna now you can't just go as much as you want in there unfortunately you can only roll so much but you want to keep the bulk of it up top because that's just like an ice cream cone where the bulk is going to fit in the let's run out down inside the roll okay and that's probably good about right there all right now the tricky part now is doing the roll okay the easiest way is to go ahead and just take this thing slide it like this off in to your hand like so I almost lost it see how tedious it can be not a big deal to just roll it just like this right over like an ice cream cone keep the bottom tucked tight roll it around roll it around keep on working it baby keep on working it baby right down here in the bottom corner I'm going to take just one little rice right here mash it and that's going to help me stick it to the bottom right there just like that okay now to top it off some scallions and there you have it one spicy tuna hand roll right here in the poor man's gourmet kitchen
