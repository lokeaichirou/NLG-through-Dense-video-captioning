 hi everyone welcome to thrifty crafts today we're going to cook a vegan dish which will be a traditional Korean kimchi but vegan so it's a very nice traditional dish yet without all the fish ingredients you want to press pause here and have a careful look at all the ingredients you're going to need and you're also gonna have other requirements such as a bowl blender cheesecloth and a plastic glove and this is a bowl of leeks and radish along with some garlic and pine nuts I just wanted to show you what your ingredients should look like once you've gathered them all together but step one very important step is you need to pickle some sliced radish and they need to be soft and you need to hold on make sure you don't get rid of the liquid because you're gonna need them later then step two you want to dice all your leeks and your Korean radish and and the leeks you want to cut about an inch and then cut them vertically going with the grain this is just for presentation it just looks a little cleaner and nicer and it looks more appetizing so here's a dish of leeks and radish it should look like that you should have two leeks in there and one radish all diced up and there's a Korean radish all dice if you have a Dicer table that would make your life a lot easier if you're making kimchi next step what we're going to do is blend ginger Spanish onion garlic pine nuts and the pickled radish with the fluid all together now they're not gonna all fit in the blender so you're probably going to have to divide them up and if you don't like pine nuts you can skip out on the pine nuts the more pine nuts you put the more pine nut flavor you'll get out of the kimchi but you can always skip that so here we go we're going to blend everything together by the way if you have Windex at home instead of using Windex you can make your own cleaner with vinegar and water quarter vinegar and three-quarters water and it works just like Windex but it's better for your health and the environment so now what we're going to do is put on the gloves and pour all that blended stuff into a cheesecloth now what we need is just the liquid so we're not going we're gonna make sure that we strain out all the other residues and you're going to have to do this a few times so you're going to have to squeeze out all the juice and again blend everything remaining and squeeze it again and you're gonna do this over and over again until you squeeze out all the juice out of the ingredients that we're blending together now if you need some more fluid you can always use the the strained fluid again and put it back into the blender that's fine but you're just gonna have to string it out again this will just help the blending process a little more step six you want to add the blended fluid to the bowl of week and radish so make sure you put them all together and then we're going to add the hot pepper flakes now you can use mild hot pepper flakes depending on how spicy you want your kimchi to be and you also want to use your flakes accordingly because if you want it really spicy you can add as much as we're adding here if you can't handle spice as much you might want to reduce the amount of hot flicks that will be going into the bowl and of course you want to stir occasionally to make sure you are mixing them all together if you're wondering why there's so many is a block of hot pepper flakes it's because we're using different spice level of hot pepper flakes you can mix them up you can put really hot mix it with mild or you can just put spicy or you can just put mild it's up to you I know we're putting a lot of hot pepper flakes here it's very very spicy traditional kimchi then we also wanted to add two and a half tablespoon of salt as well and don't forget to taste it a little bit you want to make sure that it's not too salty I also want to include here that sea salt is much better for you and it's also tastier then you want to add one tablespoon of honey just to get a little bit of sweetness and this is what you should be left with now what we're going to do is show you how to marinate the cabbage you want to cut off some of the stem it's a little bit Brown don't worry that's just things from the soil and you can just cut those pieces off like so and if you see any brown meats you also want to get rid of those as well now once you have your cabbage in your bowl you want to take some of the marination and just dab it all over and do it generously and you want to put more on the bottom and less as you go to the top as the leaves get smaller and just apply them everywhere generously with your gloves on this is where gloves come in very handy because you don't want your hands to smell like garlic for the next week or have the red stains so once you've put all these marination all over the cabbage what you want to do is wrap them if you can with the last leaf kind of and twirling around the rest of them so it's just so that everything holds together and they may not always look like that and that's okay the whole point is just a smear all the marination all over the cabbage and don't forget to do it layer by layer so peel each leaf at a time as you apply the stuffing the kimchi stuffing and again you want to make sure that you have a stainless steel container or a glass container make sure you don't put it in plastic containers it's not good for your health and you'll find that it tastes a lot better in a glass container possible and that's it so thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time
