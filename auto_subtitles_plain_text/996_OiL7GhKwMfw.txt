 with a very great chef famous shaman we pala dad before he died it's from a ton of combo my destiny and he was a really really brilliant chef was the youngest chef ever in France to receive two Michelin stars and he really taught me to appreciate foie gras and and the whole dog for everything that would that it hasn't you know the doc is the equivalent of the pork you know you can eat everything in the doc you need everything in the pig you know you use all the feathers for down there's this really beautiful you know relationship with these animals and I think Jean Louie was one of the one of the greatest chefs - I feel very fortunate opportunity for it but he showed me there's a true beauty of what okay so the floor drop gonna break the Louvre in half so with flora it's really important because it's fat that you score it not only for its presentation but the reason is being scored is so that the salt gets into it see some foie gras pretty that really don't be afraid so no fat in the pan because this is all you want to steer for untie eat because you want it to caramelize if you sear it too low you just ran around on the fat you have any color you really need to bring bring the flavor forward by giving convo-sation you know we brought the far-out ice core you let it come to ten so it cooks through evening flora needs to be cooked through but you don't want it rock-hard this is it don't cook it like grandma's liver and onions okay because it's pretty and nasty how many tell who said badly burnt onions pretty much everybody every said bad liver nights you want it to be rich luscious whatever I'm supposed to be as anxious deliciousness not area there we go so I'm going to throw in a little bit of time here the bar itself is dense right now a nice color but you want it to be soft to the touch not for something to put in the oven when you come to my restaurant and you order foie gras you get one drop I don't believe in cheating people in their meal see a lot of times you hear we're gonna have flour on our dish and it's a one ounce portion and you come and you have these expectations of what you're gonna have for dinner and I'm gonna deliver that expectation you will either over went on the word extremely ecstatic no fancy molecular techniques now thank you just classic old-school roasting
