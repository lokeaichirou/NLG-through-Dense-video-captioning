 which is quite large but you can use any any cabbage you like how to leave today you Brown and then half lengthways so we've got quarters and I just run my knife actually and then we want to slice it up for the for the soccer and it's really it's up to you how thick you make it how much pain you have how could you not feel back that easy you get thrown meister out so try and try and cut it fairly finely then we're just gonna pop it in a bowl any kind of really big chunky bits you can pull out it's up to you so I'll just keep going and cutting up the rest of the cabbage chopped it in your bowl then we're gonna add some salt and any any salt we just want some really fine salt or kosher salt whatever regular table salt is fine and I'm just gonna go about 3/4 kind of generous pinches is a fair bit of cabbage there the rule of thumb is you really want about one percent by weight but it's really not super important what I tend to do is just get some salt and start max our team working it around then it looks like I know it looks like it's good enough very like a huge amount of gravity but you'll be surprised it's gonna pack down pop it in the jar so what we're gonna do is just kind of mouth watch this salt in I don't usually like you bitter and then leave it for a little while like a few minutes and have a rest and do something else I just so I didn't get to but with it I pull out any chunks like that just ink so yeah I'll just keep it message for another few minutes and then let it rest for 5 minutes or so sound cuts I've message for about five minutes been sitting for about five minutes and you can see conclude like it looks kind of glassy you like the waters starting to come out of it be a little bit wet on the outside which is great so now I'm just gonna have a little taste oh so you want it to taste a little bit salty but no snow already proud that tastes probably a little bit too salty but it'll have to do so you know it's not much you can do by too much salt and the most thought you are the easier it is to into the job so it's not such a bad thing I've actually found what I enjoy it as much so it's a personal preference thing around really puts it down really hard and moisture out the crap and because we want the fermentation to happen under liquid and you're not gonna believe this when you start packing into a job oh I think you know it's never gonna get enough liquid art and in the end it always does so so I'm just gonna pack it in and just keep packing it is probably easier with my hand just squishing down big big brutal and you'll start to see the link but all that cabbage packed into the jar and you wouldn't believe it hey like all that cabbage in the bowl has packed into a jar you know I think about feeling about package are it surprises me every time I do it so I've just spent a few minutes really packing it down with my hand with a spoon hopefully you've gotta see that there's a fair bit of liquid in there it's not it's you know more and more is coming out each time and like it takes a little while and well sometimes what I do is that I pack it in and I'm not getting the liquid I just let it sit for five minutes walk away from it and then come back to it and like this salt draw the liquid I hope this furball in the background is this story so what we liquid is really important because the fermentation has to be has to happen under under the liquid in anaerobic environments if it's air there they lactic acid bacteria can't do their thing so just keep pushing down with the screen and if you get really you know frustrated and you finally not getting the liquid out you can always just top it up with a little bit of water but the problem with water is it's going to dilute the flavor of the sauerkraut sometimes you'll get to a point where you just go oh I couldn't be bothered so that's looking pretty good to me so okay so you know that you not completely submerge there's a lot of fair bit of that going around so what we're gonna do now is just put the lid on and let it sit at for a few days so I'll take another game tomorrow sauerkraut have you look on the side again can't hear any gas coming out but when I push you can see the heaps of liquid there now so glad I didn't put any extra liquid in what we're just gonna do just push it down so that the the layers on the top are submerged but you can see there's bubbles so it definitely looks like fermentation is starting to Hamilton and sometimes it will take more than a day for the fermentation is disturbed I'm kind of surprised it's winter here and it's been really cold but again had they had it paintin the hit get a fire going so that's keeping them warm enough so just push it push down keep up on it and then just lay them on the kitchen bench we'll check in again not tomorrow okay so it's actually day for today since I put the veg in and I forgot to check them yesterday so see okay so that's not a lot of guts coming out of the sock right yep but if we push it down you can see that's quite it's bubbling try to be in and you can see it's actually starting to smell a bit um ferment in it so I'm actually going to going to have a little bit of a taste lovely so it's got that kind of salty thing going on it and been obtained and for me that's so I'm going to push it down so it's it's submerge I'm going to pop that in your fridge and I'm happy to start eating that now but I don't like myself crack means you strongly flavored so it's really up to you you know whether you're happy with the flavor then you can pop it in the fridge and see you
