 when George Wilson onda and rider and welcome and venality i'm going to show you some very quick easy fast simple Italian recipes okay the one we're going to do today is called piminy Asamoah infocom so is thin pasta with a smoked salmon and vodka sauce it's actually in Italian recipe however some of the ingredients are not Italian such as vodka and smoked salmon okay so let's go ahead see how this works so the ingredients that we have to make this recipe are very basic very simple we have some smoked salmon this is some smoked salmon that I picked up from a local grocery store so I'm sure you wouldn't have Charles trouble finding it it's about six to eight ounces the portions here are good for about four people okay chives are going to be used at the very end for decoration I have a shallot that is a to have a small onion it's very very flavorful more intense than regular onion I have about two tablespoons of butter tomato paste I'm going to be using about a tablespoon of tomato paste the reason why these back is because I get a flavor from the tomato without having necessarily all the moisture and lick lick from this meal um vodka and i also have heavy cream and which is going to make it as a nice rich dish and also some frozen parsley that I keep in the facility to the freezer all the time so that's very handy okay so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to drop up and put it on medium heat and I'm going to put just a splash of extra virgin olive oil just a little bit okay so that's maybe a teaspoon and again i'm gonna be using butter so i'm going to in the olive oil the reason why I do use a little bit of olive oil is because it's going to keep the butter from burning so while that melts okay I'm gonna fit I'm going to go ahead and chop the shout it I have a lot of a ton of stable friends and their excuse is always well I'm not really cooking just for myself you know it's so time consuming I'm just I'm gonna do that oh this is really a no excuse recipe it's just it's just too easy too quick not to not to do it okay and upset because we're making vanilla vodka I'm upset because I just chopped a shallot hey so I've chopped my Sheldon's manage not cutting fingers and I'm throwing in the I'm just going to let these simmer a little bit and just brown a little bit okay while the onions are browning I'm just going to cut this into small strips as best as you know how doesn't have to be perfect but it does need to be quick i'm going to go ahead and throw about half the salmon in okay chopped off okay you can ensure that a little bit right this part so let me tell you if you are going to make this recipe at home you want to help you watch them so let the loop it okay i'm actually going to be using about three quarter of a cup we put in the vodka and we're just gonna let it reduce a little bit technically you could do a little flamb√© action get inflamed both going but in fulfilling this in my home I want to set the house on fire commit to get that okay so we're ready to put into the tomato paste and again this is fascinates a fast recipe i melted the tomato a little bit and I'm going to throw in about three quarters of a cup of heavy cream into the sauce I'm going to we're going to lower the heat little bit i'm going to throw in the parsley this is actually fresh parsley that i previously pros so i just keep it in the freezer what I need to ok and now I'm throwing in the chives I'm throwing in the remaining famine that I've got chopped up here I can turn off the heat I'm just gonna sprinkle some a little bit of salt there's actually like salt in smoked salmon already so I'm not going to fit as much just a little bit of flavor and freshly ground pepper that's all okay I'm just going to throw it directly into my case oh you want to make sure you taste them make sure there's salt and they're all set just some freshly ground pepper okay and we're done penne alla vodka someone a coma castle one of the people to see got the enjoy
