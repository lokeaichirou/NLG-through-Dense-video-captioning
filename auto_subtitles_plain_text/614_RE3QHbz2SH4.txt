 just in time for st. Patrick's Day I've got a great recipe that everyone is sure to love it's Irish potato cakes with apple cranberry sauce so I've started by boiling two pounds of potatoes just as if I are making mashed potatoes because I am making mashed potatoes drain the potatoes in a colander then add in some butter and some salt and some chopped garlic and some audience and then mash the potatoes they feel their chunky smooth okay pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees and then take a spoonful of the potato mixture and on a parchment lined baking sheet drop lane' on there and flatten them out into about half-inch rounds and then brush them with melted butter and then bake them in the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes until the edges are brown and crispy meanwhile make the applesauce by cooking cubed apples in some butter then add in about 8 ounces of cranberries and a quarter cup of wine bring that to a boil and then cook it for about 10 minutes until about all the liquid has evaporated I remove the apples and cranberries to my food processor now add some lemon zest and some lemon juice and a couple of tablespoons of honey and this is a hot very hot product here so I'm going to be careful when I process it and makes an applesauce serve these hot potato cakes with a dollop of that beautiful applesauce get the recipe for free by writing to the here at the station or log on to the website click on the kitchen guide page I'm chef Jim thanks for watching kitchen guy the tastiest two minutes in television happy st.
