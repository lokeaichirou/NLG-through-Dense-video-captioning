 another winter warmer rescue for you and here's my recipe for a beef cottage pie with in a secret ingredient for an extra crispy topping and for the ingredients you'll need 500 grams of beef mince 3 carrots 2 onions from oil to fry some tomato puree some oyster sauce a beef stock cube 750 grams of potatoes a knob of butter a dash of milk and some ready salted crisps so we'll start by preparing the onions cut each end off chop them in half and then peel then with a sharp knife carefully finely chop them and then set the onions aside and now it's time for the carrots slice each end off peel them and then slice them lengthwise and then finely chop with you night now that your carrots are ready you need to get a large partners to go on the hop then pour in some oil so we can fry get your onions and carrots that we prepared earlier and then throw them in the pan and fry for about five minutes then get your beef mince and throw that in the pan as well along with a couple of major squirts of tomato puree some lashings of Worcester sauce and crumble in the beef stock then give everything a stir and keep frying until the mince goes nice and brown and then when your mince sauce looks something like this boil the kettle and pour some water over the top so the contents are just about colored then give everything one final stir and leave it to simmer for about 40 to 50 minutes or until the sauce is thickened nicely and meanwhile we can start preparing the mashed potato so peel all your spuds and then chop them into chunks when your potatoes are ready put some hot water on the go in a saucepan and then leave them to boil for about 15 minutes once your potatoes are done get yourself a colander and then pour the potatoes in to drain the water then put them back in the saw spoon pour in your dash of milk and then put in your knob of butter then get your potato masher and then mash the potatoes so they're nice and smooth like me now once your min sauce is finished simmering and you've got a nice thick sauce give it a final stir and then take off the heat and now it's ready to stick everything into an oven dish firstly spoon out your mint sauce into the dish and then level it out so it's nice and flat now get your mashed potato and spread that on top of the mint sauce and I find its easiest to do if you spoon it out and then use the back of a spoon to spread it over and make it nice and flat once you have a nice uniform layer of mashed potato get a fork and draw some lines in the top and this will help it to crisp up a little easier now bust open your packet ready salted crisps crush them between your hands whilst they're still in the packets are there nice and fired then sprinkle them evenly on the top of the cottage pie and now it's ready for the oven so stick it on about 190 degrees and then put the cottage pie in for about 35 to 40 minutes and make sure you keep an eye on it to make sure it's not burning and it's crispy on nicely when it's golden brown and it's bubbling at the edges you know it's cooked and it's ready to serve so why not enjoy this cottage pie with your favorite veg this winter tah-dah and remember to check out even more of my recipes by clicking on one of the videos coming up
