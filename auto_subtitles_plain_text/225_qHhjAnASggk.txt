 here are the following items needed you will need some all-purpose flour dried parsley flakes salt ground black pepper corn starch and of course a russet potato some onions and an egg I'm so excited I finally get to use my V slicer I'm going to start off by slicing my potato into thin julienne strips safety first don't forget to use your guard when slicing because it is very dangerous as you can see you get nice long julienne strips I'm gonna do a run cup of thinly sliced onion now add your dry parsley flakes all-purpose flour and cornstarch the cornstarch will help make the hash brown extra crispy ground black pepper and salt for taste toss and mix everything together if you want to get messy you can use your hand or if not use a pair of tongs I'm going to add one beat an egg to is this mixture just divide everything together again you want to toss and mix in a medium non-stick pan on high heat I'm going to add in some cooking oil make sure the pan is really hot before you put in your hash bone mixture once you add the mixture on the pan make sure you sort of spread it evenly and thin that way you'll get a beautiful crunch on the exterior of the hash brown I've reduced my heat to medium-high heat you want to cook each side until it's got a beautiful brown color before you flip it or each side it should take about three to four minutes it's ready to be flipped look at that you get the beautiful brown color now just cook the other side until it's golden brown and Lola it's done I like to put it on a piece of paper towel when it's done just to soak a bit of that oil out I love to serve this with a side of ketchup I hope you guys give this recipe a try as always I want to say thank you everyone so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye
