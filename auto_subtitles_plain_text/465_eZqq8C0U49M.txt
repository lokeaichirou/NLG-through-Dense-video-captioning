 hey everybody its rocky so last night I made some chicken parmesan Oh was it good I mean seriously it was he was delicious I mean this is definitely one I'll be adding to kind of like a regular rotation it was simple super simple all I did was like just season the chicken tossed in the pan with some sauce and some cheese it wasn't breaded and I threw it in the oven for half an hour and then but I Bing but boom there was my dinner I didn't show this but I actually did serve it alongside of some steamed spinach and it was just it was perfection so if you want to see how I make my version of chicken parmesan and just keep on watching so I have my chicken breasts out and I just have a combination here of salt black pepper and garlic and I'm just gonna sprinkle that over my chicken breasts and I'm just gonna rub that in and I want to make sure they're they're nice and coated I want the chicken itself to have flavor have you better like gone to a restaurant and you're eating something that you know is some kind of like piece of chicken or whatever that has sauce on it but when you bite into the actual chicken it tastes like nothing and I really hate that so we're gonna turn it over and we're going to do this exact thing to the other side I have 1/2 cups measured out in a measuring cup of just regular pasta sauce and right now I'm just gonna pour in about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese and I'm just gonna mix that together I have a baking pan that I sprayed down with some olive oil spray and I'm just gonna pour some of my sauce down right onto the pan just kind of make a little bed for my chicken breast to lay down on get my chicken breast and lay it right down on top of the sauce just like that and now we're going to pour the remaining sauce over the chicken breasts and just make sure they're all covered with sauce then I'm just gonna pop them into a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes or until my chicken is cooked through all right 30 minutes later it is out of the oven and it is cooked through so I'm going to go ahead and do is put down some mozzarella cheese right over the top and this is this cheese is part skim geez I get from Trader Joe's all right I'm gonna put it back in the oven for about five minutes or until the cheese is melted and here is our unbraided chicken parmesan right out of the oven the cheese is just kind of like melting off each of the chicken breasts it smells so good I cannot wait to dig into this so if anybody has any questions just go ahead and post them below the full recipe and pictures will be on my website which I'll post a link to below and until next time enjoy
