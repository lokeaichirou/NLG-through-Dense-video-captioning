 hi everybody this is Diana from sweetie Salado and today we're going to make spaghetti and meatballs a classic recipe where we're going to make our marinara sauce or gravy from scratch using tomatoes and onions and lots and lots of garlic and then meatballs come out amazingly tender and moist on the inside as always the link for this recipe is going to be available at the end of the video and in the infobox below so first we're going to make our marinara sauce so in a large pot we're going to heat some olive oil on medium heat and then we're going to add some white onion that has been chopped and we're gonna cook the onion for about five to ten minutes then we're going to add lots and lots of garlic I'm using about five cloves and we're going to cook this for about a minute or two to the onion and garlic mixture we're going to add some Tomatoes i'm using crushed tomatoes because i'd like a really velvety sauce but if you want it chunkier you can use whole tomatoes and crushed tomatoes then we're going to add one to two bay leaves we're also going to add a couple teaspoons of salt this is just to begin with we're going to add more later on and then we're also going to add some white sugar now we're going to cover this and we're going to cook it on low heat for about an hour and a half and in the meantime we are going to make our meatballs so to make our meatballs we're going to add some ground beef to a large bowl you can also use pork and veal I'd like to use ground beef then we're going to add a couple of eggs some freshly grated Parmesan cheese flat-leaf parsley bread crumbs oregano basil nutmeg chopped garlic and salt and pepper to taste now we're going to mix everything with our hands as much as we can and then once most of it is well blended we are going to add about half a cup of warm water and this is going to make our meatballs nice and smooth then we're going to shape our meatballs using our hands and to make it easier i'm using an ice cream scooper this also helps me to make sure that they're all and even size and once we have our meatballs ready we're going to place them on a lined cookie sheet or baking dish and then we're going to bake them at 350 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes or until they're cooked through and once you take them out you can either freeze them to use later or add them to the sauce to give it a more meaty flavor now after an hour and a half of cooking we are going to add some tomato paste this is completely optional but it makes your sauce a little bit thicker so if you want it run here you don't have to add it we're also going to add some parsley oregano basil we're going to give it a stir and we're also going to taste for seasoning because tomatoes take a lot of salt so if it needs more salt you can add it right now before adding your meatballs to the sauce and once you add your meatballs we're going to cover this and we're going to cook for another 30 minutes in the meantime we are going to cook our pasta according to the package instructions and then once it's cooked all we have to do is serve we're going to serve a nice portion of spaghetti and then on top we're going to add a couple meatballs we're also going to add lots of gravy on top and then we're going to sprinkle some freshly grated Parmesan cheese and that's your recipe for making spaghetti and meatballs from scratch if you enjoyed this video and this recipe please give it a thumbs up share with your friends and subscribe to this channel which is absolutely free and then that way you can be up to date with all new videos that I upload in the future and don't forget that you can follow me on facebook twitter instagram pinterest and google+ thanks everybody for watching and i hope to see you next time bye bye in blimp voyage you
