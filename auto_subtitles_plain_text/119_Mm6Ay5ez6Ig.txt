 they are going to make vegetable spring rolls young let me tell you what goes into this dish we're gonna start with carrots celery cilantro green onions frozen green peas shiitake mushrooms cabbage bean sprouts and we're gonna wrap them up in spring roll wrappers we're gonna use canola oil for frying today but peanut oil or vegetable oil works just great too so we need to get our pot hot because we're gonna cook some of those vegetables so I take my carrot I started the fat in and I'm gonna shred it ah pretty I think that's enough I'm gonna put about 1 tablespoon of my oil swish that around and toss our carrots in there to start cooking turn on the stove I'm going to turn that on high and start heating your oil I've already poured it in there that's about three inches in that pot the next densest vegetable we're going to be cooking is our celery I use the very end of the summary - nothing goes to waste in my kitchen ok but the pot goes give it stir alright next now have these really beautiful shiitake mushrooms they give it such a great flavor these are fresh they used to be like 10 to 15 a pound but I have been watching and the year says goodbye and I get these now for about 350 450 a pound which is excellent nothing gives the Chinese flavor in a dish like a shiitake mushroom all right in the pot that goes it's looking a little dry to me I know a little more oil of that that's a total of two tablespoons of oil that's on medium now and I am stirring this it is time to add a little salt to that this is probably 1/2 teaspoon of salt there it up next I'm gonna add our green onions also called spring onions I'm gonna cut them the same little kind of cut kind of a vertical and then away we go so I cut the white parts and that's gonna go my saute pan but the tops are gonna be work for garnish because it's pretty they're the lightest of the flavor of the onion so stick those white parts in and halfway up that stock and the rest will be for garnish swish swish now let's shred that cabbage so to do that is cut very thin pieces the goal is to have almost the same quantity of everything but I have a little extra cabbage it's easy to cook easy to cut and I love the flavor in it quite sweet stir that around and you're gonna let that cook for two minutes we're gonna put some foil on to it like so chop it up just chop the leaves don't to the stems the stems can be a little woody so add your cilantro add your bean sprouts that's about 1 cup of bean sprouts there that yeah that looks really good my cabbage is getting a little soft that's perfect hey it's been 1 minute this bean sprouts are softer now good let's take off the heat yeah so with her 1/2 cup of frozen peas I had rinsed them and they started to defrost and they're just about cooked anyways I do not like these overcooked so this is fine just to go into our hot mixture and I also like it because this is gonna bring down the temperature of my hot mixture so I don't kill my fingertip so I'm trying to wrap this now just toss them around break them up oh my gosh I want to eat this right now let's open our wonton wrappers so you'll find your equal wrappers or your spring roll wrappers in the refrigerated section of your grocery door make it look like a diamond that you're looking at and put in two tablespoons of your mixture so you put it on the part closest to you and you take your little corner and you stick it like that you know what a little extra because you want it firmly in there and then you start putting in your other corners like that and roll it in and when you get to the end a little water because you want to seal it one time let's do another all right two tablespoons in your diamond start a rolling tuck in your sides keep on rolling little water voila that's as easy as it gets so I'm gonna finish up and then we're gonna fry these things yeah yeah how about a spring roll today so now we're gonna test the oil and make sure it's hot enough so I just drop in whatever ingredient you got handy I've got some carrots in my hand from that dish yeah it's definitely hot enough so we're gonna put in three at a time because we want to keep that temperature of our oil hot if you put in more than three you have a larger batch and doesn't get as crispy you're gonna cook them probably one minute per side if your oil is really hot like mine is what you're looking for is a toasty brown color so when you see it get toasty Brown now there you go look at that guy see that so then he gets flipped over flip nice-looking egg rolls this one's about ready to come out it's really all about just getting the exterior cook because you know the interior is cooked perfectly happy onto our paper towel there's the other one there we go Oh beautiful so put them in carefully by putting in one end and dropping them slowly you don't it's a splatter on you now just gently toss them around in a circle so that all sides get cooked evenly it should take one to two minutes for this step it goes really fast but you better be here to babysit them they'll get away land will turn brown really fast beautiful I have made a little sauce which is my favorite of white vinegar and chopped garlic and I use a little soy sauce so into the dip we do a perfectly manicured bite let's try it oh my god it is better than any restaurant spring roll I'm not kidding you it's a talking mushroom it's got so much flavor in it so Chongqing Cheers
