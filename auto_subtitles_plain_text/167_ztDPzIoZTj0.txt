 hey everybody welcome to the Wolfe pit today I'm doing the fourth video on my fourth of July video series how to cook the perfect shish kabob so let's get started I'm going to start with a three and a half pound top sirloin roast and I'm going to remove most of the fat and then cut this up into bite-size pieces about this size you don't want the pieces to be too small or they'll dry out or too big for obvious reasons after trimming and cutting up the rows we have about three pounds of meat now I'm going to pour a whole bottle of zesty Italian dressing over one teaspoon of Italian seasoning and one teaspoon each of salt and pepper now I'm going to give this good thorough mix with my hands and then we're going to cover it and put it in the refrigerator for about an hour you don't wanna leave the meat in the Italian dressing much longer than an hour due to the acid in it it'll actually begin to cook the meat and it'll be mushy when you eat it now I'm not going to bore you so I'm only going to put one skewer together you can put these together any way you like I'd like to start off with a piece of meat and then an onion I don't like to marinate the vegetables so I just let the marinade off the meat marinate the vegetables that's enough marinade for the vegetables for me plus too much marinade is going to cause your vegetables to burn and again build the skewers how you like to eat them use whatever kind of fruits and vegetables you like now just continue building the skewers until you have the number you need now let these sit out for about 20 minutes like I've said before you don't want to grill cold meat have the grill done preheated to 450 degrees and we're going to grill these over direct Heat now I'm going to close the lid let these cook for about four and a half to five minutes per side now we're at the five minute mark so I'm going to go ahead and give these a turn after cooking for a total of ten minutes our shish kebabs are done and there you have it tender and juicy marinated shish kebabs thank you guys very much for watching I hope you stay tuned for the rest of the 4th of July video series hope you give this a try and I'll see you next time you
