 hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens what you want today's recipe request comes in from the Facebook user Stacie Walkley and she's asked me to make some cold cannon the irish classic and one of my favorites so let's get started so guys the first thing that we're going to do to get started on our cannon is cook our potatoes now I'm using two potatoes for this I'm using just ordinary white washed bleached potatoes but I'm also going to be using a sweet potato because I want the contrast of the two flavors now just into a large pot here I've got some boiling salted water and I'm gonna add in our potatoes and I've just cut them up into chunks now I want you to treat this like you're making mashed potatoes okay I want you to cook the potatoes through over this boil so it's a medium to high heat and we're going to cook this for about 8 to 10 minutes until those potatoes are nice and soft and we can mash them now guys once they mash them okay we want that real rustic sort of chunky look we don't want to smooth potato puree so that's where I want my potatoes done okay so I'm just gonna leave them in the bowl and let them cool down and while they're cooling down we'll get started on our cabbage and also on our milk mixture so with our cabbage what I'm gonna do is just cook it very very quickly because I still want to a cabbage to have some crunch to it so just into a pot of simmering salted water I've got some green cabbage here that I've just shredded up and this is only going to need about five minutes that's all over a medium heat here now over here on a smaller saucepan what I'm gonna be doing is making a milk and spring onion or scallion mixture so just into and here over medium heat I'm gonna be adding in some milk and just for some real fantastic flavoring and it will just all work when this is done I've got some ground nutmeg that I'm just going to add in to the milk and of course I've got some green spring green onions or some scallions that I'm just going to be adding to the milk as well for about three to four minutes over a high heat until that milks warm through and those green onions just to start to soften slightly so this is all our cabbage needs so I'm going to now drain this off the Heat's off and I'm gonna drain it now as you can see here our milk is starting to just boil around the edges now when that starts happening I've just got a knob of butter here and I'm just gonna place that in the middle and I want that to melt down and that's gonna give this milk mixture here with the spring onion a real creamy velvety texture so that is now done okay where it's exactly where we want it so we're going to turn the heat off now we can assemble our cold cannon so we've got everything here we've got our potato mash we've got our spring onion milk mixture and our cabbage just here so what I'm gonna do first is grab our cabbage and place it in our potato mix and then I'm going to pour over our milk and spring onion mixture and now I want you just to mix all that together so we've just got some chives in the middle and I want to sprinkle over some more spring onions or scallions just over the top so guys they have it there's my version of colcannon I absolutely love it and I love the way it looks it just looks with the chives and the spring onions like those potatoes are just still growing in the ground and you just want to get stuck into that cabbage the two types of potato and man that's one exactly what I'm gonna do right now it get stuck in so a real personal favorite of mine is called cannon I absolutely love it I had it so many times growing up as a kid and I've changed it over the years and this is my favorite take on it so here we go there's always such good flavors and that combination of the sweet potato the normal potato worked really well and it's just so tasty and Morris you just want more and more and more and you can have this as a meal by itself and if you really wanted to get creative with it add some bacon to it you know it'll just bring it alive again so there's so many different variations you can have it as a main meal or as a side dish it's up to you but in any case you've got to give this a try so cold cannon I hope you give this one a try it is so so good and I love it it's one of my personal favorites all the ingredients are below so check it out I'll see you this Friday for another fast food recipe so until then you take care
