 [Music] most of you know many mostly healthy lately and but today I'm really craving something fried I've never been to the England but every time I go to an English pub and I have the fish and chips they always taste really good you know being a southern boy anything fried is good but I've got some Cod today and we're gonna try to make some fish and chips let's see how it goes okay so we're gonna take our potatoes now when you do this it's not an exact measurement thing it's one of these things you make layers of potatoes and if you may if you're cooking these go ahead and cook something up extra and you can save them once they're done you just throw them the refrigerator they're fine for a day or two don't worry about it you're not gonna spoil so anyway this makes a perfectly cooked potato they're not soft enough for mashed potatoes they still have a little bite tool and if you follow this method I'm sure you'll be happy with it so and then you can use these potatoes for you can do baked potatoes with them you can fry them whatever so anyway you're gonna need a bunch of salt because what you're really salting is the water it's not an accurate thing and then they when they're done they still will need just a little bit of salt so just get some almost salty enough what we're gonna do we're gonna put water in here and we're gonna cover them at least 1 inch I'm gonna go about an inch and a half two inches on these these are a little bit bigger if use and they're real small potatoes you can go an inch three quarters of an inch something like that but what's gonna happen is whenever these are done boiling the mat the thermal mass is left from in the water and the potato I think will finish the cooking process now you do have to start this ahead of time because when we turn off the heat we're gonna let be set for two hours yes two hours gonna take time to get them to boil so you're looking at about two and a half hours to get these potatoes cooked anyway I'm gonna put them on stove now all right so I got them sitting on the stove I'm gonna take and put my burner on high and then we're gonna bring this to a boil all right see what we got going on here it's not a rolling boil but it's a real good simmer and I do have an electric stove so that burner is gonna stay hot for a while so I'm gonna do don't put this lid back on here as we want it to hold the heat turn the burner off and then we'll come back in about two hours okay so here it is two hours later we're a little more than two hours because it's not exactly a two-hour thing we're gonna pour this water off mix in a little cold water for the same that we've got all the water out of there we're just gonna let these things sit and cool down a little bit so I can handle them later so let's start on our batter I'm going to use one teaspoon of baking powder well I have 1 cup of self-rising flour in here we'll put 1 teaspoon baking powder because I want to make sure that this rises up and then I'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt in here and you can put more salt or less often how you like it but I'm keeping this kind of neutral we're gonna do after we mix this up a little bit we're gonna take and we're gonna put this in the refrigerator and let it get nice and cold that's gonna take about 10-15 minutes okay so we have cold flour cold bowl cold beer and I've got 1 cup of beer measured out here and it's gonna take a little more than that but it's 1 cup is a good starting point so everything's cold and then that's a freshly open beer it'll foam up so we're gonna give us a mix now depending upon your flour you may need to add more beer or you may not like this is looking pretty good all right now I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator well you know what quite mix there that's not as thick as I want last time I did this put a different flower I had to actually go to one one cup of flour and a one in the quarter cup of beer I'll put it a little bit of flour in there mix that there we go that's the thickness I'm looking for right there now we're gonna put this back in the refrigerator for about five minutes okay so now let's make our chips if you will now you got an option to peel these if you want to I'm not gonna do that today see that that's cooked you could eat that just like it is we're gonna take cut these in the big time on them in big pieces now if you wanted to peel these probably the easiest way to do it would be to take a spoon and peel them okay so my oil is coming up the temperature that's what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start dropping our potatoes in there and we'll start up putting some color on these things now you want to handle these pretty careful because they're fully cooked and they'll just break apart if you're not careful a little okay so my oils coming up the temperature that's what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start dropping our potatoes in there and we'll start up putting some color on these things now you want to handle these pretty careful because they're fully cooked and they'll just break apart if you're not careful with them and then whenever they're done do the color that you want just take them out put them on some paper towels it sprinkle a little salt on them right right then as soon as they come out of the oil toss them around in that salt a little bit and then continue cooking your next batch so when you finish cooking your chips take your fish be careful careful with it handle it gently dip it in your batter I remember everything's cold we're going to ease this into the oil all right so now we've cooked our fish on all sides make sure we got some nice color all the way around here's up the batter really good you can these little crunchy bits in here we're going to turn the heat off we're going to take our fish out there we go I'll plate this up and serve okay not being an Englishman never been in England I wonder how it did oh I know we're supposed to have a malt vinegar on this delicious track plane hmm potatoes are really good now that this is hot you know pork how does that look mm-hmm yeah
