 hey guys and welcome back to Catan Cracker Jacks today I'm going to show you how to make your very own pepperoni cheesy bites pizza the Pizza Hut way at home this pizza is super easy to make don't be fooled by you know thinking it's super hard it's not it's very easy if you can make a regular pepperoni pizza you can make this so for this recipe you're going to need some homemade pizza dough you could also use store-bought refrigerated if you'd like but I have a separate video that shows how I make my pizza dough I will put a link to that down below you're also going to need some shredded mozzarella cheese you're also going to need pizza sauce of course again you could use homemade or pre bought you're also going to need pepperoni or toppings of your choice some string cheese melted butter and garlic powder so let's get started I've already gone ahead and made up my pizza dough and I've covered that let it rise for an hour until it was doubled in size and now I'm going to place this on to a 16 inch pizza pan a lot of people have asked me on my previous Pizza videos where I get my pizza pans this is just a cheap $2 Walmart pizza pan it's made of aluminum it's super thin and lightweight which is exactly what you want for pizza because it lets the heat go right through the pan right to the crust so you get a nice evenly done crust but you want to Pat your pizza dough all the way out to the edges of your pan and I'm just using my fingertips to do this work around the dough evenly so it stays circular and you just want to Pat this out until it goes about a half inch or so beyond the edge of the pan because we're actually going to be folding the edges up and over a round cheese but once you get your crust spread all the way out you want to take some string cheese this is just the regular old individually wrapped string cheese that you can buy for like a quarter apiece go ahead and unwrap those I'm using 8 pieces for this 16 inch pizza you want to place those evenly around the edge of the crust and then you want to take the very edge of the crust and fold that up and over your cheese sticks and cap slighting then completely and once you get those completely encapsulated go around and press down the crust make sure that those edges are sealed so there's no air pockets or anything in there you want the dough wrapped tightly around the cheese tags then I'm going to take a knife and you can actually see where the individual sticks are you want to cut between the sticks and then cut each stick into three equal pieces it does not have to be perfect just eyeball this there's no need to get out of ruler and measure anything just eyeball it close enough is good enough for this and then to actually form the crown of cheesy bites if you will you just want to take each piece here and you want to pull it up and flip it 90 degrees when you turn these over make sure that that sealed side where the seam is of the dough stays on the bottom so that way when you bake it they stay sealed that they don't come undone and just go around and turn each of these pieces 90 degrees they don't have to be touching it's perfectly fine if there's space between them that's actually preferable because this dough will kind of rise and spread out as it bakes and now we can go ahead and build the toppings on our pizza I'm just going take my pizza sauce here again I will put a link that shows how I make that down below it's super simple it's tomato paste water basil oregano onion powder garlic powder little bit of salt I think but I'll put the recipe down below for that I'm using about a half a cup or so of sauce and just using the back of the spoon I'm going to spread an even layer of this all the way across the bottom of my pizza dough you want to make sure that that sauce goes all the way up to the edges of the pizza bites but don't go real heavy on this pizza sauce using too much sauce ends up making like a soggy crust that's not good so just use a thin layer and then I'm going to top this with some shredded mozzarella cheese now a lot of people ask me how I get my cheese will be melting on my pizzas the secret is I grate my own mozzarella cheese just by the block of low-moisture mozzarella cheese grated on a grater the pre shredded stuff has cellulose on it which kind of impedes the melt enos of the cheese so whenever you can if you if you're going to melt cheese by the block of cheese and shred it yourself but I ended up using about 6 ounces of cheese here you just want to spread that evenly again all the way to the edges of the cheesy bites and then I'm going to top my pizza with pepperoni you could use whatever toppings that you wish I'm just keeping it simple and use pepperoni when you do use pepperoni because pepperoni shrinks up in the oven when you bake it place your pepperoni slices close together almost overlapping them a little bit and go as heavy on the pepperoni as you want this is your pizza your time to make it how you want and then you want to bake your pizza in a preheated 450 degree fahrenheit oven and you want to bake this for about 12 minutes or so you want to bake it in tell the crust is nicely golden brown the cheese is nicely melted and it just starts to brown a little bit on the top and once everything is nicely golden brown you can go ahead and remove it from your oven and because I like soft and squishy bread especially with cheesy bites I'm just going to take a little bit of melted butter and using a pastry brush just brush the tops of these with butter that's going to make these cheesy bites nice and soft you don't have to do this if you don't want to but this is how I'm doing it but once I got that covered with the melted butter I'm just going to sprinkle a little bit of garlic powder right on top now if you were smart you would have mixed the garlic powder with the butter but I was not thinking when I made this so I'm just going to sprinkle a little garlic powder right on top but then go ahead and cut this into slices and serve it up but there you go that is how you make a cheesy bites pepperoni pizza the Pizza Hut way and if you wanted to you could substitute a hot dogs for the cheese and you can make yourself a hot dog bites pizza works the exact same way here's a picture of that for you and there you go impress your husband our wife
