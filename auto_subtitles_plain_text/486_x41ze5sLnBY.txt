 Eugenie kitchen hi I am Eugenie today I'm making deep-fried crispy onion wings it is perfect for an own play outside dish and a snake you can always find all my recipes at eugeniekitchen.com and don't forget to check out my Nespresso espresso giveaway for this summer first I will slice 1 onion 1/2 into C don't slice the thicker than this otherwise the onions 1 get cooked too thoroughly and separate them into wings in a mixing bowl add one and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour and coat the onion wings with flour using chopsticks or tones and cap to remove excessive flour then transfer to a wire rack over foil or parchment paper it's possible to skip this process but onion ring batter adheres to flour the onion batter then in a bowl of leftover flour add in 1/2 cup of an arch 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon of dried parsley dried oregano is also afraid and whisk to combine then crack an egg in a bowl and break it and in a bowl of dry mixture add in the egg and 3/4 cup of milk and whisk until homogeneous in the total dish throw in 3/4 cup of dried breadcrumbs or Japanese panko now code four or five onion rings in batter and transfer the batch to a wire rack to remove excessive batter and immediately move the batch to bread crumbs and coat even with bread crumbs now add the onion rings into vegetable oil it is easy to 365 degrees Fahrenheit for $185 just drop a little bit of batter into the oil and if it starts to cook with bubbles then it's ready to go and today in a deep heavy bottomed the pan I added about 2 inches of oil each easy now fry under squeeze it and golden for about 2 to 3 minutes now transfer to a wire rack over parchment paper or a paper towel line the tray and immediately sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste but if you had to talk in better the onion might sweat and the batter would fall off and if you're a fan of cheese like me trade your choice of cheese over onion rings parmigiano-reggiano would be great for me also I love onion rings with simple tomato ketchup or mayonnaise freshly fried breaded onion rings are so delicious see perfectly breaded crispy outside and tender inside I'm telling you all the fashion breaded onion rings are the past find more easy yet delicious recipes in my savory playlist thank you for watching bye
