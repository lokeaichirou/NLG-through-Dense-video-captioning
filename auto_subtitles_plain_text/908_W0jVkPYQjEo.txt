 everyone Brendan Kerr from The Art of Manliness calm in today's video Carl is going to show us how to grill a magnificent burger mwah okay we're going to do burgers a lot of times we've all been to parties we've had the dried out burger we've had the one that's burnt to a crisp today we're going to show you some basic tips to make the perfect burger and it all starts with the best hamburger 80/20 is what you want to go for so always find a butcher that if he can he he grinds his own hamburger but you want a ratio of 80% meat 20% fat that makes the perfect burger make the size divide it into the size burger you want and I think one of the most important things is don't overwork the burger when you're making the patty don't overwork it and again it doesn't have to be perfectly round there you want to try to just get it to the right thickness and again don't worry if it's got some splits or anything all that's fine and then the other trick I know everybody knows this guy his burgers come off they look like a football and then the first thing he does is he take his spatula slams it down the grill and all the juices come running out and he has a Vesuvian flare-up but what we like to do is we like to kind of trick the burger a little bit take make a little indentation in there so when it starts to cook it will even out to the other side of the burger and just like the steaks we're not going to over season the burger a lot of times you'll hear people say well what about adding other flavors into the burger onion breadcrumbs and egg well that's a meatloaf if you want to meatloaf cook a meatloaf we're cooking burgers here today and what we're going to do again with our olive oil and that olive oil not only imparts a little bit of flavor but it helps the salt and pepper to adhere to the meat but this will help you make the perfect burger fresh ground pepper on each one and we're ready to go to the grill okay we're ready to put our burgers on the grill again a screaming hot grill that's going to give us some good carmelization some good grill marks first thing we're going to do just like we did with the steaks we're going to oil our grill going to take our burgers and again just put them on the grill one thing about hamburgers unless you know where your meat is been ground whether it's freshly ground whether it's right out of the store you'll always want to cook a burger all the way through if it's freshly ground then you can cook it to temperature a medium rare medium burger is fine otherwise with the way hamburger is made you're better off being safe cooking all the way through which is in excess of 150 degrees Cal burger has been cooking about three or four minutes the key when you have burgers you only want to flip them one time you don't go back and forth back and forth back and forth we just want to flip them one time hopefully when we flip these things over there will be some good grill marks look at that that's exactly what we're trying to see and you can see how that well in there has kept the burger from fluffing up like a pillow so we've got some great grill marks that those are looking fantastic so a few more minutes on this side well toast the buns we'll put some cheese on we'll show you some tricks there as well all right you're ready got your grill you're ready to go your burgers are almost ready to take off one of my big pet peeves is when they make a cheeseburger and they don't take the extra 20 or 30 seconds it is to melt the cheese on the burger it makes all the difference in the world so we've got our burgers they're almost done we got our cheese all we got to do is take that cheese don't worry about it spilling over on the grill it'll all burn off just set that there now you don't want to do anything you don't want to touch it again we've only flipped our burgers one time close the grill we're going to come back in about 30-40 seconds that change is going to be perfectly melted ready for our buns okay finally one of the last things you've got to do we've got our burgers to cheese melting you got to toast the bun so a lot of people like it we lightly butter it we put it over here on a low to medium part of the grill and again you can leave it open it's not going to take long at all maybe fifteen to thirty seconds and you'll be able to take it off and that grill will be perfectly toasted have good grill marks ready to put your burger with the milk and cheese on it all right we're ready to take our burgers off look at that that is perfect first off let's check our bread
