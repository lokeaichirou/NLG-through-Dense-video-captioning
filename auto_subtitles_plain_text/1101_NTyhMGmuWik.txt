 Oh alright this recipe calls for a few things here first one is 2 onions 1 onion will be chopped up finely will be mixed in with 1 pound of hamburger meat and I have all the various spices over here that's going to complete this chili a Coney dog is nothing more but the hot dog frankfurter the chili sauce would just mustard and raw onions on top that is the original Coney Island and that's what we're doing here today so let's go ahead and get started by chopping up these onions like said you want a fairly fine and I have a little helper here that will help me make this short order it does a really good job just like that alright I got 1 pound of ground beef I'm away at in about half of these onions which would be about one whole onion these are the ones that I just chopped up rather fine and we're going to reserve two remainder of these onions for the hotdogs itself all right also into this I'm going to add two cloves of garlic that's been minced up don't stir all this in and brown well okay I've been going around 5 minutes just browning this meat up by the way this is a 93 7 93% lean 7% fat and all we're really coming up with is mainly water and so we're not going to drain this there will be a little bit of all in it a little bit grease but not enough to really hurt anything so at this point we're going to take 2 tablespoons of chili powder I'm using the next seen chili powder we're also going to put in 1 tablespoon of cumin that's two tablespoons of chili powder 1 tablespoon of cumin we're going to add this in we're going to let this cook about additional 3 minutes all right my add in about a cup of water also go ahead down one six out can of tomato paste all right I'm going to go ahead and work this in really good and get all this blended and mixed in well and we'll be back alright now I want to add in some salt we haven't seasoned it with salt we're going to get about a half a teaspoon of salt right now under this you want to add one tablespoon of just plain old yellow prepared mustard one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce we'll mix this in good all right the last and final ingredient is around 2 teaspoons of brown sugar maybe just a tad more that should be playing all right I'm gonna mix this in good we just won't let it simmer here for a few more minutes and this is basically done I've been letting this simmer for around five more minutes looking really good it's just about the right thickness just tasted it this stuff is good it's going to be really good on a chili dog alright what I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to slide this off the heat and I'm gonna swap places with this little steamer here we're going to go ahead and put this on high and we're getting ready to steam some hot dog wieners and some buns alright I've got these all beef New York style frankfurters going on got them steaming they've been in here about four minutes in about another minute I'm gonna add the buns and let them steam for one minute this is a very close replica to the original Coney Island the Coney Island dog up there in Michigan and from doing this hotdog series if I haven't learned anything I've learned one thing that there are many variations to all of these dogs the Detroit Coney Island it uses a thinner a thinner sauce this is a thicker sauce and I'm sure there's other variations as well different toppings such as that but what I presented to you today is the basic Coney Island recipe as it started but this Coney Island dog is about as simple as it gets we got a steamed bun nice and salt from there we're gonna take the New York style all beef kosher type hot dog Wiener right now from here we're something just gonna put this chili on that we made - what that really looks good smells good and tastes good all right all we get from there is just more mustard on top you know we got mustard and saw the chilli we're going to put more on top we're going to top it with raw onions and that is it that is the Coney Island all right oh this is going to be good let's give this a taste test all right here we go mmm oh yeah mmm it's very hot but delicious this is the keeper this is good all right people this is actually going to be my last hot dog in this series for a while I will be adding some more hot dog recipes as I go and throw them on that playlist but I have got so many products that I've got to do reviews on that people's been sending me and Melanie and I'm really getting behind so it's time for me to move on to bigger and better things so I hope you enjoyed everything up to now I've got four different hot dog videos up and we covered some really good ones I hope you give them a try including this one this is a keeper for sure excellent hot dog and that's about it until next time smoker ribs
