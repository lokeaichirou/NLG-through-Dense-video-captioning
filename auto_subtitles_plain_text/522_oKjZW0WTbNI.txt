 I wrote a welcome to Nicko's kitchen once again today on fast food Friday one of my favorite salads we're going to be making a walled-off salad so the first thing that we're gonna do is start one of two dressings and the first dressing that we're going to make is our in a great for our Waldorf salad so start off with some olive oils our white wine vinegar a Dijon mustard and just season it with pepper and salt and just give that a good whisk around okay so the first dressings done now we're gonna start on our second so now for our mayonnaise dressing so I just want to put in some mayonnaise straight in and the juice of one lemon and just give that a good mix through and guys just put that aside and we're gonna get started on the rest of our salad now I'm going to do my apples first so just using at Quora just go straight through now I'm going to leave the skin on with these okay I'm not going to peel them because I really like the red color in the salad from these apples if you wanted to you could use green apples but I find red ones work the best and just cut the apples into quarters and then cut them in half again now guys I've got some celery stalks here as well I just want to cut them up into small slices now guys I've got some walnuts here as well now you can chop them up if you want them smaller than that but I actually like the size that they are so I'm just going to leave them plus it's a lot more convenient just to put them straight in as they are so I've got our apples in a bowl and I'm going to add in our walnuts and celery and once you've got the mixture in the bowl guys I'm going to add in our vinaigrette and just mix those apples and the celery in the walnuts and get it all coated with that dressing so guys I've got some cars letters here okay now you can use any lettuce that you want if you want to use an iceberg go for it it's whatever you've got what again I just find that the hulls lettuce works really well so just give it a good wash just cut off the end because they can be a little bit bitter and just place them in a bowl now I'm just going to spoon over our warmer apple and celery mix and lastly I just want to drizzle over our mayonnaise dressing and there you have a guy's my version of the classic Waldorf salad is absolutely sensational trust me so healthy and all the textures and flavors are there you've got the crunchiness of the walnuts and the celery the sweetness of the Apple the Tanous of that mayonnaise and lemon and then of course you've got that white wine vinaigrette with the olive oil and all the other great things that were in there and it's just beautiful the mustard it's awesome and it's healthy so give this a go so let's give this a try [Music] all the ingredients are below the page just click for more info and give this a go you guys take care and I'll see you on Monday for the mystery Monday so make sure you get your ingredients list in to me [Music]
