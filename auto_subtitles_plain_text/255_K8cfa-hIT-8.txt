 nobleton ha ha hi this is sister to funky coming to you live at cafe 70 at the Museum of uncut funk today I'm going to prepare for you my version of food on noodle soup so what I have here before me are my ingredients I have one sliced carrot and what I have here our broccoli leaf stems now use the leaves for another recipe but I've always saved my broccoli stems because they're filled with a lot of nutrients and why throw them out when you could use them for stews and soups and to add extra flavor quote to whatever dish that you're cooking I have here a sliced red pepper some chopped shitake mushrooms my mood on noodles I have a tablespoon of ginger and four garlic cloves i also have a roasted turkey breast that i have slice and i'm going to add to my soup and for my base the flavoring i'm going to use a chicken stuff towards the end of my male 1 I place it in the bowl I'm going to chop my scallions and put them on top and I have here some low-sodium soy sauce just to add more flavor so what I'm going to do is put my base in a pot of boiling water and then I'm going to start to add my ingredients okay i have my pot of boiling water i'm going to add two packets of chicken stock to my water and i actually have been here four cups of water and i'm adding two packets of chicken stock now while that is boiling and the chicken start starts to dissolve i'm going to add my for shocked Carla our clothes and my one tablespoon of ginger I'm going to mix that around ok now I'm going to start to add my vegetables to this mixture because I'm not going to let them cook very long they're going to cook for about two to three minutes I want them to be fork tender but I don't want them to be mushy so I'm going to take my carrots and i'm going to add those into this mix i'm going to take my broccoli leaf stems and i'm going to add that going to mix this around over there i'm going to add my red pepper sliced red pepper and my chopped shitake mushrooms ok now i'm going to put a cover on this let this come to a boil and come back in two to three minutes now that I have all of my vegetables in the pot I'm going to let this boil for about a minute or two again I want my vegetables to be a fork tender and I'm going to get a cover let this boil and then when I come back and want to add my noodles and my roasted turkey and let that get warmed in the broth with the vegetables and we'll have lunch ok so our soup has been boiling for about two minutes I'm going to take the cover off I'm going to reduce the heat under there so it could be at a nice simmer now what I'm getting ready to do is I'm going to add my food on noodles to this mixture just put them in just like that now once the noodles go in this is not going to take long to cook because the noodles are already cooked for you so basically you're just warming them up in your stock and vegetables so I'm going to mix the vegetables around make sure the noodles get covered with the bra and then I'm going to take my slice roasted turkey and I'm going to place that right on top like this and allow the turkey to get warm you can push some of those pieces down like that and you can add more turkey or less turkey more vegetables less vegetables whatever you choose to do so I'm going to let this boil simmer for about another minute and then when we come back I'm going to put some in a bowl and we're going to have lunch udon noodle soup for lunch today okay our soup has been simmering I'm going to turn this out and as you can see it's nice and hot so I am going to take my tongs and put some of these noodles mix this up a little bit put some of these noodles in my bowl be very careful taking this out because you know they're thick noodles and you want to be able to get everything in the bowl so i got my littles in the bowl I'm had some vegetables some of the carrots oops some of the broccoli stems and some of the mushrooms get all of that goodness in here and put some of the roasted turkey right on top and then i'm going to get my ladle and make sure i get some of the broth in here and when you're getting the broth you can also scooped up some of those vegetables that are on the side there an tastic now you know if I didn't mention it before you can get food on noodles from your local Asian supermarket if you have one in your community so as I've got my soup in here I'm going to come over here and get some of these scallions and sprinkle them right on top we cover my soup to make sure it stays nice warm and I have my spoon here now you can add a little soy sauce on top of this if you'd like it's not necessary I personally think there's enough flavor going on in here where I for myself will not add any on soy sauce so I'm going to taste this broth mmm that's delicious you get the hint of the shitake mushrooms you can taste the ginger the garlic and this is just really a really good light and easy suit to make any time of the year so I hope you try this recipe I'm going to finish having my lunch here and i'll see you next time Thunder man aboard
