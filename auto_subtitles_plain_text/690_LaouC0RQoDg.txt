 hey guys welcome back to episode 3 of wedding least kitchen three new comments in my previous video and a lot of you wanted this recipe and I made this recipe before on my blog channel and ever since then you guys have been asking for it and also I saw some comments that you guys wanted like a vegetarian dish this is not a vegetarian because I did put chicken in it but if you want to have it vegetarian style just take out the chicken this recipe is super easy to make it's probably the easiest one you will see ever it takes about 20 minutes including prep and cook time well 25 what I'm making today is called Mapo tofu and I'm using this sauce package right here as I said in my previous video basically every one of these recipes in this series is going to be really easy you can definitely make this from scratch but I'm just using the packet sauce because this tastes so good it's just a lot faster to make in Chinese this is cod Mapo tofu which is a very popular try this dish it's popular I don't know most like children and older people older people seniors if you're Chinese or you grew up in an Asian family you've probably had this before it it's just a very safe dish for almost everyone you can either buy it in the milder version or the hot version but this is the spiciest it gets and I don't even think it's that spicy sea and you can handle a bag of hot cheetos you can handle this actually this is not even as spicy as a bag Macchio's so like I said this recipe is super easy island with no wine making a tutorial on it because the instructions are just on the back of this box it's so simple it will take you 20 to 25 minutes to prepare and bake let me know in the comments if you guys do decide to try out this recipe and let's get started [Music] so for Mapo tofu you're actually supposed to use silky tofu but this is the one I have and I didn't want to go out and buy another pack of tofu so I'm using firm which is fine you can use it too but traditionally it's cooked with silk tofu it really depends how much you want to use I'm gonna use the whole block today because I want some leftovers and now it's really up to you how you want to cut your tofu I like to have them in little cubes the thing I like about firm tofu is that it's much easier to cut but still tofu I'm like you don't wanna break it [Music] and now I'm just gonna cut up the green onion into little dices this is basically just for garnishing it doesn't really taste like anything when you put it in the tofu but I just like to use it to garnish and now just cut your onion this is just for the chicken so you need a really tiny bit I'm just gonna use about that much and dice it [Music] for the ground chicken you can use ground pork ground beef it's up to you but I love chicken so I'm gonna use chicken and you're gonna want to use a big knife like this if you don't then I would suggest you go get one because you can use these but these just aren't the best for like grounding meat or if you have a food processor use that so to make it a little easier for myself I'm just gonna cut them into small pieces first and then if you live in an apartment this is not apartment friendly but it's okay don't worry about the neighbors [Music] here's my second fillet I'm just gonna put it in this bowl and go marinate it so marinating this is super simple you don't even have to do it but I like to do it just because I want my chicken to have a little flavor I'm just using some garlic salt onion powder and black pepper after you have that just mix it together with your spoon or you can use your hands [Music] it's time to cook the chicken add a little bit of oil put your onions in and turn on your fan just adding your chicken okay now that your chicken is soft just set it aside on a plate [Music] time to cook the tofu oily oily just add in your sauce the tofu comes in a packet like this kind of like hamburger helpers and you're just going to rip it open and ask the whole packet right now I'm using firm tofu so it's not gonna break them easily but if you're using silk tofu just be very gentle because you don't want to break your tofu and my way of cooking this is to scoop from underneath that way you're not stabbing and breaking any of the tofu so go from underneath and liquid like your dirty underwear my chicken for green onions you want to wait till the last minute because they cook really fast so just wait till the end and throw those into garnish so it's pretty much ready I'm gonna add my green onions and it's ready just turn off the stove and put this on a bowl all right guys thank you so much for watching this episode and if you guys do decide to recreate any of my recipes please use the hashtag cook for mom and Whaley to show me your pictures I would
