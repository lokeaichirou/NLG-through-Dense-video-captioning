 great welcome to the simple Cooking Channel today I'm going to show you my recipe for crumbed calamari rings [Music] right for the crumb mix I use half a cup of breadcrumbs a quarter of a cup of corn flake crumbs you can buy it in a packet already made or you can just get some corn flakes and crush them you know a sealed plastic bag and a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese and just mix it all together so you get your calamari and you just dip it straight in the flour now what I do with my calamari first and it's optional is I just let it sit in some sweet chili sauce for about half an hour just to give it a little kick and straighten you know strating the crumb mix just set it aside on a plate and just repeat that process over with calamari rings they're ready to go so let's start cooking so what we do is put the heat on low to low medium and put in some butter margarine or some oil whatever it is that you usually use right now we'll just chuck in the calamari going young now calamari doesn't take long to cook at all really just three or four minutes so basically after about two minutes or so turn them over all right those are don't turn the heat off just let them sit there for 30 seconds or so well I hope you enjoyed my recipe for crammed calamari Cheers that's really good I'll see you next time my next meal [Music]
