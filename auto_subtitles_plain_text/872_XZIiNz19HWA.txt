 welcome to half our meals calm I'm here with Jared wood of sushi by Jared and he's going to show us how to make a California roll what we're gonna do is put on our gloves sesame all on our fingers again the reason why we're using sesame oil on our gloves is it infuses really really well into the rice I'm gonna grab our nori sheets we're gonna grab our little ball of rice just a nice little palm full we replace two right in the middle of the nori and we're just gonna work our ways cover this nori sheet and get all those edges covered thin it a little bit correct you just want to make sure that you're not they're not changed in the consistency of the rice that you've worked so hard to create next step is always sesame seeds sesame seeds yep toasted sesame seeds okay so now we're gonna grab our mats or mats I take our mats here and this time we're gonna put the rice facing down the rice is facing down the mount always taped down we're gonna grab some crab crabby this crab meat is a sushi grade crab meat it's called a sea stick this one is used with real king crab juices so now we got our pieces of crab we're just gonna put those on to the rule what I what I tend to do is I visually look at a wall I tend to try and keep my product closer to me right it just allows better when you're pulling it together to get that seal that you need I see so we're just gonna add some some cucumbers that we cut before and we're gonna add some avocado so we grab this avocado I'm gonna go a little bit thicker and just when you're cutting the avocado you don't need to use a lot of pressure let your blade just slowly go through the avocado to get the cuts that you want what we're gonna do is you're gonna take your four fingers and use our thumbs in behind now this is this is where it gets a little bit tricky this is we're gonna have to make sure that you're forcing that in not using a lot of pressure that it's squeezing out the ends and give it a fold over just to get back soon feels alright not bad oh all right now we're just gonna go one two so fingers up in the corner again just lift it up grab with your right hand four fingers in front thumb behind one two Wow okay ready voila look at that it's amazing so put our Matt flip it back over right put it to the end and just kind of work that down there again you don't have to use a lot of pressure just feeling how the product inside your hand and I condensed this everything together there yep right in the middle sometimes you get a bad cut you can just remove that that's for yourself no problem and through don't have to push let the blade do the work and check this out little bum here go Cheers formulas calm [Music] [Applause] [Music]
