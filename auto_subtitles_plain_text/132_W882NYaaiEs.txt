 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make my world-famous mac and cheese it's so simple and easy it's not the kind of mac and cheese you get out of a box it is so Hardy and delicious gooey gooey full of cheeses are just delicious but before we get started it means go over the ingredients you'll need some pasta and I'm choosing to use my corkscrew pasta whole milk that's been warned some grated cheddar whole milk mozzarella freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano some bread crumbs some flour pancetta butter and you're also gonna need tiny bit of olive oil and salt and pepper very simple and easy and this is so delicious now I make mine with 3 different kinds of cheeses and I'm my favorites are the combination I'm using today which is sharp cheddar mozzarella and parmigiano why because the sharp cheddar has a lot of really sharp tangy flavor the mozzarella just melts into the most delicious early gooey texture and the parmigiana is a really nice nutty flavor so I think it makes a great combo but you can use whatever you want if you want to use Swiss Gruyere please by all means do that I don't use Swiss only because I think it's a little too strong and it overpowers everything else so that's why I'm choosing this combination now I make mine with some cubed up and then sauteed pancetta it is so delicious pancetta is pretty much the Italian version of bacon except it's not smoked you can find it pretty much in any supermarket nowadays but if you can't find it you can always substitute with bacon and you kind of want to chop it up into nice small pieces okay first thing you Adam get you up into 400 get that ready second thing you wanna do is get a big pot fill it with water nice sprinkling of salt get that to come up to a boil for your pasta now we need to head over to the stove so we can make our bechamel and saute up our pancetta I've added my past that's my boiling water and while that cooks we're going to work on the pancetta and the bechamel now have a little scaler here with about less than a tablespoon of olive oil probably about a teaspoon and a half and to that I'm going to add my pancetta I want to do is just let this cook until it's nice and crispy I'll take about three to four minutes let that go and now in this pan over medium-high heat I'm adding my butter and I'm letting the butter melt now looks good I'm going to add in my flour and I'm just going to keep stirring this until it all comes together and I'm going to cook it for about a minute so it gets rid of that raw flour taste and it doesn't taste like glue it tastes like a nice cook true just keep stirring otherwise it'll stick now to that I'm going to add my milk just doing it really slowly and whisking the whole time we're stirring us today because I'm just trying to avoid any lumps so just add all of your milk little by little now that I added all my milk you make sure it's nice and smooth so I have to stir it for about a minute you want to cook this until it's nice and thick which will take about three to four minutes and also the contact that's perfectly cooked I turn it off and now I'm just going to drain it onto just a little a plate and then we're going to finish assembling the whole thing my bechamel looks perfect but now I need to be seasoned we're just going to season with black pepper my mother would have a heart attack at this point at this point because she likes to use white pepper in her bechamel but she's not here today so I'm going to use black pepper some salt not too much salt only because we have this plaster that's already been seasoned with salt and we're adding so many cheeses and the pancetta that it doesn't really need it I'm then going to add my grated sharp cheddar my grated mozzarella this whole milk mozzarella melts beautifully and half of the parmigiano and I'll show you why and when you're doing half and I'm just going to stir this all together because this is really hot until all the cheese's have melted beautifully that looks absolutely gorgeous now I'm going to just take my pasta that I drained and I've let this cook until it's nice and al dente actually a little bit shorter you know a little bit less than al dente only because it's going to be in the oven for a little bit and I want to overcook it I'm then going to add my creamy cheese sauce I think it's plenty chew my pasta and I'm just going to mix it all together with a punch it down just mix it all up like so I'm just putting this into my casserole dish trying to get it all out don't leave anything behind just kind of even it out I mean admittedly this is a very rich dish I'll admit that but this is not the kind of thing I eat every day and I'm certainly not suggesting how you eat this every day but once in a while you just crave some comfort food and this is perfect I've just put a little bit more sauce over the top it's gorgeous I love that look I am then going to top it with some bread crumbs and this is going to give you such a nice crispy topping Oh probably my favorite part of this dish and then the remaining by my channel just evenly over the top that looks just gorgeous makes like a really crispy crust and then I'm going to drizzle it with just a touch of olive oil just to help the bread crumbs kind of Brown up wonderful now this is going to go into your preheated oven 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is nicely golden brown and then we'll die eat it what else is it adieu I took my mac and cheese out of the oven and this just baked for about 25 minutes so the top is nice and golden and it looks incredible it smells even better I let this cool for about five minutes only because I don't have the willpower to let it wait once it's on my plate so oh look at that crust you see that look at the cheesy sauce ah this is a dinner for champions I tell you serve this with a simple green salad and you have got a great steam great dinner ha hmm it's super creaming it's so nice and tangy from all the different cheeses makes such a great blend dip uncheck that puts it over the top but this crust right here ah yeah it's so delicious I guarantee you once you make this mac &amp; cheese you will never ever buy a box of mac and cheese ever again there's no need to you can make it from scratch you can make it in no time it's super simple and easy I mean if I can do it you can do it and that's it I mean you saw it and it's incredible I'm telling you just serve this along with a simple salad and you have a fantastic dinner to share with your loved
