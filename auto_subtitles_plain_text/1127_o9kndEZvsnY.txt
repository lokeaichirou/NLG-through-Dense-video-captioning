 hi welcome to Eddie's another survival skill video and today we are going to be cooking food on noodles and we are going to take it to another level not just adding soup flavoring but some cuttlefish balls and some Chinese bok choy and leave your little nick vegetable with it so let's start by showing you how we prepare and clean bok choy I like to cut off the ends so this way we could easily wash them cleanly because all the dirt is in the base of the the bok choy which is separate it I already pre wash all of all of this so for sake of saving time now and let's move on to food on noodles you can pick up many of these type of food on noodles in just about every grocery store under the Sun so we open this up and put it time order to see to see your time I really pre open any of five of them and here we go I have already started a pot of water here and in this pot of water I have added a can of chicken broth so I don't have I don't have to I don't have to use so much of the soup flavoring that it comes in a package but I will add for the sake of flavoring that it's for this type of noodles I will add about maybe a couple packs of this and you see this is so simple and it will come very close to what you'll find in a typical Japanese restaurant here where we had in our our fish balls you could add any other type of meat but this comes closer to a lot of the Asian flavoring and we'll let that ball just a little bit since this could takes a little bit longer to cook I'll let this cook a little bit first before I add in the vegetables now like I've said earlier we don't have to use bok choy we could just use any clothes and vegetable and it'll work just fine we get a little bit here however much that you want to make I'm making almost I'm making five servings here so it just comes up to a boil and just a minute I am going to start to at Fudan noodles and we don't want to boil the udon noodles too long otherwise they lose all their texture in the way they're supposed to be so let's start adding them down who knows Circle Lotus a little bit for understimated a lot of soup that I originally put in there this all take some of it out Oh some of those vets going and let that come up to a boil a little bit and we are gonna and we're done so you could get some of the noodles start separating them a little bit as you could see we're cooking very nicely [Music] so this does Potter noodles beemo serve five cost fifty cents a pack on the noodles to as much as eighty cents a pack the vegetable costs about a dollar we can't including account of chicken broth and that typically is about a dollar and in the and the fish balls are about three bucks for the pack and if you do the math this is I would guesstimate somewhere under ten bucks and we're going to serve at what pot of noodles that was certified people so that's what you call survival skills save a lot of money by
