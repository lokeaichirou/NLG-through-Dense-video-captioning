 welcome to the poor man's gourmet kitchen where we share gourmet recipes and a little much wonder now check this up the first thing you want to do is butterfly your shrimp just take a sharp knife down the backside of the shrimp just the same way you would devein it go 3/4 of the way through and fan it open like this as you can see front back are still intact now here we've got our tenpura and our coconut all take their shrimp and we'll dip it straight in the tempura now I've made it a little bit thicker than normal if you don't know how to make that then just click the link here on the left but after you get it completely soaked just drift dry it and dip it in your coconut on all sides and make sure it's completely covered now just on a side note having a thicker tempura allows you to get more coverage of the coconut and it keeps you from having to use panko to fill the spaces and that's it that's how it looks once you get enough of them done and you've covered a plate you can move to the frying just a hot pan and some oil and then they go have about a quarter inch of peanut oil anymore that's all you'll need for the prime know it takes a couple minutes per side you may need to add more oil in between each batch but that's okay that's completely normal now you want to do is just flip them get your cover on each side and when I completely cook just plate it on some paper towels like this I will absorb all the remaining oil fat that you want to get rid of before you start chewing on the shrimp I like to use borns chili sauce for the dipping sauce and it just comes in a bottle so it's real convenient to just purchase an Asian section and there you have it coconut shrimp right here in the poor man's gourmet kitchen thank you for watching and be sure to stop by poor man's gourmet kitchen com for more recipes and exact ingredients
