 alright guys today we're gonna make some meatloaf I've had people ask me to do a meatloaf recipe for a while now meatloaf there is all types of recipes out there I'm gonna show you one of the ways I do it for my recipe we're gonna need some ground beef I'd recommend a pound and a half to two pounds if you're gonna be feeding you know four to six people if you're only gonna be feeding one or two people you can go with a pound I'm just gonna be making a pound this will feed actually up to four people really but really you know it's if you want a big serving just like two or three people for a pound we're gonna make a sauce for the top of it and in my sauce I add a little bit of maple syrup some people use brown sugar I choose to use a little bit of maple syrup ketchup of course a little bit of mustard I'm gonna use some Grey Poupon that's what I have at home but you can use almost any type of mustard a little bit of mousse to show your sauce for the meatloaf itself we don't need all that much we just need the meat the ground beef we need an egg if you're doing two pounds or a pound and a half or more you could use two eggs I'm doing a pound here so just keep in mind I'm using a pound if you want to make more than a pound just you know add a little bit more of each ingredient I'm using about a half a cup of finely chopped onion which mines frozen I gotta let it defrost a little bit here and then chop it up you need some stuffing mix or bread crumbs I prefer some stuffing mix need some milk and some salt and pepper so let's go ahead here and first make the sauce alright for our sauce ketchup of course is always used in meatloaf we're gonna use about five to six tablespoons of ketchup so let's go ahead here the first one was kind of half emptied out so that's one six there then about four tablespoons maple syrup and I really recommend you get real 100% maple syrup as you can see here the ingredients just maple syrup that's it if you go ahead and get some cheaper other type of syrup look at the ingredients on this and as you can see there's tons of ingredients there that's not as good you want to use 100% pure maple syrup if you can so 4 tablespoons of this and that about two tablespoons of mustard so we'll go ahead here something I'm just gonna estimate with the mustard cuz I have to scoop this out my spoon already has stuff in it something's gonna estimate about two tablespoons and then one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and I'm just gonna guesstimate again now go ahead and stir that all up and this is gonna be the sauce that we use at the end to cover up the meatloaf and give it a nice top to taste it's gonna be a really nice sweet but also flavorful sauce so you end up with something like that so now let's go ahead and make the meatloaf okay so now for the meatloaf I'm gonna be using 1 pound of ground beef get that out there and then we're gonna be using 1 egg also gonna be using a half a cup of ketchup now I'm gonna estimate guys like do this a lot but measure it if you want half a cup of ketchup and a half a cup of milk again I'm estimating guys but if you want to measure it go ahead and then about a cup of breadcrumbs or stuffing mix probably about good and then throw in your onions about 1/2 cup of finely chopped onions and then we're gonna want about a teaspoon or so of salt and just a little bit of pepper so I'm just gonna estimate this about a teaspoon of salt and then just like a quarter to a half teaspoon pepper and then this you could stir up don't stir it too long I'm gonna just mix it up with my hands kind of nasty so I'm gonna go to the sink after I'm done with this but I find that with my hands I can get everything mixed in really good rather than with a spoon that just kind of mixes it around this way I'm kind of getting all the breadcrumbs and everything mixed in really good so yeah I'm gonna dirty hands but I'll just wash them after so don't stir it or mix it too much it'll get shook combined and you might start breaking up everything right it too much so this is looking good now all we do get my pan here now all we do is take it put it in the pan and kind of shape it and now you want to have your oven heated up to 350 and we're gonna cook it for about an hour and then what we're gonna do is add this topping on mostly later about 15 minutes before it's done cooking we're gonna add most of this on but I'm just gonna put a tiny bit on now not too much just to get some of that flavor going through there but we're gonna top it off later with the majority of the sauce ten minutes before it's done cooking so now we're gonna put it in a 350 degree oven for about an hour and at about 45 to 50 minutes we're gonna take it out and put on that extra seasoning so let's go ahead and throw it in the oven all right so here we go got my meat loaf preheated to 350 degrees and put it in there for 45 minutes like I said and then we'll come back with 15 minutes left and throw that extra two topping on all right guys they're cooking for 45 minutes so now we got 15 minutes left we have a total hour cook time now remember I'm cooking one pound of beef if you were cooking a pound and a half or two pounds you'd probably want to cook this for about an hour of 15 minutes to a to an hour and a half of the most Raleigh so put the majority of this time I might not use it all because I've got plenty here it looks like try to get it down the sides I'll use a little more get it down the sides and all over and I'll throw it back in for the last 15 minutes and there we have it after about an hour of cooking we have the meatloaf duck meatloaf done I'm going to give it a second to cool off and then cut off a piece and see how it turned out and here we go here's our finished product as you can see it's cooked fully through now if you want you can use an oven thermometer and you can get precise reading you want this to be a hundred and sixty degrees in the middle so if you have a thermometer then you could test it out I'll just go ahead and taste it here see how it turned out it's probably really hot still no it's really good really good that top glaze tastes so good on there so easy recipe there guys pretty simple to make not too many ingredients it turns out great every time you could save this for a few days and microwave it and it's always real good so if you have any questions let me know we'll see you guys later happy cooking
