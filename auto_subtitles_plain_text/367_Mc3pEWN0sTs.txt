 today on the foot wash we're gonna make Vietnamese sandwiches hi everyone I'm really craving for some Vietnamese food and feel a little bit homesick so in this video I'm going to show you how to make these flavorful and delicious sandwiches are you excited me too let's get started first of all for the preparation let's begin with a pulse marinade will finely chopped 1 ration oats you can also meet some cloths correct but this time I wanna stick with red shallots well a lot of shallots in large mixing bowl put in the chopped red channet one and a half tablespoon of white sugar 1 and 1/2 tbsp fish sauce 2 or 3 tbsp our sauce one teaspoon five-spice powder a little bit black pepper and about half tablespoon oil using a spoon Nestle mix all the ingredients together and superbunny to make a smooth and flavorful marinade after that gently put the pump in the marinade flip them so both sides will be beautifully coats we will leave them there for at least 15 minutes before cooking to let them absorb all the stunning flavors oh and don't throw away the marinade we'll use it later okay meanwhile for the veggies cut a medium cucumber lengthwise and thinly slice it we will also slice two small terrors in the same size with a cucumber normally I'm not really a huge fan Tara but it actually tastes pretty good in sandwiches so hands down this time anyways after slicing on the veggies transfer them to a tray or bowl add 2 tbsp white sugar 2 tbsp vinegar and also season with a pinch of salt and we will miss them all together and set aside for at least 30 minutes before serving for the bread since I'm such a lazy and terrible Baker and inside to pick out this premium read at the supermarket everything we have to do is baking them in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes until the surface turns golden brown you can also use a French baguette venemous bread or any car bread of your choice now heat a frying pan over medium-high heat put in 1 tbsp oil and pan fry the pork until nice little floor and aromatic well after this bed not only the part but even myself smell pretty delicious let them cool down a little bit and thinly slice them my crazy slicing technique though I always used my chopstick to hold the meats way much faster than using glows bright put our frying pan back to the heat remember I tell you not to throw away the marinade now it's time to make something delicious from it pause the marinate into the pan followed by some tbsp fresh water gently stir to combine and bring it to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer for couple minutes so thicken it a little bit this will be our sandwich sauce if you find it too salty feel free to taste and adjust the water and sugar when it reached the desired the nest turn of the heat and transfer to us mumble and of course don't forget a delicious and intriguing breath every ingredient is ready and here comes the most interesting part to assemble this Vietnamese sandwich first of all we will spread a little bit butter to give it that buttery rich and flavor now carefully I rent a cucumber slice followed by the carrot ones after being sucked in the sugar vinegar mixture they will be really crunchy and yummy after that boost some marinade miss slice on top of the veggies and finally ladder our sauce all over the filling just yummy pretty simple right so did you remember on the steps spread butter I ran the veggie slice put some mixed nuts on top and ladder the sauce you'll note it trust me and Tara here our final result color phone and trimming and mouth-watering Vietnamese sandwiches have fun making them and I will see you in next video Bon Appetit
