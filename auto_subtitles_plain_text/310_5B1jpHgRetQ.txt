 hi I'm Matt scre from Markos kitchen I run Japanese cooking classes and catering in London I'm going to show you how to make a miso soup first of all you're going to make a dashi stock so let me explain about ingredients for making a dashi stock so this is kombu is a kelp you can see some white bits on the surface it's not dust or any mold anything just them it came up the minerals came out of kombu and then are we going to use it for just soaking them in a water half now put the kombu in the water cold water no heat just I'll leave it on for half an hour so now you see the kombu start swelling up and then we start boiling with high heat better you don't boil the kombu the kombu gets slimy and then a bitter flavor go to the water so just stand before it start boiling we take the combo out okay so in the meantime we got some what calm is sea read so we soak or comment in the water for 10 minutes to reconstitute for for the miso soup we're going to have another ingredients so what comment and tofu dice tofu so when it's just before its start boiling take the condo out so kombu it's just yet so swollen up and then becomes bit more slimy so put it away and when it start boiling reduce the heat then we put cuts over che okay it's a handful of cuts off she going to the kombu dashi stock you just simmer only two minutes after 2 minutes infusing the flavor of the katashi to the water we strain the dashi stock now we have dashi stock kombu and cut so she does she stuck here and will comment it's been reconstituted so you see quite nice green color of the becoming so we just strain a water so now the dashi stock start boiling then we aren't tofu to heat it up and the last thing just some dissolving the missile in the stock suit by using this tool so 1 tablespoon about this much for one portion of 200 hundred milliliter of the dashi stock or stock soup so we have about 4 tablespoons of missile dissolve another she stock okay so now you see the grains of soya beans and then a miso paste dissolved in the dashi stock okay so after you dissolve the miso in a dashi stock you're not going to boil this miso soup the other wiser flavor will be gone so after you add miso turn the heat off then serve so we're coming we don't cook the put a quick double comment it's just keep preserve the color of nice green color so you put in the miso soup cup then pour the soup and tofu into the cup and then sprinkle some chives on top okay so that's how to make Japanese miso soup
