 hello friends are milta from hobby chef and I'm not giving you recipe which is dal makhni the literal meaning of the term l don whistles pulses or lentil and mclean means very buttery so it's kind of a buttery mental preparation come let's have a look at the ingredients first I have taken half cup of hooded armatures this black lentils and a handful of red kidney beans I soaked them overnight and drain the water and this is what it comes as so now we will check out the other ingredients you need salt to taste coriander powder 2 tbsp red chilli powder half teaspoon and if you prefer it more you can add more cumin seeds 1 4 TSP half cup of milk clarified butter or ghee 2 tbsp butter 2 tbsp this is nutmeg I've taken the whole nutmeg here but I'll grade the nutmeg and put a pinch of the grated nutmeg in the dish this is what I have done I have taken three medium sized tomatoes and three to four cloves of garlic and maiden made it into a puree now have a look at this this is a masala Turkey which I have bought from jammu and it's a very good product I use this for making my dal makhani rajma and many other gravies but if you don't have this you can add half teaspoon of garam masala ok now let's start cooking first of all he table spoon of clarified butter that is ghee in a pan let it heat up then we add our cumin seeds ok now I'm omitting one step here because I have heard this lovely masala Turkey otherwise Oh what you can do is for the same flavor take two whole red chillies dried and three cloves of garlic soak them in water for 10 to 15 minutes then grind it into a fine paste after putting the 01 sit crackles you can put that paste and cook nicely till the oil separates in our cumin seeds are crafty late because of knots ardennes Artemis chili paste I'll and directly my far into it because i have taken half cup of dark i'll add five times that is two and a half cups of water after adding two and a half cups of water I'll close the lid of pressure cooker put your gas on high flame and let one whistle come after the first whistle lower the flame owns them and keep it up on the flame for 15 to 20 minutes okay now 15 minutes has been over since fear cooking ah huzzah I switched off the gap okay though I've added the tomato cutie to that may take the garlic puri to dal and i started my gas again we will keep it on medium flame and keep stirring in between and will and our rest of the ingredients first of all we'd add coriander powder okay I've added to one and a half to 2 tbsp of coriander powder and i'm adding 1 tsp of red chilli powder if you like more heat you can add more mix it properly and cook it for 5 minutes and keep stirring in between okay it has been five minutes since my doll is simmering away now I'll add this masala I have taken half teaspoon of this masala paste and I will put it into water mix properly it will give a nice red color to the doll and a nice flavor this is always properly and add it to the darn now I'll add my butter now I forgot to mention in the ingredients will our darkest we make you also it's nothing but drive friend eat leaves clicking on one tablespoon of pursue anything in your heart crushed between your palms and added mix nicely okay now there are two ways to cook this doll one is we can cook it over a slow flame for 15 20 minute otherwise we put the lid back and cook till two whistles so I will prefer the second method because it was makin faster ok now after to the sills have taken the lid off now you can see the texture of the doll it's a little thin but you don't worry about that it will get the texture gradually now I'll greed a pinch of nutmeg into it don't add much because it has a very strong flavor I'm adding half cup of milk normally they are cream in this but I don't prefer adding green because it makes the dish very rich so if you prefer you can use our 2 tablespoon of cream otherwise i am adding half cup of melt into it add the milk once it's a little cold so that the milk doesn't harden up mix it properly take it back to the gas and simmer it for 2 to 3 minutes again after that let it cool on for 45 minutes and you will have the right texture of the dot ok now you can see the doll has become very rich and creamy now and it's ready to be solved ok now it's ready to be eaten I sounded with fresh cream aren't kasoori methi you can have it with chapati and it goes very well with plain rice ok friends thanks for watching the video if you liked it please do subscribe thank you
