 g'day guys today I'm going to show you how I make onion rings now these are a great snack and they're beautiful and crispy and very easy to make so I'm going to start by making the batter here I've got a 1/2 cup of plain flour 1/4 cup of corn flour now this helps the batter to become nice and light and crispy and my secret ingredient 2 tablespoons of oat flour now this gives the batter some nice body and crunch and complements the corn flour well so add the flour to a bowl then add 1 egg 1/2 cup of water a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of sugar mix together well until you get a nice smooth thick batter leave this to stand for half an hour so that oat flour can hydrate properly and while that's happening cut your onions into 1 centimeter thick slices and then remove the center rings so you just have the larger outer rings remaining so here I've got my onion rings my batter and some panko bread crumbs now you can use regular bread crumbs if you like but the panko will just make them that much crispier so simply take the onion rings place it in the batter make sure all exes batter is run off and then lightly coat in the bread crumbs just repeat this step for all of your onion rings and now it's time to cook I'm shallow frying these in some oil and what I'm doing here is just using a piece of bread to tell when the oils ready so when it sizzles like that it's time to put in those onion rings now these are very quick to cook they only take about 30 seconds per side turning once and when they're done carefully remove them from the oil and place them onto a wire rack so the excess oil can run off and this is what you get guys absolutely beautiful enjoy as you can hear they're beautiful and crispy be sure to give these ago they are delicious thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time
