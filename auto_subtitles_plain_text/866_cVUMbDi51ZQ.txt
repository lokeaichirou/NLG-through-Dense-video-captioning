 hi everybody I'm rockin Robin and today I'm going to show you how to make spring rolls now these are super healthy they make a great appetizer and the reason they're so healthy is because they're made with fresh vegetables and of course you can put anything you want in it so what I'm going to be putting in mine are some baby shrimps carrots cucumbers onions to name a few things and we're going to serve it up with a nice spicy peanut sauce so I'll be right back to show you how to do it are you ready to go for the ingredients small here we go let's start so the first thing I'm going to show you is our dipping sauce which we'll be making that first okay so we need some peanut butter this is sesame seed oil soy sauce some sugar now in here you can't really see anything but there is some rice vinegar in there and we'll need some minced fresh garlic and some sriracha sauce which you can also substitute hot chili sauce if you like so for the rest of our ingredients we are going to be using this is called fine rice vermicelli and it comes in a package I should have had this up here comes in a package like this and you get this in the Asian in an Asian market and basically all you do with it is you take out the pieces I'm gonna show you a piece this one looks like this and it's hard right now and you just soak it in nice hot water for about five to ten minutes and it turns out like this and you just strain out the water so it's nice and soft and that's going to go inside of our spring roll okay so we'll need some carrot I have some cucumber here green onion and like I said I'm going to be putting some shrimp into mine this is already cooked now here's what we're going to be rolling up our spring rolls with this is rice paper and this is pretty interesting stuff let me show you a piece here it feels like plastic and you see that beautiful pattern on there that's when they lay the rice out on bamboo and this is what imprints on the rice so what we're going to do with this is simply soak it in water for just a few minutes just very few and it gets very soft and pliable and then we'll fill our spring rolls in this and roll it up like a burrito now I'm also going to be using a little bit of cilantro and some lettuce now with the lettuce you're going to probably not want to use the real crispy part of the romaine this is romaine here and this part here is pretty crispy and it might make it difficult to roll your spring roll plus it might break the rice paper covering so a buttered lettuce would be really nice anything with a soft leaf and then I'm also going to be using a little bit of basil and that's pretty much it so let's go ahead and start off with the dipping sauce like I mentioned and so we're going to place all those ingredients in my food processor so first in goes the peanut butter the soy sauce the sesame seed oil it has a nice roasted flavor the rice vinegar the garlic the sugar and I don't know if I mentioned earlier I'm going to throw in a little bit of cilantro OOP some of that garlic there and I'm going to give a squirt of sriracha sauce you know just put in as much as you like how much heat you like does it's more of a trial and error kind of thing so we'll blend this up now what I want to do is go in and scrape this down now right now this sauce is a little thick and so I may thin it down a little bit with some water to get the consistency a little thinner so you can see right here that this is really really thick and that doesn't make for a good dipping sauce does it so we're going to add a little water to that and by a little I mean make probably a tablespoon and we're just going to work it in until we get the consistency we want so just keep stirring it around it's getting there I think I'm going to add just a little bit more water and of course if you want it even thinner that's good but I think this is a nice consistency here and this will we'll just set this aside until we're ready to eat our spring rolls now that we have our peanut sauce made now we just need to chop up and get everything prepared so it's ready to go into the spring rolls so let's start off with our onions go ahead and chop off the root end and a little bit of the other end and you just want to dice this up the other option could would be and I find this easier is to you know cut this into strips but I think cutting it and dicing it works well now for the carrots you have a couple of different options you can either peel them or not I didn't peel this one because it's Danika and one option is if you have a peeler like this one it has the ridges right here I'll show you what how it works you see how it just makes little julienne pieces it's really nice they're nice and small I personally don't like a big chunk of carrot so this works well if you don't have this let me do a couple more swipes it's pretty cool how that works you just go around rotate your carrot now if you don't have this I'll show you what you can do with your knife cut off a piece it's you know because this thing rolls around a lot it's nice to cut a wedge so that now your carrot will just sit solid and it's not going to roll around on you and that piece you cut off you can just do some real fine chopping on it and get real nice thin pieces you want your pieces thin I think now let's move on to the cucumber I like to peel mine again this one's organic but I still I still want to peel it so go ahead and peel your your cucumber now here you want them to fit into your rice paper so you might want to cut this into thirds just to be sure and then I'm going to cut it in half and I'm just going to cut very thin pieces if you don't like the seeds you can leave those out it doesn't bother me so I leave them in the other option is to use the peeler like we did with the carrots we'll break it up into small little threads like that if you like that it just depends on how you want it to be and whatever's easier for you now for the lettuce you know I told you I wasn't going to use the the very crunchy part of the leaves so I'm just going to tear off the softer part into pieces I'll just be able to lay that into the spring roll next we have the basil so with the basil I'm just going to tear the leaves into small pieces that way I can just kind of spread this out I don't want a big an entire leaf in one spot I'd like to just kind of put little pieces across it and our last thing is the cilantro so this I'm pretty much just going to leave it just tear off a little bit and place it on your spring roll so we got a bunch there okay so now we're ready to start making spring rolls so what I have here is I have a pie plate filled with some water and it's just lukewarm water and I have one let's see I got one of the rice papers so I'm going to place it into the water and I'm only going to place one at a time we're only going to make one at a time okay and we're going to leave it in here I'm just going to keep my hands in here because I can feel it getting soft now right now it's still you know you can even hear it it's not soft enough yet so I want to show you what that looks like probably takes a you know 20 seconds or so I'm not sure okay I think we're ready lay it down here on the cutting board and spread it out as best you can it's hard to see right now I don't know if you can see it but it's pretty transparent here on the board now the first thing you put down is what's going to be the most noticeable so I want to put down some shrimp first so that that will be seen okay so I'll just put a few across just like that and then I'll probably add all maybe a little bit of carrot sprinkle it across you don't want to make it too big because you get a lot of things to add put some of the cukes down like that and we have the vermicelli plate everything goes directly across it's just like building a burrito here's a little onion and a little bit of basil a little bit of cilantro if you don't like cilantro guys just leave it out you can do parsley you could even do mint mint is really nice too so you can play with this and like I said you can put anything you want in these things now some lettuce I was even thinking about putting some nuts in here I think nuts would be really nice okay so that's that part alright so now I'm going to fold it up so I'm going to pick it pick up the skin here and you want it to be tight so I'm going to tuck it in tight okay and roll it over and once you make a roll over now you can do the edges fold the edges in that keeps them nice and tight fold in the other one and then you can continue to roll it up alright just like that pretty simple right and then I'll just set this over here on my plate so that's all there is to making spring rolls pretty simple and pretty flexible dish and you can add like I said anything you want to put in there I'm going to go ahead and take a little taste I'm getting kind of hungry dip some of that into the sauce what a delicious healthy thing to eat guys I hope you'll try this and I hope this helps you out you know how to fold them and how to do it so if you enjoyed this video please give me a thumbs up and
