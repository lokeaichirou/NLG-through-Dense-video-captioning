 time for a deep fried seafood delight that is surprisingly simple to make let's make some salt and pepper squid on the one part chef let's make some salt and pepper squid first I've got four large squid tubes also known as squid hoods and we're just going to slice along one side to open it up and using a sharp knife we're just going to cut little diagonal lines along the inside surface you don't need to cut all the way through just score those marks all on the inside Pat that dry with a bit of paper towel just to get any excess liquid off and simply slice the squid up into small pieces that's our squid chopped up so we can just set that aside while we work on our coating next I've got a snap lock freezer bag now this makes things so much easier when it comes to crumbing things I'm going to put in a quarter of a cup of plain all-purpose flour two tablespoons of corn flour or cornstarch this helps to add a nice sort of silky texture to this crumb mixture this is salt and pepper squid after all so we're going to put in a little bit of salt and some pepper and just add a little bit of extra flavor I'm adding in about a teaspoon of garlic powder and for a little bit of pepper I'm putting in about half a teaspoon of chili just give that a bit of a shake around just to mix everything up next we're going to add in our squid pieces and we're just going to seal this up and gently toss it around to coat squids lovely encoded so we can set that aside while we heat up our oil I've got about one liter or four cups of cooking oil I'm just using some regular vegetable oil for this and I've got it in my big wok over a high heat and we're just heating up that oil until it gets to about a hundred and ninety degrees or until a piece of bread dropped into the oil turns nice and golden in about ten seconds we're going to gently place about half of our squid pieces into the oil and my lab is to cook for about four minutes or until they curl up and go nice and golden try not to overcook them because otherwise they'll go kind of rubbery humans later and our squid is lovely and golden it's curled up and looking gorgeous so we just take that out with a slotted spoon and transfer it onto a plate lined with some kitchen paper towel to drain off any excess oil and then we'll allow this oil to come back to temperature and cook the rest of our squid and here we have our completed salt and pepper squid which I'm just serving with a little bit of tirta sauce but of course you could serve this with some garlic aioli or just squeeze a lemon wedge over the top absolutely fantastic the smell is amazing I cannot wait to have a taste there is nothing like freshly made seafood especially when it's got this wonderful chrome mix on it so I'm going to have a dip and have a taste hmm yeah hmm it's lovely and perfectly cooked you've got that wonderful mixture on the outside not too spicy lots of flavor there mmm YUM well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show calm and until next time see you later this took no more than about 20 minutes to make it was very simple very very effective and trust me you make this your family and friends will be begging you for it it's so so easy to do so I'm going to have a bit more
