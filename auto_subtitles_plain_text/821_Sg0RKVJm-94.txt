 hi everybody its catalina and today i'm going to make sour crack I really really love sauerkraut this is such a delicious condiment and it's also nutritious as well I really like it because it's very easy to make and it just makes everything taste better you can always buy already made sauerkraut in shops but the problem is I usually pasteurized so you're not getting any good bacteria in there and really that's the whole point on eating sauerkraut so when you make it at home you know what you're using you know ingredients that are in there and you know that the bacteria is gonna be there it's very important that you use organic cabbage really the bodies of sauerkraut is cabbage you can add any other spices or vegetables you want but the base of it is cabbage and you want to make sure it's organic because when it's organic really cabbage comes covered in a lot of bacteria really good bacteria for your gut and all organic vegetables are but when you're using a pesticide a product that has been treated with pesticides by bacteria is not there and they're not so nutritious anyway those vegetables so when you're using when you are fermenting this organic cabbage and you put it in these salted water all that good bacteria is going to multiply and basically the cabbage becomes a lot more nutritious than when you really induce raw cabbage our crab has a lot of health benefits I really like it because it improves digestion and when you have it you don't have my car hold out of it you have a desert condiment and basically is going to help you absorb the nutrients from your food it's also going to give you all the enzymes you need to digest your food is really good for allergies it really strengthens your immune system and I really really like it for skins of you're struggling with any skin problems and sauerkraut is going to be amazing for it and like I'm saying so easy to make so I'm just going to show you now what you need to make it first of all you will need some cabbage I like using both green and purple cabbage I really want large one is enough to make about 2 liters of sauerkraut I will also add some fresh carrots a big piece of fresh ginger but you can add any spices or herbs that you like I also add some fresh garlic cloves green chillies and lastly you will need about 1 or 2 tablespoons of salt for you Brian the first thing I'm going to do is remove about two or three of those outer leaves of these cabbages this cabbages are very big so those leaves are already old I'm ready tough and they have some holes in them so I'm going to be discarding loose and then with these leaves that I'm left I'm going to take about three or four and I'm going to wash them in some filtered water and I'm going to set them aside I'm going to be using those at the end I don't really wash the whole cabbage but if your cabbage is dirty and you want to wash it make sure you're using filtered water that's very very important and now I'm going to start the slicing the cabbage the first thing I do is remove the core and then I end up with about the four big pieces and then I'm going to start slicing it very very thinly once I'm done with the cabbage I'm going to place it into a clean stainless steel pot I'm going to sprinkle some of the salt on top of it and I'm going to leave it covered while I process the rest of the vegetables I'm also going to grate the carrots and I went to chop the chilies very very small I want to be using their seeds because then it's too spicy I'm also going to be grating the garlic and the chili and I'll be adding them on top of the cabbage I'm going to give that a little a good mix and I'm going to add the rest of the salt now using this wood pounder I'm going to start mashing all of the vegetables and I'm going to do this for at least five minutes this is going to release all of the juices from the vegetables and that's what you want because then you have to add less water and you can see how the look of the vegetables change they start very crunchy very crispy and then after I've done this for a while they become a lot softer and there is a lot of juice at the bottom and now I'm going to start packing the sauerkraut into a clean mason jar and the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to add a little bit of that into the jar and then I'm going to press it down really hard and then add a little bit more and then do that with the pounded again and what you want to do is remove as much air as possible and pack it very very tight and then you can see how it looks from the side there is a lot of juice in there and I didn't really add any water to this this was all the juice that was released from the vegetables however if you find that you didn't get a lot of juice you can always add some filtered water and now with the clean leaves I had set aside I'm going to start following them and putting them on top of the vegetables the purpose of this is to use the muscle weight that is going to keep all of the other vegetables submerged under water that prevents any fungal growth in your vegetables and then I'm going to place the lid of the mason jar very loosely and I'm going to let the vegetables sit undisturbed for any time between a week and a month well and I hope you enjoy this recipe I would love to know you have had any experience with sauerkraut so please let me know in the
