 vegetable spring roll hi I'm an open and welcome you to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana let's make a popular Chinese starter vegetable spring roll very easy let's quickly run through the ingredients for this I need about 8 spring roll wrappers they're very easily available in most of the leading supermarkets they're available frozen so you just have to buy a packet and use as in how you need them about 1/4 shredded cabbage 2 medium carrots cut into fine strips 1 green capsicum cut into fine strips 1/2 a cup of bean sprouts about 2 tablespoons of refined flour 1 TSP of soya sauce 2 stalks of spring onion greens finely chopped 2 bulbs of spring onion finely sliced 1 TSP white pepper powder oil to deep fry salt to taste okay so I have a wok here Chinese food is essentially made in a wok because the cooking has to be very fast and it becomes easier to toss all the vegetables also I have a karai with oil here which I have kept to heat so once we're done with the mixture we'll roll quickly and fry the spring rolls so the oil here in this wok is well heated now we add spring onions to this we'll add some capsicum we'll add some carrots add some cabbage now all these vegetables have a lot of moisture so when you toss them in a pan they automatically reduces in size it shrinks so you may have to take a lot of vegetables but you may end up having very little mixture so this too which will also add some bean sprouts bean sprout are not a very important ingredient in Chinese cooking apart from spring roll is used in soups fried rice a lot of other saucy preparations also used bean sprouts so after this we'll add some salt some pepper powder a little bit of soya sauce now we have to just toss this that's it it's gone we'll add some spring onion greens to this switch off the gas and what we have to do here is we have to cool this mixture before we put it into the spring roll wrappers so that's it with the filling now another important thing that we have to do is I have refined flour with me what happens is when you make any non-veg spring roll it becomes very easy to stick the wrappers with egg but since we are doing a vegetarian spring roll how do you stick it so we'll add some water to this okay so now let's begin with these wrappers I have spring roll wrappers with me which I have mentioned to you that they are frozen take one wrapper we'll put the filling in the center this mixture that we have done we will just put it like this just roll this fold it like this okay it's very important to put this slurry here at the end and now roll this so before you put this in oil just see to it that it's well sealed from the sides as well as here because if this is not sealed well when you put this entire roll in the oil it will all come out and you will not have a spring roll anymore so one will slide into the oil similarly we'll slide the others also now we have to fry them till it is nice and golden oil has to be absolutely hot so just turn and give it nice golden color so now this is done drain them off onto a plate and we leave this onto this paper for a while till all the excess oil is absorbed if needed you can also put some on top and just let the oil get absorbed well so before you serve take one spring roll and cut into half here you go vegetable spring rolls are ready make this recipe just the way I have made it and you'll love it you
