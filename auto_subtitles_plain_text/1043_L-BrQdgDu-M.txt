 welcome to another video recipe demonstration of Coco's Mediterranean cuisine thank you for joining me today I am Coco and today we will be preparing the toosh salad the douche is a Lebanese salad made with fresh ingredients fresh vegetables and it is seasoned with a spice that adds to the Tanguts of this lovely salad it is made with romaine lettuce tomatoes radishes parsley leaves mint leaves cucumbers green onions and toasted pita bread made with tossed in a vinaigrette addressing garlic lemon juice and olive oil and seasoned with swamp which is a spice that glows in the Middle East region that can be found in your local grocery store or at the international food stores near you I today I had purchased everything that we have here for a local farm and this recipe is makes a great great compliment to a poultry steak or fish you could have it as a meal by itself by adding a chicken breast or salmon off the grill or even stay to it or if you prefer it's simply as ash Italian dish you could go Ã®sh it with a little bit of feta cheese I prepared everything here it's all ready to incorporate together the romaine lettuce is torn and bite-sized pieces we will add one tomato here that is diced radishes this is three or four radishes these are three green onions that are diced 1 cucumber peeled and dust as well I prefer to keep the mint leaves whole but you may use kitchen scissors and snip them they tend to add a little bit of food style to it when it's plated and the perf that leaf parsley as well you may prefer to cut it with scissors make it look prettier once we have all the ingredients here in a bowl we will add the vinegar and the traditional recipe calls for the grant to be fried but you can also tilt it in the oven with a brushing of olive oil and some salt to annual more taste to it you can add as much as one loaf that's toast at the two loads depending on your taste to juice your hands to incorporate all the video games together and then here we have the two tablespoons of sunnah that already pre-measured you can add that to the fattoush this is an excellent one for tasting spice not only does it add a citrus flavor to it but it is beautiful pleasing to the eye as well okay this is one of my favorite salads it is very satisfying it is refreshing and I prefer to have it as a meal on its own without any vegetables or other vegetables or wrong meats thank you for joining me and for the recipe you may visit me at my website at www was in displaying reasonable you
