 showcasing everyday Indian cooking I'm today going to make chicken curry very simple just cutting chicken in small pieces and we'll cook it in yogurt base in yogurt curry so let's go ahead and get started I'm using 350 grams of boneless chicken cut into small pieces I also have here two small potatoes cut in small chunks and ginger garlic green chili onion some basic Indian spices half a cup of yogurt and tomato paste now what I'm going to do is here in my wok I have two tablespoons of oil heating up and as soon as it's hot enough we'll go ahead and add one teaspoon of cumin seeds looks like while his hot mouth we'll go ahead and add a 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds look at that they're spluttering right away so we'll go ahead and add onions ginger garlic and green chillies so I'm using 1 large chopped onion 3 4 cloves of garlic chopped 1 inch piece of ginger and 1 small green chilli so we'll try them out until onion tone golden brown and ginger garlic uses the raw flavor let's make our yogurt gravy base so in my 1/2 cup of yogurt here you can see it's nice and thick we'll go ahead and add 1/2 a cup of water and along with water we'll add some spices so for spices half a teaspoon of red chili powder half a teaspoon of turmeric that's healthy salt as per taste I'm adding 2 teaspoons and half a teaspoon of coriander powder adding coriander powder in so we'll mix everything well together blend it with the yogurt so that it's a nice smooth liquid base right so our nice yogurt gravy base is ready curry base is ready if my onions have started to change color they are not completely golden brown that they have started to change color so now I'll go ahead and add my chicken pieces in and give it two minutes until chicken is completely sealed besides our white and we do that so that when we cook chicken it doesn't dry out it remains moist and juicy and then we add potatoes actually rose because it helps in two ways number one he starch in potatoes prevents yogurt from curdling up secondly it lends a great flavor to the dish and we are using small pieces of chicken because it cooks faster but you can also use like chicken drumsticks or other cups chicken is white from the outside so we'll go ahead and add our tomatoes give them two minutes potatoes have been flying for two minutes now we'll go ahead and add tomato paste 1/2 a tablespoon silicon now we are not adding too much of the middle face because tomatoes are tangling yoga bassist Andy you don't want to travel chicken Kelly you still want to have a nice flavor to that pie only profitable thing here all right you can also use fresh tomatoes if you want tomatoes are in now we'll go ahead and add our yogurt base our curry base and then cover it and let our chicken cook for 5-6 minutes and then it's completely done forgot sorry base stir it in so that everything is nicely blended together and cover it and let it cook and keep stirring it in between so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan our chicken has been simmering for 5-6 minutes let's check and see the curry looks ready check the chicken if it's completely done from inside it's good you can go ahead and eat it yep completely wired it's done check the potatoes they should be tender and if they break easily they are done in just the last finishing touch and add half a teaspoon of garam masala gives a very nice flavor aroma to the dish and pinch of fenugreek leaves so I'm just going to sprinkle dried fenugreek leaves called kasoori methi and just before serving add freshly chopped cilantro leaves go ahead enjoy this meal with roti naan rice and don't forget to subscribe and comment on ET Sinden channel looking forward to see your comments citing delicious tempting chicken curry for you
