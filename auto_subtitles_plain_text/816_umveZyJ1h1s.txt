 hello folks today we are sharing our recipe for sour kraut sauerkraut is an essential condiment in German cuisine it's something that we prepare quite often here at the RAF and house sauerkraut is composed of two things salt and cabbage and they are pickled and fermented and for about a week at a time in large batches and it's a great way to preserve cabbage and to have a nice condiment to use for hot dogs or hamburgers or whatever you like and here's how we make it I have two cabbages I've got a red one and a green one I've also got carrots onion garlic and our flavoring agents which are red chili flakes a little bit of dried dill and two tablespoons of sea salt I'm using one tablespoon per cabbage that's basically how it works out and it's quite simple all we do is we take these ingredients we chop them up toss them together and we put them in a big crock and we weigh them down until we get a nice brine and it ferments for about a week and after that you're blessed with a brilliant brilliantly colored sauerkraut and it keeps quite well so let's get started okay I like to prepare my salt first two tablespoons of sea salt as I said before kosher salt is another good choice for this kosher salt has unique abilities to dry out moisture from vegetables or meats and that could be used also so I'm going to add some of my chili flakes and then I'll add a little bit of my dried dill and remember the herbs and spices that you use for this are up to you I take this and I just crunch it all up together and if you like sauerkraut you might want to try kimchi recipes as well because there are kimchi recipes that call for all kinds of ingredients really exotic stuff the sky's the limit as far as that goes but for sauerkraut we want to keep our recipe fairly simple we don't deviate too much from the from the two basic ingredients which are salt and cabbage okay so I've got that mixed up set that aside now if we use two heads of green cabbage will end up with green sauerkraut two heads of the red cabbage will have a nice deep purple sauerkraut but you can find that you combine the two together and you get something that's just lightly pink and it's really quite gorgeous and so as far as chopping this up it's really quite simple we're going to chop into big chunks discarding the core and we're going to process these in the food processor so we have that coarsely chopped going to transfer these to a handy-dandy food processor and that's what we're looking for and all of our ingredients are going to go into this big bowl we're going to mix them in the bowl before we transfer them to our big crock to ferment so again coarsely chopped into the food processor not too much we don't want to overcrowd it doesn't that look nice okay so cabbage is all chopped it's in our big bowl we move on to the carrots gorgeous gorgeous organic carrots so that's what we're looking for and we will add our diced onion not a lot and our diced garlic again maybe a clove onion and garlic are rather powerful ingredients so we only use just a little bit just to add that little underlying flavor which I like and toss it all together so the salt is going to draw some of that moisture out of the cabbage the cabbage does have a lot of moisture so does the onion carrots do as well so the salt will draw out that moisture and as it sits in that croc will put a little bit of weight on it and a brine will start to form and we want that brine to rise above the vegetables here and when it sits there's just enough salt that it will prevent any nasty bacteria from growing but not so much that it'll prevent lactic acid from being produced and so the the wild airborne bacteria and yeasts will start to work away at the at the cabbage nettle ferment for about a week and after that you've got gold sauerkraut and other pickled things are often fermented in a crock like this a ceramic crock and these are nice I like these but what I actually prefer is this clear pyrex dish cool thing about the Pyrex is that as this thing is sitting you can check on it every day all you have to do is look right through that clear pyrex and you can see how your crowd is doing so it's a nice way to check up on your on your pickles now with our handy potato masher we mash this down and by doing this we're also helping to release some of the moisture from these gorgeous vegetables you'll notice as you press down see some of that liquid coming up that's when you know you've done a good job here and what you want to do is you want to find a plate that's just just barely going to fit inside your container okay I'll put that down press in you see that you see that Brian coming up if it's exactly what we're looking for gotta press kind of hard on that and to keep this way down a mason jar seems to do the trick filled with water and to keep bugs from getting in I like to use a pillow case to cover this with put that pillowcase over just like so and in winter months we like to leave this at room temperature because it's a little bit cool in winter months we'll leave this at room temperature for only the eight or nine days and that usually is enough time for this thing to to ferment properly and into Pickle as it should in summer months when it's warmer if you leave it out at room temperature it might be done in five or six days but we'll probably leave this for about eight maybe nine days and check on it periodically like this this is again why I like using the clear dish and the pillowcase I can just kind of peek underneath it and just see how everything's going so when when those eight days are up we'll check on it it should be finished there might be a little bit of mold on the top but we can just scrape that off and we can store them in large glass containers like this they will stay in the fridge for about a year typically you'll eat it before then but this is a great way to preserve vegetables they really do last a long time when your sauerkraut is finished the possibilities again are endless you can put the sauerkraut on just about anything hot dogs are nice anything anything barbecue hot dogs hamburgers steak it's all fair game what we like to do is take a loaf of whole grain sourdough take your bread which we may toast we may not take a little bit of mayonnaise or maybe a little bit more mayonnaise and on top of the mayonnaise we add our finished sauerkraut and this my friends is a delicious delicious little snack this is how we do it at the RAF in the house we hope you try and we hope you like it
