 hi guys it's mommy tang I just came back from Whole Foods as you see and I got some so to my mandarins oh my gosh they're so good I can't wait to start eating them again I'm also here now my Korean grocery shop supermarket and money buy some udon frozen noodles because my daughter came home from school really sick too cold and I gave it to me and my little one so now we're feeling that awful so during the day we're eating lots of fruits and veggies and Jews and all that stuff but at night we want to eat something soupy and hot so I want to make food on now a lot of the food all dishes out there there are made with anchovy broth that's that little little tiny tiny fish but this is totally vegan and chemical free and it's fast because I am using just instant noodles they are just made out of a flour tapioca flour and salt and water I believe and you know you could make your own really but I all something fast when I go home just want to make the broth and just put the noodle in there and to serve it to my kids and so I could eat just rest and also towards the end of the video I will be sharing with you what to buy what kind of noodle I like and when you're here ever in clear markets what to look for the reason I'm not looking at the camera and looking around is because there's like so many people just walking by me and they're looking at me like I'm crazy like I'm talking to somebody like by myself I'm not crazy I'm just talking to you guys but they don't know that so my eyes are wandering off yeah they think I'm crazy crazy well I hope you liked the recipe see you guys oil six cups of water for of hand-sized kombu Fistful of dry scallion roots two dried shiitake mushrooms two whole scallions two sliced daikons ground one inch thick one teaspoon of pepper corn one whole onions sliced in half three cloves of garlic now bring it to boil with lid on once it starts to boil bring down to simmer for 20 to 30 minutes add in your sweetener am using 1/3 cup of coconut sugar 3 tbsp of low-sodium soy sauce you could always adjust the amount take out all the ingredients with strainer saving only the mushrooms the broth is now ready prepare your garnish I'm using zucchini shiitake mushroom that was saved from the stock broccoli some green peppers then Lee sliced carrots and minced scallions know that you could use pretty much any veggies of your choice for topping next take frozen noodles out of their packages make sure to keep them frozen bring broth to boil add in the frozen noodles stir to break them apart they are done when you see steam arise from the pot make sure not to overcook them transfer the noodles into a big bowl add in the broth you could eat them like so however let's dress them up a bit by adding our garnish cuz we do eat with our eyes first finally sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds some black peppers Japanese spices you could skip this however it does make things little spicy and yummy are also the ingredients are natural some shredded seaweed papers and it is done this is my local Korean Asian supermarket let's go find some noodles first we have the dried noodles they don't usually come with the soup base next we have the refrigerated noodles however most of them come with soup base as you could see the soup base ingredients of MSG and other chemicals and this is main reason why I make my own broth now we have the frozen ones this is the one that I get because most of them come without the soup base however make sure to check the back for ingredients some do come with soup base I hope you enjoy your Bhutan
