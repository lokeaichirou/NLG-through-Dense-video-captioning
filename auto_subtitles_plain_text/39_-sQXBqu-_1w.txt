 now the chances are you're watching this video she's looking for quick speedy dinner but you lack the very basic kitchen skills so today I'm going to show you all the tips and tricks to awesome knife skills that means you can chop without losing fingers and we're going to create an incredible pork stir-fried rice dish because let's face it a chimpanzee with an axe has better knife skills in you now I reckon have a stirfry at home at least once a week it's really easy so together yeah and the only skill is getting everything ready ahead of cooking chopped up nice and fine and last we're gonna look at today knife skills yeah okay so first up the pork we need to marinate this is tenderloin and pork loin and all I want you to do is cut it into small strips the key here is a board isn't going to move around yep a knife that's nice and sharp and then just let the knife do the work as you slide through if you've got a nice sharp knife it will do and I see you're using the claw technique with the hand yes so thumb behind the fingers and then all you're doing is your knife is sliding down that nail okay and there's no way you can cut your finger and meanwhile over on this side I'm going to make a marinade for that pork which is root ginger a couple of cloves garlic blend it up with some liquid so in the marinade what I'm going to do is little spice grinder I'm just going to put soy yes that's the salty flavor going in a shot of mirin which is a sweet rice wine yep and that is incredible and now we've got kind of the fiery peak of the ginger and the raw garlic going in as well that's it simple as that pop the lid on blend up and we're going to marinate our pork in that now you can do that just for a few moments before you fry it why you cut a formative edge or you can do it in the morning leave it all day and be amazing my time your homes dinner typically this machine with beef for grinding spices or coffee beans or nuts but I find for pastes and marinades is brilliant to give us a way that now even taste it oh it's pretty strong because you've got the fiery heat of ginger this is skip garlic that's going to go in there all to go for kin and then just leave that to marinate for a little while while we cut up all of the veg and the key to a good stir fry it to make sure everything is about the same size well get rid of the raw meat board you can your hands first up red onion do we want a dice of red onion cut into where the root was like that but sort of 3/4 of the way through remember the claw you keep your fingers back and then turn it and go the other way what your left is here is a dice of a layers top advice on pepper so you minimize the waste cut the bottom off then the top off then down one side and then carve will way around it means all the seeds come out in one and then you can slice everything else into small matchstick like pieces don't let knife leave the board you're rocking back and forth and you end up with awesome Julian where's our pepper onion done next up sugar snap peas you could use more - at the moment they're a little bit too big so the same thing use that rocking action keep the knife on the board - just cut it into strips like that and that way the strip's will be on par with the pepper and I'm going to take tender stem broccoli now this is already small florets of broccoli I'm just going to cut them in half because the stalks the biggest bit and you can just cut down the stalk and just kind of tear it and it will find its natural line you end up with pieces like that now the last thing we have to get ready before we start to cook is our rice we already have it ready because it's leftover if you're going to cook it fresh cook yourself off some rice until it's just cooked then drain it lay out a tray and let it cool down and that allows it from steam dry as well if you want quite dry cold rice cool okay then we need a walk and the walk has to be to the max and this bit this is that you love yeah coconut oil and that's what we going to fry and so you guys suggested it basically a couple of reasons one it has a higher smoke point but also just if you get a good quality oil you get the coconut flavor coming through it as well so with the ginger and the mirin and the coconut and all these veg absolutely delicious killer combination don't put it in until your wok is already hot then when that is nice and hot but first I'm gonna do is cook our meat smells like a body shop so hot it smell like suntan lotion isn't it and then in with it and it has to be that hot you get the nice crisp labor you're doing this bit so stir-fry you kind of want to keep it moving smells unreal and how long do I do this for before it's it's I take it out to do this hot enough that's almost cooked because we cut the pork so fine let the soy and the ginger stuff will caramelizing at this point want to scoot the pork out but leave the oil in the wok that's now got all the amazing porky flavors of the ginger in the mirin next up your onions go in and this is so easy so quick provide you've got everything just to the side you get all your prep done when you're being trained it's called meson class see another top tip is if you say anything that you're doing in the kitchen in French makes it sound more skillful so I tend to spend broccoli and our Rouge peppers the other great thing about stir-fry is we're not going to overcook this now it's really not like currently you want the crunch of edge here and then in goes the rice now the rice is cold so we need to give this time to heat all the way through you're doing it perfectly but basically straight right down to the bottom those bottom bits that will get caught but with a silicon spatula or wooden spatula get under there works free and just measure this a stick other spectrums are available when you're happy that rice is hot all the way through back in with our pork and all those juices that come out of the pork and then the sauce itself so simple a squeeze of sweet chili sauce bit of a cheek but I do lately love it I love sweet chili and loving it with soy there is a little bit the marinade but instead of putting in salt put in a little bit of soy sauce keep it moving make sure it's piping hot and that's it like less than five minutes to the stir-fry once you've got all the bits ready and there we go a super-speedy stir-fry when you're a beginner or not you can absolutely nail this every time is I stir fried rice with pork sausage it's a speedy evening dish isn't it mm-hmm they only give a lesson into how to use those or is that completely separate video use a fork if you're not comfortable it that coconut oil just makes this it just takes it to a different level entirely yes there's nothing else to say other than if you know someone out there like me who would benefit from watching this video and please share it with them and do the planets in service you
