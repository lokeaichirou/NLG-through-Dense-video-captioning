 hey guys I'm Scott and thanks so much for watching in a previous video I showed you guys how to make homemade bratwurst and this recipe I'm going to show you a quick and easy way to cook them as bratwurst of course you could have bought these in the supermarket but why not make them fresh if I can do it you can do it for sure I have one pound of homemade bratwurst here and I have a dish here that's going to be able to go into the oven we're going to do this in a roasted version so I'm going to turn on the heat I'm going to add my bratwurst today's recipe is available at portland comfort food comm just click on the chefs blog and you'll find all of my video recipes right there so I have my 1 pound of sausages in the roasting pan I'm going to pour in two beers just recovered and then about a teaspoon of salt sea salt of course and to this I have one small and yellow onion I'm just going to put that right in on top I'm going to mixture come up to a boil and let these sausages boil for about five minutes but make sure the beer in the onions is just coming up to a boil just get grab a pair of tongs you want to keep rotating these sausages just to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of your pan and let these boil like I said about five minutes all right it's been about five minutes our sausages are cooked essentially at this point and that's important especially if you're going to be putting these on the grill because if you would put raw sausage just on a grill they would scorch and burn on the outside before the inside is completely done if you're in question grandpa meat their internal thermometer and test for 165 degrees on all of this ground sausage product today I'm going to be showing you a great roasted recipe it's easy for folks who don't have a grill I live in an apartment we're just want to do it inside on a cold and rainy day in a large bowl here I have 10 cloves of really large garlic right inside that have one large red onion sliced break that up a little bit I'm gonna throw them in about a teaspoon of salt and grab some time we probably want 10 sprigs of thyme just thrown in there just like so I have four potatoes I cut into about half-inch pieces they're gonna roast quickly and now I need to add about a teaspoon of pepper to this I get a lot of questions about the photo spice grinder check the points to know it's a Pujo spice grinder but they're really handy okay probably two to three tablespoons of olive oil now that we're going to throw in our sausages this is just going to get me room to get everything well coated with the oil and salt and pepper a little stringer here grab all these onions out then I'm just going to discourage the beer get everything in your bowl toss it well in the olive oil salt and pepper and all that good stuff except all together I'm going back to the same cast-iron dish that I was boiling the sausages then this could be even a sheet pan a roasting pan a casserole dish whatever you have just thought about it my oven is preheated to 375 degrees if you have a roast function on your oven you'll want to do that it just turns on the top double mint occasionally and toss all this right into your big dish and as you can see this rescue would multiply up really really easily and it can be altered if you don't like the onions then cut down the amount of data or garlic or whatever that is so all into our Bowl we're going to put this in the oven approximately an hour I'm going to go in every 20 minutes 30 minutes and just turn everything over so we get a nice caramel color all over the top so there we go our roasted bratwurst right out of the oven with delicious caramelized onions and garlic all mixed in there as well as these potatoes in the star chip that really soaks up so much of this great flavor what I'm doing is just going in and pulling off these little twigs that have the thyme leaves on it he said they all felt fell off and flavored our or dish just kind of Cooper in there get all that out and then call folks to the table because this is ready to serve of course you could put this out on a large platter and bring it to the table or have folks come right to the kitchen and pull it right out of the roasting pan it's so delicious and really nice and easy for even for weeknight dinners you know an hour in the oven turning every 20 minutes it's super simple and a good way to get dinner on the table in a quick way thanks so much for watching again check my website Portland comfort food com click on chefs blog and it'll take you right to my video demonstration recipes and also check out the website we do cooking classes catering you can order food right online it's it's really fun of them getting lots of great response and thanks to everyone here in Portland who has really really supported us here our first month of being open it's really great and I really appreciate it guys have such a great day I'll talk I'll see you soon bye
