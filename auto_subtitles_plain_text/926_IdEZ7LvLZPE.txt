 welcome to Benjamin TV today I'm going to teach you how to do scrambled eggs yes the humble very simple and easy and quick scrambled eggs and we're gonna go right into the ingredients first thing is you're gonna need eggs now I suggest you get farm-fresh or organic if you can I like to have these at room temperature because eggs really cook better when they're a little warmer next you're gonna have butter salt and pepper if you want that's all the ingredients you're actually going to need to use optionally if you want to really spruce it up I have some herbs here this is a mix of tarragon chives and parsley I just freeze these and I use them whenever I want as well as some milk basically aside from that are the tools really important to have something to mix your eggs with chopsticks these are really the best tool when making eggs especially scrambled eggs I will be using a spatula make sure you have a thick bottom pan you want to cook scrambled eggs on a low heat but make sure you have it nice and heated because the residual heat in there is gonna be important for cooking your scrambled eggs properly first things first we're gonna go ahead and crack the eggs and [Music] okay notice I did not put any salt or pepper into the egg mixture I feel like that's something you should put after you cook because actually can affect the way that eggs cook I'm going to take about a tablespoon of butter and put it into this thoroughly warmed pan remember you don't want it too hot this is actually on a low heat key here is to make sure you let it melt but not burn okay now I'm gonna pour in the eggs make sure you mix a little bit so you get those are really important let it sit for about 20 or 30 seconds let it cook through and all you're gonna do is gently slide the spatula through the egg mixture just let it sit for about ten to fifteen more seconds again side to side at this point you're actually really close to being finished so I actually start flipping the eggs on top of each other alright at this point I've turned the heat off and the eggs they look like they're little undercooked but they're fine they're gonna actually cook through with the residual heat that's in the pan after about few moments you're going to go ahead and transfer that onto your plate even though it looks a little undercooked don't worry you're not gonna die you're gonna be fine in fact it's gonna actually create better flavor make sure you salt and pepper time to taste these [Music] I may be biased but that's perfect if I might say anyways that with scrambled eggs quick and easy remember cooking's not as hard as it looks it's actually pretty easy this Benjamin TV thank you for watching if you want more recipes make sure you subscribe the bench man TV and comment below on other recipes you want to see thanks for watching I'll talk to you later today's topic is best protein choices uh what proteins that we II and why we think it's good for you one little thing I will say is look what I'm wearing copy Monday shirt
