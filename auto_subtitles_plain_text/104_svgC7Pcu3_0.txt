 now the first thing you need is a piece of sushi grade fatty tuna and when you go to the meat market be sure to ask for sushi grade seafood that's really important if you don't get that you can really risk making yourself or someone else sick so be sure to double-check with the butcher behind the counter if it is seriously great now our lovely model here is slicing it nice and thin right from the start using our sashimi Hojo and sashimi means basically raw fish and Hojo is the Japanese word for knife that really does make all the difference in the world having a nice sharp knife to work with especially when you're working with excellent cuts of fish like we have today so we sliced horizontally or untie vertically and now we're going back over and trying to get really really small tiny pieces we're going for not quite ground hamburger consistency here because as you know for those of you fans out there from spicy tuna rolls like myself you know we get the really small pieces of fish mixed up with the spicy tuna sauce so that's what we're doing right now is is getting our sashimi grade or sushi grade piece of fish to those little chunks to mix in with a spicy tuna sauce now the Japanese technique here is called tataki and that's what you're witnessing right now I guess chopped is a pretty close translation in English for that it certainly is a little bit different technique but very similar nonetheless and for those of you really interested in Japanese culture and things like that you'll notice that on the Hojo are knife if you will there's some engravings on the side and this knife is from Seki and that's where they originally made all of the ninja swords and right now that's a major hub for Japanese cutley as well me and my family visited there that's where they make some very fine surgical knives as well and actually feather brand who makes shaving things for men his base there as well some excellent knives anything with a blade that comes out of that city is just ridiculously sharp and that's the knife that we're using today as well and I can't stress enough they're having a nice sharp knife working with these kinds of meats really makes all the difference in the world and picture's worth a thousand words so my has been demonstrating the tataki method here certainly be careful with your fingers you don't want to cut yourself and just going back and forth over the meat like so to get it to the almost hamburger consistency is what we're aiming for and I think we're getting pretty close you know just going back and forth back and forth over the meat is really what you need to do so there we are really bunching it together and there we go probably one more pass possibly to to get us there and there we go so you see took a couple minutes but that's the consistent we want now that we know that were at that point one mix in our spicy tuna sauce if you don't know how to make this sauce please see our video we explain exactly how to mix it together for you guys out there now it gets a little trick you'll notice my is kind of slicing the meat with a spoon to mix in the spicy tuna sauce when you get the meat in this consistency it's not exactly the easiest to mix and sauces with but you just kind of rub it together and mix it around it it does take a couple minutes but definitely you want to be gentle with your meat at this point even though we've just chopped it up really really small pieces but you know you don't want to mash it any more than that so just be gentle with it mix it around it might take a couple minutes but you can certainly get it to where you want it to be and there's no hard and fast rules on your ratios here it's whatever flavor you want that's how much of the spicy tuna sauce you mix in whatever you think meets your spiciness taste now we also have the avocado slices that we're going to include well so here we have an avocado that we've already sliced in half here you can just see with the sharp knife going through the avocado like butter it really is a pleasure to cut with those sharp knives so we were making consistent thin slices from the avocado if you want to slice horizontally instead of vertically that's fine too it really is just personal preference at that point and after we slice our avocado we want to be sure to add a little bit of lemon on top we don't want our avocado turning brown in the middle of our sushi roll even though it tastes fine it really does get to be rather unappetizing now we're going to put it on our Maki sushi base if you don't know how to make the base here with the rice in the seaweed please see our Maki sushi video we explain how to do that in depth and really walk you through that process so what we're doing is we're adding the spicy tuna mixture it's hard to tell from the camera angle but it is slightly closer to the chef or a model if you will and you want to extend it all the way to the edges that's really important you don't want to have the orphaned sushi pieces on the end that don't have any fish in them so definitely extend it a little bit past the nori or seaweed if you will and that's really really important so after we do that we want to get our avocado slices and they do have the habit of sticking together on the plate what we found after making the videos that really helps is to add some lemon juice between the slices and also on the plate below that helps them slide right off the plate so you will see how my is adding the avocado slices they're slightly at an angle you don't need to go perfectly horizontal and that's where you want it that's what you want to look like before we go ahead and roll the pieces together now you grab the bamboo mat lift it over enough for it to touch the other side of the sushi and with a firm gripping motion that's how we really get the sushi to come together now you don't want to smash it together you do want to be firm but I definitely don't want to just mash all the gradients in the middle together it really is a fine line that comes over time a little bit of practice and I'm sure you can get it down so we flipped it over again with the firm gripping motion once again and the saran wrap sometimes sticks together but it's not a problem at all and there we go the last round squeeze it a little bit more you'll see some of the spicy tuna coming out the sides if you squeeze it so hard that all of it pops out you definitely know you're gripping too hard but if it does come out just a little bit like so that's perfectly normal and that's what you want it to look like right there so the next step is to add a little bit of the sesame seeds on the side roasted sesame seeds that is and you'll notice we put it on top enough to coat lightly and Pat it in just a touch now next we put on a cutting board and this is really where the sharp knife pays off incredible dividends notice Sarah it's slicing right through and for those of you who do watch some of our videos I want to point out here that we use the rice cooker for the rice that we used on the spicy roll tuna here and you'll notice that it doesn't clump up as bad when you cut through it you'll notice that you get nice clean slices the flavor of the stove type rice comes out the same but with the rice cooker you can see that's where you really get these neat cuts that you can really tell when you're cutting your sushi rolls in particular so here we are you know how thick you want your rolls and things like that is really just up to personal preference it's whatever you like I think we're cutting them a little bit thinner here but that's because we have a family and well like to have a lot of pieces of a lot of different flavored sushi so when you cut it that's what it will look like and the next step is to put it on the plate for display we use the sushi Gaeta if you want to put on regular plate from your kitchen that's perfectly fine usually it's served with the soap wasabi and ginger as we have as well but you take out the pieces for display and there you go there's your spicy tuna roll and we hope they turn out as wonderful in your kitchen as they did arms these tasted fabulous so thanks for watching we appreciate likes and comments and please remember
