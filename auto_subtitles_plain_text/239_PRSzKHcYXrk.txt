 all right any chef buck here and today we're going to bake up some falafel what's a falafel falafel is just chickpea you it's just garbanzo beans it's a fried fritter a garbanzo bean but we're not making a fritter because we're not frying and we're baking them because it's healthier but that's not really why we're doing it we're doing it because easier you know it's less of a pain that's why I'm using the can because it's less of a pain I'm going to drain it and I'm gonna rinse it one can of garbanzo beans and then most everything is going to go in a food processor my hands are not freakishly large it's just the angle of the camera I'm putting the half of the beans in there and then I'm going to go ahead and throw some onion and three cloves of garlic but you know just put two if you're not a garlic lover like I am because that's very garlicky if you put three and then I'm going to put in my spices some coriander some cumin some cayenne pepper a little baking powder some salt the cayenne pepper is optional you know if you're not interested in the heat you know don't use it but if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen as they say some cilantro and parsley fresh quarter cup each but you don't have to use both of them if you just want to use a half a cup of cilantro or half a cup of parsley that's going to be fun too a little bit of olive oil and then I'm going to top it with the rest of the beans from the can you know this is still just the same can I just like to put them on top so my spices and stuff don't stick to the top of the processor because oh I got this little rinky-dink one that I make hummus in and I'm not going to process it for very long you know just a quick little grind grind they beat the Machine and say bad machine so the machine knows it's been bad and then I'm going to look at it see I'm looking at right now that's not enough so I'm going to push it down and I'm going to pulse it you know one more time just for a second because you don't want to over process this stuff you know you're not going to puree it you're not going to liquefy it you know you wanted to have a lot of texture and you know the beans are soft already because they come out of a can you know they're going to stick together just fine plus we're going to throw a little breadcrumb in there anyway just a itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny bit so go ahead and get your mixture process throw it in a bowl and then we'll go ahead and put a tablespoon of bread crumbs or flour and then you know we're ready what we're almost ready to put on the sheet we're going to put in some lemon juice too you know what you don't have to do sometimes I put in sometimes I don't it's not going to be the end of the world either which way in this case though it kind of I think liquefied it a little bit more so that it wasn't as dry so you know just kind of gauge that and whether or not you got a lemon now I'm going to use a tablespoon and I'm going to mount it on there each one of these is going to be about two tablespoons because it's a heaping tablespoon that I'm using to measure this I'm going to get 10 out of this kin which I usually get you know if you want you can just double up the size and make five but I make the I like to make a little rinky-dink ones that will go on a piece of pita bread for a falafel sandwich you know so they're yharnam slide it in the fridge you know letting it sit for a little while because they'll bake up better they won't fall apart they're not gonna fall apart anyway so you don't have to do that part before you're ready to cook them go ahead and drizzle a brush some olive oil on there you know I don't have a brush because we just moved into this place and my brushes in Florida and I haven't bought a brush yet so I'm doing this caveman style with my hands you know this is how me and appalls used to put the olive oil under falafels new years ago sliding it into an oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then I'm pulling it out and then I'm doing the flip-flop you know just turning them over they're not done yet and this is another reason you want them to be like these overinflated poker chip just gets because they'll get more surface on the pan you'll be able to get a little more color on you know they'll be able to toast up a little bit better on the pan but give them a flip boom back in the oven at 400 degrees still for 10 more minutes and then that'll be it you got some baked falafel are they as good as fried falafels no because they're not fried but they are good and they're easier to make you know they're delicious you know I love these things in a little pita sounds or on a plate with some other stuff which is how I'm going to eat them and look at this here they crispy on the outside and watch this here boom nice and steamy wholesome goodness and freshness in there and here's the important part watch right here special effect finger look at that it's still moist inside it's not a dried-out desiccated husk of a falafel it's a nice juicy tasty falafel just like a fried falafel but not fried serving it up with hummus you know cucumber tomato blah blah you know whatever you want you know put in a pita sandwich you have if you haven't had flops before super easy give it a go let me know what you think Bon Appetit thanks for watching I'm going to go ahead and I'll put out put this up to the homeless video because you know that's uh that makes sense alright
