 fresh pizza dough basil some tomato sauce olive oil and mozzarella cheese that can only mean one thing that's right today we're making pizza margherita alright so the first thing what we have over here is 16 ounces of dough I'm going to get it stretched out let's see how accurate I am yeah I think I know what I'm doing alright so first we're going to do the sauce the sauce is very basic all I did was take some mob plum tomatoes throw in a little bit of our salt pepper olive oil and actually some basil in there and we're going to get the spread around okay next to some basil now a lot of people there's a debate on whether to put the basil on before or after I actually deal with both times I'm going to put some on before and then we're going to top it with a little bit later on now we have whole milk yes you can only use whole milk mozzarella basically in blocks and now I'm going to put this in our preheated oven which is preheated at five hundred and twenty-five degrees so here we are about halfway through and we're now going to slide it off the pan put it directly on the rack and every couple minutes we're going to come here and turn it and we should be done pretty soon and here we go it is now done took about maybe 10-12 minutes last step is we're just going to top off some fresh basil on it and one last thing listen to this nice crispiness mmm thank you for watching everyone
