 hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a grilled chicken Caesar salad from scratch so some of my favorite recipes or suggestions that come from all of you so this recipe is going out to bubble puff 109 you wanted to know how to make a classic caesar and I'm going to show you how to do it so the first thing we're gonna do is create the marinade for our chicken in a dish you're gonna combine some olive oil some garlic lemon zest Italian seasoning and salt and pepper whisk that all up just until combined and then you're gonna add your boneless skinless chicken breasts make sure it's marinated on all sides so that the chicken is well coated you're then gonna cover and pop in the fridge and in meanwhile we're gonna create our croutons now if you ask me the croutons are the mark of any great Caesar salad so it definitely pays to make them from scratch don't go out and buy the croutons thinking you're gonna save a step because it will not be as good and when I show you how easy it is to make homemade croutons you'll never go back to the stuff in a box now when it comes to homemade croutons I really like to use ciabatta bread that's because if you slice into it you'll see it has all of those nooks and crannies and that's where all of your delicious homemade Caesar salad dressing is going to end up so it's a really great bread to use for something like this but if you can't find it you could also use a baguette or a French loaf that would work as well you're gonna slice the bread into about 1-inch cubes pop it in a bowl and to that you're gonna add some olive oil minced garlic and salt and pepper mix it all together and then turn it out on a cookie sheet you then are gonna bake at 375 for about 15 minutes you're looking for the croutons to crisp up and turn golden brown now for the dressing now a classic Caesar salad typically does have raw egg in it and I know that that can make some people uneasy so instead we're going to use some mayonnaise which is pasteurized so there's no reason to worry then we're gonna add the zest of one lemon and some lemon juice go ahead and give that a good whisk and then it's time for the anchovies now I know anchovies is another controversial subject when it comes to Caesar salad because a real traditionalist will say it is not a Caesar without the anchovies but I know that anchovies can also make people uneasy so what I like to do is instead of taking real anchovies and smashing them up I go right to the paste because then you tend to not even think about it when you measure out the anchovy paste just think of it as a nice flavorful paste then you're gonna add some Worcestershire sauce add some olive oil whisk it all together until combined and then the final step is to add about 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan cheese and that's it your dressing is done at this point your chicken is probably done marinating and it's time to grill it so go ahead and grill the chicken on all sides once it's done remove it and let it rest for about five minutes that will help retain all the juices into the chicken and make sure that your chicken doesn't dry out so a classic Caesar salad is made with romaine lettuce I love romaine lettuce because it has a wonderful crunch to it and the leaves are so big and beautiful so much so that I don't even like to cut it I like to serve the leaves whole on the plate and let each person cut the lettuce themselves that way you'll have a really beautiful presentation to our lettuce leaves we're gonna add our croutons and our dressing give that all a good toss making sure that all the leaves and croutons are covered and then what I like to do is portion that out onto plates and then add our chicken and one other little thing that I like to add which is not traditional at all but it's something that my mother loves in the Caesar salad she had it at a restaurant once and ever since then I've been throwing them into Caesar salads and that's some roasted pine nuts it's really delicious and adds one more texture to your salad then you're gonna finish the whole thing off with some more grated Parmesan cheese and some freshly cracked pepper and there you have it a homemade grilled chicken Caesar salad that will rival any you'll be able to order in a restaurant I promise give this one a try and let me know what you think and keep those requests coming I love hearing from you guys and if I know how to make it I'll definitely share the recipe I'll see you next time [Music] you
