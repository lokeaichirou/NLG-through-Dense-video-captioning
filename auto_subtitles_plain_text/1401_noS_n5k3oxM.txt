 hey guys this was a requested video by a subscriber I'm gonna show you guys how to make Korean style spicy pork aka a Superbowl game typically we just stir fry it with spice but I like to boil it first to drain the fat out so it's a little bit healthier alright let's get started okay so I have my pork here and I slice it in the middle so it's smaller pieces typically I don't like pork I use chicken so if you want you guys need chicken okie dokie so we have our green onions and regular onion I will list the specific measurements down below so make sure you guys check that out you I have hot chili paste low-sodium soy sauce we have sake this actually eliminates the smell of pork when you cook it we have pureed garlic and then we have hot chili flakes here and then you're gonna need a large bowl to mix everything up later on and I have my lettuce which I love to eat with my pork and then also my tofu which one a boil so I forgot to mention this earlier but we do need another large bowl to make our hot chili paste here I am adding 10 tablespoons of hot pepper flakes if you guys are sensitive to spice I would probably use six or seven or maybe even five but it all varies on the brands that you purchased the brand that I purchased for this one was extremely hot and I didn't know about it until after well even when I was cooking the pork when I was sauteing it I knew right away that it was going to be SuperDuper spicy because my nose was tingling because it was that hot okay so now we're going to add one tablespoon of hot chili paste to our hot pepper flakes you now we have to add five tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce to our bowl you guys can use regular soy sauce if you want you guys don't have low sodium but I prefer low sodium so now I'm just going to mix everything up together so it's all blended and evenly distributed all right so now it's time for the good part we're going to be adding two tablespoons of sake to our mixture okay so now that our water is boiling let's just add in the pork to drain out the fat if you guys want to you can repeat this step to take out the extra extra fat but I boiled it once only for five minutes because we're gonna be sauteing it later on anyway alright so after five minutes we're gonna drain the greasy greasy nasty water and we're gonna rinse the pork with cold water and put it to the side for a bit alright next step we're gonna boil our tofu for five minutes while our tofu is boiling we're going to add our pork to a large bowl and add three tablespoons of the chili paste that we made earlier now we're going to need half a tablespoon of sesame oil you now we're gonna add one tablespoon of garlic now we're going to need half a tablespoon of ginger and we're going to need four tablespoons of brown sugar now I'm adding one whole onion and just mixing everything up there is not really a specific measurement for the black pepper is just up to you guys your preference then I'm going to add one teaspoon of bamboo salt you last finales the green onion I have just three stalks of green onions but it's up to you guys you after we've wheel their toes we're just going to slice them up into little bite-sized pieces like so okay so we're almost done I'm just placing the tofu more on the plate you guys don't have to do this I just do it because I think it's pretty and then I'm just gonna finish off by chopping up some green onions and sprinkling them on top now it's time to devour this thing okay so now I'm going to use my lettuce and place my pork in there and eat it like so a lot of Koreans use lettuce and they also eat rice but I'm cutting out the rice for tonight I'm just gonna eat it with my lettuce and my tofu so what you do with the tofu is you just put it in have into little bite-sized pieces and then place a piece of meat on top and eat it like so there you go voila thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe if you guys decide to make this definitely took a picture and tag me on Instagram I would love to see your creation all right guys please thumbs up this video if you guys liked it and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already thanks bye
