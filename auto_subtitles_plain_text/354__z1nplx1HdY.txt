 hello everyone welcome today I'm going to show you how to make korean BBQ or what's called Colby and what we're going to start off with is the marinade that's where all the flavor is going to come from and that's what's going to tenderize our meat so what we're going to need for the marinade is pineapple and I've got some pineapple chunks here in syrup this is about half a cup I've got about a quarter cup of soy sauce about a quarter cup of sugar I've got to tape teaspoons of fresh ground pepper I've got some sesame oil about two tablespoons and I've got about two tablespoons of rice wine vinegar I've got some fresh garlic that we're going to crush into the marinade and I've got some onion what we actually need to do with the onion is we're actually going to grade it just like if we were grating cheese and that helps infuse the flavor into the marinade and into the meat so that should be enough onion for us so what we're going to start with the pineapple we're going to put the soy sauce in there going to put our sugar give it that nice sweet flavor that korean BBQ has nice pepper sesame oil and rice wine vinegar give it a nice little punch we're going to crush some garlic in there we don't want chunks of garlic just like the onion we want it fine so that we can just infuse it we're going to put about three or four cloves of garlic in here well that's a nice target god it smells good and we don't want to forget our onion get some the onion juice nice grated onion that already smells good ok we're going to blend all this together just real quick really we're just mixing it and kind of crushing them all right that's good we're going to let our marinade sit for a minute we're going to try to tenderize this beef a little bit now the beef that we use is the short rib and it's cut against the bone so short ribs a little bit tough and that's why we're going to tenderize it we're going to marinate it overnight spoke it a little bit just so that marinade can seep in to the meat easier that marinades going to be enough for between one to two pounds so if you're making more you need to double or increase the marinade accordingly we've got about a pound right there may be a pound and a half and we'll do one more nice we're going to take a gallon plastic bag and go ahead and put our move in there and we're going to get our marinade very nice perfect we're going to pour our marinade over our meat we're going to get all the air out I will put that in the refrigerator let it sit overnight every once in a while we'll flip it around to make sure all the new kits evenly marinated and then we'll be ready for the grill and we'll grill it okay soon as the meats ready i'll show you how to grill it okay so yesterday we prepare the marinade for our korean beef BBQ ribs or called colony also and today they're ready to hit the grill so we're going to take them out getting ready for the grill mmm they smell great and we haven't even cooked on yet okay so we're going to take these out we're going to put them on the grill and give them a little taste and see how they came out okay so we've got our fire on medium we're going to put our roots out on the car oh good and we're going to close that char for a little bit come back and check on them in about five minutes okay we're going to take a look at how our ribs are coming out there definitely cooking in the term got some nice and going to move them over to swap it for quite a time another two or three minutes and I'll be ready okay we're going to check our ribs nality should be ready and I use different tongues to take a nap than what I did tossing and turning them for the beginning I want to overcook them are under couldn't i think i'll get probably ready bullets let's take them inside for a taste okay now we've got our ribs inside we let them rest for about five to ten minutes so that all the juice doesn't just pour out when we cut it the meat reabsorbs the juice smells so good you can smell the soy sauce the pineapple the garlic everything that we put in there let's give it a real test give it a little taste oh it's so tender Oh perfect I hope you try this recipe you'll enjoy it and thanks for watching and we'll see you next time
