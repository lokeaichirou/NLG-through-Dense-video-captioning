 hi I'm Camille Parker from Camille's dish calm and today I'm going to show you how to make an easy minestrone soup and when I say easy I mean easy you are gonna love how simple this is you're not gonna believe it so all you need to do is start with a pot of water and turn it on get it going now the ingredients that we have over here our onions carrots celery and green beans some diced tomato we have some kidney beans a little pasta these are little orecchiette parmesan and some parmesan rind a bay leaf fresh parsley salt and pepper so all I'm gonna do is throw the ingredients into the boiling water or the simmering water and let him cook I learned this from my friend Alfredo : Naples and I was amazed when he showed me the soup he said I don't know why would you saute them you just throw them in there and they get all the flavor it's it's wonderful you're essentially making a stock inside your soup so onions carrots celery and green beans can all go in together just like that I will also add a little bit of salt to this as well as the tomatoes now the minestrone in general is a soup made with vegetables usually a bean a pasta and and or rice not and or pasta or rice and a tomato product so we're using fresh tomatoes to make it super simple on ourselves and we're gonna going to just let all the vegetables simmer in there together for a little while and then we're gonna add well first we're gonna add the parmesan rind and this is sort of a nice little trick to add some depth of flavor so if you have a parm piece of parm at your house go ahead and just cut off a piece of the rind which you would normally throw away anyway and go ahead and toss that right in your soup and that's only extra flavor and you're gonna get to utilize the entire hunk of cheese which you know you don't want to you don't want to waste any of his delicious parmesan so that's what we're gonna do okay we're also gonna add one bay leaf and then I'm gonna put a lid on the pot and let it simmer now the beans because they're already cooked I'm not going to add in till the end and the pasta as well the pasta we're gonna add the very last 10 minutes so that it's not overcooked when we want to eat our soup so we're just gonna leave that pot there for about 30 45 minutes and come back and check on it okay so now that all of our vegetables are very tender in our minestrone we're going to go ahead and add the beans and the pasta so what I want to do first is make sure that the broth is seasoned the way I want it because now the pasta is gonna go in and the pasta is gonna absorb the water from the broth and so we want it to be properly seasoned so that the pasta in the end tastes good tastes like the broth it's pretty good I'm gonna add a little tiny bit more salt it's always easier to add some than to take it away so I like to under sult first and continue to add so now I'm just gonna go straight in with my kidney beans you can use any kind of bean you like white beans are often used i like cranberry beans or borlotti beans as well and now I'm just gonna add the pasta and the pasta as well you can you can use whatever type of pasta you prefer these are little tiny orecchiette it means little ears and these are just teensy tiny little ones and I like them a lot for minestrone or other brothy sauces because they have that little cup so they so they kind of scoop up the sauce and the broth of the the juice sort of carry it to your mouth they're like your own little spoon so then I'm just gonna stir this up in here I'm gonna add a little bit of parsley as well now and then I'm gonna save some for the end so you're gonna get it cooked into the sauce and then you're going to get a freshness of it at the end as well so I'm gonna put a lid on it and let him cook until the pasta is finished so the minestrone will only get better with time so I recommend that if you have time you make it before you're gonna need it let it sit maybe even overnight and then heat it back up and add the pasta we've already put the pasta in and it's fully cooked now so now we're just gonna finish it off by giving it a little ladle right into the bowl you can see the pasta and all of those wonderful veggies and the green beans and a little bit of parsley as well we're gonna it's gonna be a nice hearty but but pretty light soup because we've we've put it together fairly quickly it will get more intense flavor the longer you let it sit so this is such a quick and easy way to do minestrone I mean you just throw it in a pot and let it simmer for a while and this is what you get this beautiful soup so now I'm just gonna finish it off with a little bit of grated parmigiano cheese of course we already had the rind in in the soup to begin and that's gonna add some depth of flavor and now we're just gonna give it another fresh sprinkle on the top it's gonna be delish and besides that we're gonna go with a little bit of parsley and there you have it easy minestrone soup I hope you enjoyed it I'm Camille Parker from Camille's dish calm
