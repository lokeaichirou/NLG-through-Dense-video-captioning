 hi welcome back to educate to calm my name is kia host today I'll be showing you how to make a very delicious quick noodle soup it is one of my secret for guys and gals who have no time to cook but love to eat so what you really need is of course you don't noodle okay but Japanese udon noodle Oh Korean unique an egg 1 egg 2 depending on how much you want and your soup you need a soup stock beef or chicken flavor whatever flavor you like okay it's a powdery form let's add flavor to the soup and of course you need three dried seaweed okay this one is a Korean seaweed with that and a pot of water so we're gonna heat up the water first I'll take about you know five minutes ten minutes and what we're gonna do is we are going to add the stock soup soup stock into about a teaspoon or a half a tablespoon and depending how strong flavor do you want okay I'm gonna just probably add a teaspoon of that in there and then what you want to do is add the dried seaweed right about a handful fresh seaweed and then add the egg okay and then the last step of course to add the need of noodle you want to keep the noodle in there for only maybe maximum three minutes okay you don't want to keep it too long or else then it'll be very I guess soft and you don't want that you want it as firm and hard as possible so about two or three minutes of heating after when it's boiled it's good okay let's get started I'll show you how to do it okay the first step is to turn up the heat to high and leave there for about five minutes okay and then what we're going to add is this soup stocks about a table I mean about a teaspoon worth okay well the water is heating up I'm going to add the soup stock powder look something like this I show you there we go okay so add about a teaspoon that's it and then we stir it when you start to boil the soup stock powder will dissolve quickly next step is take the dry seed then pick a point like a handful depend how much you want to eat but I take about two handfuls so there's one just stump in there I love see me taste really good now if you have onion you might want to add that as well right onion add more flavor no sweets like for some reason I don't have have onion in my fridge so I can't add in but I would advise to add onion in there cut into 1/4 so you have a 1 onion and you cut into 4 and just dump it in there okay I'm gonna wait till it's pulling up close it boil as you can see the boiling steaming up you only took less than five minutes to do that now I'm going to crack an egg and just put it in there wait for about 3 to 5 minutes so in about 10 minutes you get a nice soup and then just add you don't once you think that the egg which is about 3 to 5 minutes is boiled and I'm gonna add the UM read-only moodle's okay what I'm going to do is going to turn down the heat to medium okay so ray put in the Moodle Moodle this me ocean costs more than a buck right but it's really filling it is much better than the instant noodle because you get all the most of the natural material like the seaweed and the egg okay and of course if you're going you go as well it tastes more refreshing I know I don't like to use the word refreshing only the drinks but for this type of noodle soup it is refreshing okay just leave the udon noodle there for about a minute okay there it is a weight of a minute and it's ready so you can see in less than 10 min yet very delicious noodle soup very healthy you can see you see you eat in there you see eggs right like I said you might want to add onions and if you like tofu add tofu in that as well and you get a really really healthy type of Asian noodle soup okay very quick for those who are lazy to cook but love healthy food quick and healthy food there we go okay I can guarantee you when you eat this soup you feel refreshed like I said normally I don't use the word refresh unless it's a drink but for these type of noodle soup it is very refreshing okay and for me I love hot sauce so after I poured this out I'm gonna put some hot sauce in there and yeah that add even more flavor to the noodle soup okay now you don't have to use sudo noodle you can use Mian which is a Chinese style noodle you got between the Vietnamese noodle or virgin vermicelli noodle okay it's a once you boil it it becomes translucent or this one as well so different type of noodles you can even try spaghetti noodle in there but I really don't recommend it but you know you can try it if you're desperate for you know four ingredients and you don't have any other choice but again like I said all these noodles can be used okay and including the spaghetti noodles it I guess if you want to use it okay but let's give it a try let's try it out and see how it tastes okay so it's ready to pour in to my large bowl oh yeah look at that look at the matter what series in there I love see oh yeah now it doesn't look as pleasant how's it as a taste so it tastes much better than what it looks like I can tell you that okay so there it is I'm just gonna mix it a little bit make it look more pleasant for you guys do you have a look it's a huge amount of noodle soup let's just beep defeat two people but if you're hungry like me they can feed me yeah okay there it is it's done perfect meal for lunch or dinner unless you wanted for breakfast as well okay take less in ten minutes to do just get your ingredient like an egg seaweed noodle noodle any or any type of Chinese Vietnamese noodles or even a spaghetti noodle if you like you need the soup stock and maybe optional you can add onion and tofu in there but on that it's done okay let's enjoy the meal thank you God for the food amen let's eat now I like to try the seaweed first mmm it's so delicious mmm now if you're not a seaweed fan you
