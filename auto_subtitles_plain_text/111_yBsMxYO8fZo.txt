 we are making spring rolls and not just any spring rolls healthier baked one and not just healthy bait runs but jumbo ones for these spring rolls we need to marinate our chicken in some Chinese spices then we're gonna put it in our phyllo pastry with loads another crunchy colorful veg our pepper carrot spring onion okay so so much going we listen to a word of that right check in that case you can start the chicken okay right so Jamie you're gonna slice our chicken into a really thin strip no thinner the better means they're gonna cook a lot quicker then we're gonna add some flavoring to it so we got some Chinese five-spice she's gonna go into our bowl we're gonna put a tablespoon of sesame oil in a tablespoon of soy sauce then once Jamie's koley's chicken that goes in there and just give it a good mix up to marinate all of that chicken while you're doing that I'm gonna start on the merrier here want the garlic peeled and then crushed and our chili as well which we just cut around the pith and then all these ingredients gonna chop up nice and fine no more to get my hands in this I would yeah and that way you can massage you get all the little bits and pieces around and the long you can leave that the better a good sort a couple of hours but we're just gonna move straight on cuz enough flavors in there anyway this is quite a healthy spring roll so we're gonna add no extra oil to the pan we've got already a criticism we were on the chicken you know that's enough so if you just put that in there smoking any hot pan and sketch it and Scott layer and then if you can get rid of all the water cheating stuff and what their hands down Barrentine we finish our marinade a little bit of ginger as well peel enough for that keep that chicken moving every so often we've got our garlic we've got our chili now deliver the ginger as well which will just grate up Jamie if you get a clean form underneath you fresh coriander if you can chop the hut nice and fine and we're gonna divide all these ingredients in to half of our garlic and our ginger and chili in there and half in the other dip pot and coriander cilantro okay with some sesame oil some soy and some honey and that becomes our dip so do you give that a stir up and then we'll just leave that on the back for later got a few more veg to top up or do pepper into the carrot peel the carrot and then cut little peelings of it pepper we want really really thin strip and I just spring onions same thing thin thin strips so there we go I'm going to put my spring onions into the bowl and as soon as you guys done if you can put your and carrot in there as well why does this have to be so fit because we're gonna roll them up you want loads of all different flavors in there in each bit is just too chunky you won't end up with enough difference okay so a bit of everything while you're fishing that I knew to the chicken now I need to strip it up again so we've got bits like that you know stripping yeah they're really like shipping in the kitchen it's fine it's a landlord so there's a bit of preparation and chopping involved in this dish but once you've made them they can sit in the fridge for a little while until you need them so you can make them way ahead of time so all of our chicken will go in there the pepper and carrots get also chopped carrots but keep the whole thing a big mix-up and they will move everything to one side we need this space to do our rolling so how old jumbo are these Jumbo's patrols as big as our filo pastry will allow us we are going to buy this stuff already done because easier which one sheet and what we need to do is crack an egg so again traditionally with feeling patient in to use butter but this is our healthy version so we're gonna get away with an egg cool give that whisk up and give it a light brushing and then now jumbo bit plenty of this filling I'm going to pack it in so that you get plenty of that in there we fold in both edges like that and then we need to wet and dampen this because our egg acts as the glue as well and then this is difficult because it will start to rip at first okay then keep going keep going and it should hold its shape like a dock pancake like a duck pancakes about time you get to the end you got several rolls with this fantastic filling makes you got plenty of egg at the bottom stick it and there we go don't do one more of those now we can lay them on our baking tray and we just need to give this another brush with egg as soon as various done with brush well worth taking your time on these you can make them way ahead in advance okay and they just cook them off when you need them no no unless there's both of those J into a hot oven at 200 degrees Celsius until they go nice and crispy on the outside about 15 minutes look at those lovely and glossy crispy on the outside hopefully soft in the inside safe in there I think we'll cut into one of these you can see exactly what's going on in the inside they should because we're inviting does that egg they hold their shape perfectly there we go so you can see everything inside of there so I reckon if we take one of our big ones yeah okay and then one of those half cut ones you can see exactly what's going on there well it's our healthier version they're fake they're full of fresh crispy vegetables it's our jumbo chicken spring rolls sorted these are pretty awesome as they are but make sure you get a dip to make it even better yeah always quite hot always really quiet yeah now you're getting the flavors hmm definitely throw it jumbo yeah you know and I think I'll go back to small ones after this boys should have big you just don't go back there
