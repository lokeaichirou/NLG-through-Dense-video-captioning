 hey there I'm Hilah and welcome to Hilah cooking so one of the goals of our show is to sort of go over the basics kind of cooking 101 if you will so today I'm going to show you some excreme' legs SuperDuper easy and it's great things know how to make if you want to make breakfast for yourself or you want to make breakfast tacos or any number of things so we'll show you starting right now [Music] [Applause] so basically all you need is eggs and butter some people like to add milk or water to their eggs personally I don't really notice a difference when I do that so you can do it I don't know I think maybe the extra liquid just helps you break up the egg more better I don't really know I've heard explanations but I don't necessarily believe it anyway it is important to get some air mixed into your eggs so when you eat them you can use a fork I'm gonna use a whisk because it's kind of more fun but you just want to do it a lot and it starts to turn sort of a lighter yellow a lemon yellow get in there air get frosty on me and then we add a little salt and pepper and we ready to cook all right let that preheat while I get my SP in there that's salt and pepper and mix that up again and another very important thing when you're making eggs is to use the proper sized pan since I just have two eggs here I'm using my little baby skillet because I don't want them all spread out and then you end up with sort of a they cook too fast and then you get sort of tough eggs so I'm gonna cook slow and kind of deep I've got it on high heat right now while the butter melts and the butter is gonna melt and then it's gonna kind of film up a little bit and that's when I knew it's hot enough it'll start to bubble one final wham-bam and then i'm going to pour my eggs in okay now don't stir them right away let them acclimate to their new environment turn your heat down to medium-low and it's starting to cook around the edges here but I don't want to mess it just yet now I do I'm using a rubber silicone spatula you can use a metal spatula I want to be gentle with my baby eggs now I can start stirring them a little more vigorously to break up the little clumps and win there I like my eggs fully done but you want to take them off before they're to the point of your liking so like this looks turn that heat off and just keep stirring them around for just a few more seconds don't want to overcook and then they're they're still look a little moist I'm ready to plate go ahead and get them on my plate and perfectly cooked scrambled eggs all right see here we have large curds they're still moist and delicious and fluffy mmm perfect there you have it perfectly cooked eggs check out hilahcooking.com for more episodes and recipes and a little see you later on the flip side probably [Music] [Applause] [Music]
