 okay spaghetti carbonara looks great tastes great but it's all in the timing if you don't want to scramble those eggs so here is how to make it and for the ingredients you'll need two rashers of bacon enough spaghetti for two people some oil to fry one clove of garlic two eggs 125 milliliters of double cream 30 grams of finely grated parmesan and some fresh parsley to garnish so we're going to start by putting the spaghetti on so get yourself a saucepan pour in some boiling water and then bring it up to boiling point when your water's hot enough get your spaghetti and stick it into the saucepan leaving it to simmer away for however long it says to on the packet so whilst the spaghetti is cooking we're going to prepare the rest of the ingredients so get your garlic clove and peel it and then finely chop it with a sharp knife then stick it into a separate saucepan next get your two rashes of bacon and again with a sharp knife finely slice it into small pieces with all your bacon sliced you then need to chuck that into the saucepan along with the finely chopped garlic now stick that saucepan on a separate hob and then fry it with a little bit of oil for about five minutes until the bacon becomes nice and crisp and once the bacon and the garlic looks something like this we then need to prepare the cream sauce support 125 milliliters of double cream into a jug and then crack in your two eggs as well then also pour in your 30 grams worth of finely grated parmesan generously season the sauce with some pepper and then thoroughly mix it together with a fork so once the sauce is ready and the bacon and the garlic has been fried off we then need to wait for the spaghetti to finish cooking and when the spaghetti is done drain the water out through a colander and then return the spaghetti back into a clean saucepan now pour your fried up bacon and garlic into the saucepan with the spaghetti and then pour in the jug full of your cream sauce then using a couple of wooden spoons toss the spaghetti in the sauce to make sure it's all thoroughly combined together and finally serve your carbonara up onto plates garnish it with your fresh parsley and enjoy why not learn how to cook spaghetti perfectly or how to cook my yummy risotto recipe by clicking on one of the videos on the screen you
