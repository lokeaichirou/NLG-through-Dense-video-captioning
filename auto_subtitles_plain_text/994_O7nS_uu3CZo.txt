 here I'm going to show you how to cook a piece of foie gras first you want to get a pan hot I have a little piece of foie here about an ounce and you don't need to add any fat to your pan but you do want it to be quite hot and season it with a little salt and pepper and just put it right in there and all that fat is going to come out and it's going to smoke a little bit you might want to open up a window now you don't have to add any fat to the pan because Walker is basically pure fat it's going to let out a whole lot of it some people say they like to put butter in with foie I don't like to do that so all you want to do is caramelize it on the first side and then flip it and all you got to do is cook it until it is warm in the center you don't want to give anyone an undercooked piece of Barbera so now I'm going to get a piece of toast and my father is just about there I'll let it sit in the pan for a minute and then it's ready to eat and that's how you see a piece of foie gras
