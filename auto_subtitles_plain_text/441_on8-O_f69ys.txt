 hi I'm Diane Kamara and today I'm dishing with dye I'm gonna show you how to make spaghetti carbonara this is spaghetti and a creamy sauce made with Parmesan cheese and bacon and it's simple to make so let's get started I'm dish' with dye so you get this recipe started the first thing that you want to do is get a nice big pot of water and put it on the stove and bring it to a boil because you're gonna be cooking spaghetti I also like to use angel hair so whichever you choose and you're also gonna need pancetta and this is an Italian bacon and you see it's about I guess that's an eighth to a quarter inch thick and then over here I have some finely minced garlic now if you don't have pancetta you can also use regular bacon for this it is a little bit more salty and it does render a little bit more fat so you might just have to like drain it a little bit when we get to that point but it'll taste the same in the end so whatever floats your boat now what I'm gonna do with this bacon is just cut it into some small squares just like this the Bacon's gonna give this sauce like a nice kind of smoky salty flavor it's really delicious and this is something that's so quick and easy you can easily do this on a weeknight so the other things that I have for the sauce are some grated Parmesan cheese and I have some eggs here and a little bit of heavy cream now the heavy cream is optional my husband likes this sauce a little extra creamy so I include it but you don't have to traditional carbonara sauce does not have cream in it so whichever way you want to do it it's up to you so now my water's coming to a boil so I'm going to take the spaghetti salt my water and throw it in now while your pasta is cooking you want to take a pan put that over medium heat and then add a little bit of olive oil in and then take your chopped pancetta and put that into the pan now if you're using regular bacon you don't need to use the olive oil I just like to throw a little bit in the pan with the pancetta because sometimes it doesn't have as much fat as others cook this down until the fat renders and it becomes nice and crispy while my pancetta is cooking and my pasta is boiling away I'm just gonna make the sauce real quick and it's very simple so into a bowl add the eggs and lightly whisk them then take that freshly grated Parmesan cheese and add that in along with several grates of freshly ground black pepper now this is another really important part of the recipe it just really makes a big difference in the way this is gonna taste and then if you're gonna be using the heavy cream now's the time to add it if not then you're skipping this part and then just go ahead and whisk the whole thing together until it's really thoroughly combined and that's it that is your sauce right there and this is gonna be wonderful so now I think everything's just about done so we're to get over there and throw the whole thing together now your pancetta is nice and brown and all the fat has rendered take that finely minced garlic and throw that into the pan and just give that a nice spin around you're just gonna cook this for about 30 seconds just until it becomes very fragrant you don't want to brown it this is gonna add loads of flavor to this pasta before you take the pasta out of the pot grab about 1/3 of a cup of the pasta water and set that aside now my pasta is done I like to take it directly from the pot and I'm gonna put it right into the pan yes like that and I do that because I like that little bit of extra water in there I think it helps to keep the pasta from being too dry and toss the pasta to thoroughly coat it with all the fat in the pan take the pasta and pour it right into this nice Bowl look at all that beautiful pancetta in there it smells amazing so now I'm gonna finish the whole thing up so I have this piping hot pasta here and it was al dente so now it's continuing to cook in there and I have the sauce that we already made and this little bit of hot pasta water so I'm gonna take this hot pasta water and I'm gonna pour about half of it right into my egg and cheese mixture just like this and I'm tempering the eggs with this hot water because when I put this sauce into my spaghetti I don't want the eggs to scramble and this is gonna make it a little extra creamy too so just about half of that is enough to warm it up a little bit so now pour it right into the pasta just like this look at that it's beautiful and creamy and then go ahead and toss it around now you want to be quick about it cuz the piping hot pasta is cooking those eggs making this really creamy sauce now it looks a little bit wet right now but that pasta is gonna go and absorb a lot of this sauce so you're just gonna get everything really thoroughly coated so now I have a little bit of fresh parsley here so I'm just gonna go ahead and just chop this off real quick and now we're just gonna plate this so get your serving bowl and go ahead and put that in there and a nice mound look at that with a beautiful pancetta in there and now a few extra grates of freshly ground black pepper just right over the top just like that I also like to put a little bit of extra fresh Parmesan cheese on there oh this is like a killer dish look at that that's gorgeous and then to finish it off just a little of this fresh parsley and now it's time to take a bite right in there with all that pancetta that's where I want to be look at that mmm garlic that smoky pancetta the pepper the Parmesan cheese for those few simple ingredients that you put into this dish it gives you a huge payoff go get the recipe on my website edition with DICOM and I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious I'll see you next time bye now
