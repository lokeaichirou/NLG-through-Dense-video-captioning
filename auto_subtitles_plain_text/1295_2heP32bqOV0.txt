 hi everybody today I'm going to attempt to make a ghoulish recipe and usually these recipes calls for about three pounds of meat and I'm trying to make it so it's like it I could have a smaller portion and I went with one pound of meat right here so first let's start by cutting this meat and two cubes and we'll Pat them dry and we'll put some paprika on it and we'll go from there pop Rica okay nice piece all six side but okay that's it good so next up we'll just Pat them dry because we're gonna Brown grab some paprika about a tablespoon of also some fresh ground pepper great so now let's set this aside we're gonna we're gonna add had left over so we need one medium onion just sliced and we'll break it up Paris so for this we're gonna use a little bit of olive oil just saute the again with this medium of high to start and just just you know sprint to people so they're happy together all right so now that there are semi-translucent we're going to just move them to a separate and by the way after this I'm using the Cuisinart 6/4 reply and really a really good partner the next step is to sear the the meat so for that we're gonna put the heat on high and this thing is starting to I'm just going to transfer the meat here all four sides of to be all sides of the meat it's going to take us about five minutes we got nice clearing here at this point I'm not going to have water we're going to add about 1/3 of a can of a 6 ounce tomato paste and while lower they have not returned we're going to add the onions a quarter of a teaspoon of human and he can add either chicken consomme or vegetable and I like to use this brand that's the bull some soup and seasoning mix and it's really a thrill has a lot of flavor about two tables go ahead and skinning up make sure you pick up the bits and pieces from bottom and we're going to bring it down to a simmer go ahead cover the pan and this can go like that for about an hour and a half so I'm going to set the time maybe an hour time I would come back after an hour and check the tenderness of the meat and if it needs a little more cooking then just continue all right so it's been about thirty minutes and I'm gonna give it a good steer here smells great all right so the one hour and ten minutes or so as past and I iced steered the pot from every 30 minutes or so and I don't think it's ready I think it does need another half hour but I'm just gonna grab one I'm gonna cut into it and taste it and by the way is temperature focus focus nice yum-yum Oh oh goodness good absolutely I think it's actually writing it's nice so yeah this is now this is ready and this was my recipe for DM I'm Gary and Goulash using the quizzing art it's just six quart three ply pot so if you enjoyed this video please thumb up subscribe to my channel putting your collards if you have a better recipe try this recipe you love it please put it in the comments and I'll catch you in the next video bye
