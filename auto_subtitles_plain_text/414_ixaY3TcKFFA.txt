 hi guys it's off here in this video I'm going to show you guys how to make my Asian fried chicken it's just like any other fried chicken recipe except it uses more Asian ingredients and like with most American fried chicken they usually soak the chicken and buttermilk or maybe in a saltwater brine and that's just the real main difference with Asian fried chicken versus your American fried chicken this is a collaboration video with Rosie over at I heart recipes she has a really great collection of southern food so food yummy food you guys are gonna love it there and in her video she's going to show you guys how to make her southern red beans and rice just a great side dish to have with my Asian fried chicken I know y'all Cambodians you're like where's the papaya salad ad where's the sticky rice at but you know what you gotta switch it up a little bit and if you like a little more exciting you know break up the same old monotony of what your daily eating routine is okay that's all I'm sayin give it a try I'll post the link to her recipe along with her youtube channel at the end of the video and also down in the description box below right let's start frying up some chicken here is my 2 pounds of chicken that I've cleaned and patted dry so I've cut them up just like this I got my little drumstick piece here drumettes get the little wing part here now I'm going to go ahead and add in my soy sauce 2 teaspoons I need about 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce so there's 1 3 a little bit of black pepper I'm also going to add in some sugar so I'll pop a teaspoon of sugar just mix to combine I'm going to mix this all together and I'm going to let this sit at room temperature 1/2 an hour while the chicken is marinating we're going to go ahead and work on our flour mixture so I have four three tablespoons of all-purpose flour you need three tablespoons of potato starch and three tablespoons of rice flour two pinches of salt two teaspoons of garlic powder two teaspoons of onion powder 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning quarter teaspoon of white pepper finally a quarter teaspoon of black pepper so I have everything that I need to do here but I did forget to show you guys two things forgot to add half a teaspoon of Italian so you've learned that Italian seasoning which consists of like your rosemary sage thyme all that jazz tastes really great with the fried chicken also it would add a little bit of chili powder 1/4 teaspoon of fat it's not going to make it too overly spicy but it's definitely sound like a little bit of a nice kick kind of like a background spicy note so I have here my chicken all with my hands here your hands are your best tools so the trick here to not get too overly crazy messy is to have one hand in your dry ingredients in one hand in your chicken because if you mix it too it's just to get clumpy and messy that it's kind of too messy for me so I'm just going to take my left hand throw it in my mixture and I'm just going to do a couple at a time so tan is always going to stay out of the flour mixture tap off the excess turn this one over top off the excess so here's what your chickens going to look like so I'm just going to go check on my oil then we can fry these baby that so I'm going to check if the oil is hot the good ol Asian way I'm going to dip the end of my chopstick middle here and if you see little bubbles form around it that means my oil is quite enough to fry my chicken if you don't do it this way obviously you can use a thermometer I would say about 350 it's good for this done with the back come on that looks amazing now it's time to taste smells so good look so good take a bite damnit sorry guys my neighbor is cutting and mowing their lawn right now something it's kind of loud my bad hmm wow that is good this is seriously delicious move it a little bit every day saltiness slightly sweet a little bit spice not be spicy really and I can almost I think that's a weedwacker and that Cajun seasoning adds a nice little bit of color too because of the paprika in it Wow oh now dipped in some sweet chilli sauce this beats going out to eat hording fried chicken any day hmm don't forget to check out my friend Rosie over I heart recipes hope you guys enjoyed the video thanks for watching bye
