 basic mutton curry hi man openeth welcome rue sanjeev kapoor khazana and a warm welcome to a series of cooking for beginners now what do we do let's make a basic mutton curry mutton curry is something that you can make on any occasion be it just your everyday cooking or if you have some unexpected guests at home this curry is so easy that you can make it in the pressure cooker and it doesn't take too many preps you want to have your is basic spices will quickly run through the ingredients for this basic mutton curry I need mutton on the bone potatoes tomatoes onions ginger paste coriander powder red chili powder garlic paste garam masala powder turmeric powder bay leafs chopped coriander leaves whole black peppercorns cinnamon black cardamom green cardamom cloves salt and some oil so what I'm going to do now here is I have a pressure cooker in which I am going to add some oil now mutton being a tough meat takes longer to cook so it's always advisable to use a pressure cooker but there are some people who do not prefer using a pressure cooker I'm fine with that you can do it in a vessel specially in a thick bottom vessel where you just have to keep on sorting in the masala and then let the mutton cook on medium heat if you put it on very high heat the mutton may get a little burnt so I prefer using a pressure cooker so that once you have everything in and you have put the lid you are really free to do your other things at home especially when it comes to Martin I prefer using a pressure cooker but if it's chicken or any other meat doing it in any other pan is absolutely fine okay so the oil is valuated after the oil is heated we have to first add the whole masala we first add the bay leaf then we'll add some cloves don't add too much of the whole masalas because it's very powerful in flavor and apart from that we are also going to add garam masala powder towards the end so after cloves you've added green cardamom we'll just add one black cardamom about an inch of cinnamon some black peppercorns that's it and once you saute this you'll automatically get the flavor of all the whole spices in this whenever you have to make any curry like this first you add in the whole spices and then you add onions tomatoes and all the other pastes so you see this nicely getting sorted so after this we'll add onions I have onions which are finely chopped the reason that I prefer chopping Manion spine is that the Browning happens faster you see this more the onions better will be the body or the consistency of your mutton gravy but you have to wait for a while till this actually gets golden brown in color and this may take anywhere around seven to eight minutes if your onions are finely chopped and you will find a lot of other recipes where they use onion paste now you could also do that so what happens when you grind an onion first the water gets evaporated and then the browning happens so instead of doing that is better to chop it up like this and start your cooking in the meanwhile let me also tell you one thing these mutton pieces that I have your are nicely bashed and mutton whenever you buy make sure it is bright red in color never buy pale looking mutton you see this it needs to be absolutely bright red in color which means it is fresh similarly with seafood prawns have to be white fish has to be absolutely white and if a fish smells fishy which means it is not good so let's get back to the onions you see this now it started getting pink which means it will start browning in a while and once it starts drowning do not leave the pan because it is born very quickly so we just want nice golden onions after which we'll add in the ginger garlic paste now what happens is if you add in the paste right now the onions will not Brown so we have to first Brown the onions and then add whatever other spices that you want to add okay now we are going to be adding tomatoes to this a lot of recipes also suggest using yogurt so if you were to add yogurt in your recipe avoid the tomatoes because if you add yogurt and the tomatoes the gravy will go sour and we do not want a sour gravy so it's up to you I prefer using tomatoes because the color goes nice and red apart from tomatoes I also use a Kashmiri red chilli powder which also gives very good color to the gravy okay so you see this the onion have started turning golden we will now start adding the ginger-garlic paste first because that also takes some time to cook the raw flavor of garlic and ginger has to go or else it doesn't leave a very good flavor lingering on your tongue so this needs to be sorted along with the onions if you are attending to the pan continuously you can leave the flame slightly high but if you are doing your other things also in the kitchen make sure this sorting is done on low heat okay you see this this is just perfect now we start adding all the other dry spices again I have lowered the heat because spice is born very fast since it's in powder form this is coriander powder red chili powder kashmiri red chilli powder actually turmeric powder and just give it a mix after you have sorted all the masalas now let's add the mutton pieces like this one by one we will add the mutton here please make sure that the mutton is fresh a day old mutton also will take longer time to cook of course if we get cooked but it will definitely take a longer time after you have added the mutton let's add some salt here and this needs to be sorted really well with all the masalas we have yet not added as our tomatoes that we will add after we see or the mutton will I believe in searing the mutton along with the masalas the searing of this mixing needs to be done on high heat or else the mutton will start leaving water and we do not want that to happen at this stage so make sure the flame is high and you have to keep on mixing this in the meanwhile let's do something let's add some coriander also your I prefer sauteing coriander leaves rather than adding it just as a simple garnish so let the coriander also get roasted in the masala and here we have to add but it was after you have added all of this mix it again nicely since we are using the kashmiri red chilli powder you find the colour going red and a red mutton curry definitely looks very appetizing so after you have mixed everything well it's now time to add my toes so let's add tomatoes here and some more salt we've already added some salt in the beginning so now a little less and again just give it a mix we have to saute this till the tomatoes go slightly soft and that's when we'll add water and let this cook on medium heat so you see the tomato they've gone soft let's add water and so after you have placed the lid we will cook this till about 6 missiles are given out on medium heat of course if it's on high heat it could be anywhere around 10 to 12 whistles but 6 whistles are needham heat the mutton will be done but the mutton has to be very fresh a day old or a day or two old mutton takes more time to cook of course it will cook but maybe about 10 missiles after the whistles are given out let the pressure cooker rest for a while till all the pressure settles down and then we will see how the mutton curry looks right now we'll wait for all the whistles to be given out okay so now let's see how this mutton curry looks open the pressure cooker after the whistle or the pressure has settled down the color is perfect let's switch on the heat now we have to add two ingredients here one is the garam masala powder garam masala powder should always be added towards the end because we added for flavor and fragrance so in this case it is just for flavor and fragrance and this needs to be added towards the end so little bit of garam masala powder and coriander we will add after we serve this the potatoes also have coat has got slightly mashed into the gravy this is exactly how we should make it this is like Melton mouth mutton curry just take this and hmm just effect very soft mutton why because it was very very fresh spice levels are just as needed the color is perfect the tankyness is right there this is just fine let's switch off the heat okay so you scoop the mutton curry out in a serving bowl and we'll garnish this with some chopped coriander that's it simple or basic mutton curry is ready serve this with piping hot steamed rice and make this recipe just the way I have made it and you'll be very proud of yourself
