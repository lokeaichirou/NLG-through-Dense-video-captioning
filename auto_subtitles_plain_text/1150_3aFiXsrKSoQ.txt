 hey guys welcome back to the DS Mediterranean kitchen today we're going to be making one of the traditional favourites of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine shish kebabs yes we're making shish kebabs they're easy they're simple you can grill them you can make them in the summertime you can make them in the wintertime any time you want you can make shish kebabs now get this recipe and all of my other Mediterranean recipes on my website at Dede medCom you can join my Twitter and you can join my facebook and you can chitchat with all kinds of people who like Mediterranean food now we're going to go over the ingredients and show you how to put it together now the ingredients are pretty simple we have some green peppers cut into nice cubes red pepper tomatoes onions you have your skewers which mean sheesh that's where the word shish kebab comes from this is the shish and I have some filet mignon that's cubed up into nice size pieces I like to use filet because it's lean it's very tender we have some salt black pepper and of course seven spices now some people like to use on steel skewers and or aluminum skewers and some people like to use what's yours which tears are so much easier because you can throw them away when you're done but what you need to remember is if you're going to use wood skewers make sure you soak them in water before you use them that way the wood won't burn while you're barbecuing this is kebabs now if you don't want to get filleted and I know you're probably thinking oh my god-dd it's so expensive it's very well worth it but if you don't use fillet try and use another meat that's a little bit Marbley with some fat because other meats aren't as tender as a fillet so you're going to need the fat and the other needs to keep the meat tender um Chuck would be too dry try using thigh meat like me um maybe the bacne any kind of neat that has a little bit of fat to it would go great if you're going to use the filet you don't need to have a lot of fat in the meat because the filet itself is very tender now we have our vegetables that are cubed some people also like to use mushrooms different kinds of vegetables whatever vegetable you like you can put it in between the meat as a barbecue we have our filet that's cubed I'm going to add about a teaspoon and a half of salt just like that we're going to add some fresh black pepper trying to use fresh black pepper it has a much more flavorful taste didn't you get it ground already and these are pretty cheap you get them at any store for a couple of bucks so just like that we're also going to add a teaspoon or two five seven spices some spices gives it a nice worldly flavor I'm also going to add just some olive oil it helps the meat um Brown nice and crispy while it's on the grill so just a couple tablespoons of olive oil now we're going to mix this up yes use your hands it's okay to use your hands if you don't like using your hands and just wear gloves while you're cooking with the meat just like and then what we're going to do is we're going to alternate the chunk of meat with a chunk of vegetable now at this point you want to make sure your grill is preheating you want it on a medium high heat because this is very tender meat so you're going to cook it just like you would cook a filet steak if you like medium rare even cooking medium rare so I'm going to leave about an inch at the end of the skewer poke in your meat I'm going to use a piece of onion and I'm going to put it's all up to you you can put alternate meat but you will meet vegetable you can do two pieces of meat one piece of vegetable whatever you like so just like that see put it on a plate and then we can do some peppers and this one is green pepper and these are nice Christmasy colors too so if it's around Christmas time you can use the red and the green see Christmas colors it's kind of fun green pepper put another piece of meat just like that see how pretty that is so you just keep going until you're done and then when you want to barbecue them you want to barbecue them if you like them on medium well you want to do about seven minutes on each side if you like it medium rare you want to do about five minutes on each side so just like that I'm going to finish these up and I'm going to barbecue them I'm going to show you how to plate them up we are done grilling I want you to take a look at this I just serve them over some pita bread you can serve them over some brown rice with the vermicelli noodles that recipes on my website as well see how they get all nice and grilled look at this how that comes apart it's so tender mmm it's so juicy unbelievable the best grilled kebabs you will ever have you have to try this it's still simple even thus winter time even if it's summertime even it's raining turn up that grill try these shish kebabs you are going to love it it's recipes on my website didi my comm enjoy this and join me again at dnews my dream kitchen
