 welcome to clean eating with Claudia in hospice I'm in the kitchen demonstrating how to make baked quinoa falafel patties these falafels are wonderful because they're packed full of fiber protein and our low calorie don't write in any of the directions or ingredients just click on this link that's available in the video description this will send you to have spent calm but we have everything laid out for you let's get started begin by preheating your oven to 350 degrees I'm taking 1 15 ounce can of chickpeas that I've drained and I'm putting them directly into the food processor and to the chickpeas we're going to add one clove of finely chopped garlic and just add that right on into the food processor with your chickpeas and I'm going to blend these together for about 10 to 15 seconds in the food processor your blended chickpeas and garlic should look a little something like this let's combine all of our falafel ingredients together I'm going to start with the chickpeas that I blended in the food processor and we'll add them into a separate Bowl just make sure you scrape all of the chickpeas out of your food processor bowl next I'm going to add 1/4 of a cup of finely chopped red onion next I'm going to add 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley and then I'm going to add 1/8 of a teaspoon to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper just for a little extra heat you can't omit this ingredient if heat is not what you want for your falafels I'll go ahead and give all of these ingredients a quick mix and next I'm going to add 1/3 of a cup of cooked quinoa and I'm also going to add one wisp egg to the mixture as well now if you want to make this a vegan recipe you can certainly just add one tablespoon of an egg replacer next I'm going to add a liberal amount of pink Himalayan sea salt and cracked black pepper about a quarter of a teaspoon of each I'm going to mix all the ingredients together until we get the consistency of a thick paste and this is what it should look like when you're all done mixing you can use a baking sheet but I'm going to be using a shallow skillet now whatever it is that you decide to use just be sure that you give it a generous spray with a nonstick cooking spray now to form our falafel patties I'm going to take about two tablespoons of the falafel mixture into my hands and I'm going to form it into the shape of a traditional falafel patty as you see here place it on your baking sheet and continue until all of the mixture is gone this recipe will yield about nine to twelve falafel patties just depending on the size that you make them I'm going to pop the falafels into the oven for approximately thirty minutes halfway through I'm gonna take the falafels out and flip them over a place ease back into the oven for an additional 15 minutes to finish baking and this is what your quinoa falafel patties will look like when they're all done these falafel patties are delicious on their own they also make a great addition to any salad but tastes even better when they are paired with my Greek yogurt sauce be on the lookout because I'll be posting this recipe real soon if you enjoyed this recipe be sure to check out my blog on past its website there you'll find additional recipes as well as complete workouts meal plans to lose or gain weight and are complete 30 to 90 day fitness programs do me a favor and please be sure to subscribe to this youtube channel follow us on Twitter and like us on Facebook for the best daily motivation this has been clean eating with Claudia in hospit and remember to eat clean and train dirty
