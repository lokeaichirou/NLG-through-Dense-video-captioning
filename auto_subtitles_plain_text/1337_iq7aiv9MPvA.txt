 hello everybody welcome back to my channel my name is Keisha I blog every day at Kay Jagger's dot-com the link to my blog is below so today I am back sharing a recipe a crock-pot recipe that is for a delicious soft tacos stack that you can either help along on the stove and take minimal time in the crock-pot or you can do it all in the crock-pot I'm going to explain the process all the way through and this is a little bit unconventional in the in the sense of how I'm sharing it I'm not going to go through all of the different ingredients of Brunt I'm going to share them as we as we need them throughout the video and I will have everything written out in a corresponding blog post that you will be able to get to by clicking the link below in the downbar and you'll be able to have the recipe in pool that is printable for your family to enjoy so let's get started I'm going to show you how to make this delicious top of a stack so even though this is a crock pot meal one of the nice things about this particular dinner is you don't have to get it in the crock-pot super early if you don't want to so what I like to do for this recipe is go ahead and get the beef cooked up with the onions that way it doesn't have to be in the crock-pot all day you don't have to transfer and then layer the taco stack up you can layer it simply out of this pot so all I have in here is about 2 pounds of cube steak and if you did want to make it you know in the crock pot all the way you would cut your cube steak up and put it in your crock pot with one onion and then you would add some sauce and I will explain that in a minute the enchilada sauce turn that on and let it cook for about five hours until your meat is nice and tender so you can do that you will have to take it out transfer it and make sure that you know you have another container ready so you can layer it up but this only takes a couple minutes you can go ahead and cook it on the stove just the meat while you get everything else ready and it makes it a little bit faster and a little bit easier but still if you have a game night or something going on you can prepare this a few minutes ahead of time get it in the crock pot come back a couple hours later or maybe even just one hour later and dinner is completely ready so very very easy to do I'm gonna finish cooking up this meat and I'll show you how I assemble it in the crock pot you could use hamburger by the way sorry about all the steam you could use hamburger by the way and that is a cheaper alternative but I found this chopped steak on sale and I use this in the husband approve steak sandwiches and I love it and I find it just a little bit better but you could definitely use just a ground round if you wish be sure to drain it though so rather you're cooking your meat on the stove or in the crock pot when it is done you will need to add 1/2 can just a half a can of the enchilada sauce I'm using mild and then I added a 1 can of the traditional refried beans mix that up you can do this totally in the crock pot and then transfer it to a bowl if you wanted you know not to have to cook the meat on the stove but you're still going to have to mix in that half a can of Ancelotti sauce and the refried beans and that is what you got so now let's get to making our taco stack so in my crock pot I have the other half of the mild and talati sauce and you just put it on the bottom and I'm gonna put one soft tortilla down I'm just gonna kind of spread it around make sure it's got enchilada sauce under it and then we are gonna start building our taco stack you're gonna spread some of that meat mixture on that first taco stack try to get it as even as you can and you're gonna have to you know work out of your bowl or skillet whichever you're using and then you're gonna add some cheese just like that and another tortilla and you're gonna keep doing that until you've used up all your meat and I usually like to try to at least get six of the tortillas in sometimes more so I'm going to continue building this up and I'll show you how I finish it okay so I believe I asked seven tortillas you can see they're all stacked up so let's recap for a second we have half a can of the mild and shilada sauce at the bottom of the crock pot we started out stacking soft tortilla on top of that enchilada sauce we layered in our beef and onion mixture which for me is beef cube steak with an onion we've added the other half can of the mild and a lot of sauce our refried beans we stacked it up on soft tortillas with in the crock pot and a cheese in between each layer and now I'm at the top so how I like to top this is with the Velveeta cheese sauce this is the queso it comes in these little packets like so and you're just going to pour one or two over the top usually I put two my husband loves this meal this is one of his favorite meals of all time and I just squeezed this out it's kind of hard to do I'm going camera of one hand but I just like to squeeze this out and over the top and cover the entire top of the the soft taco so you can see that it's covered in the gooey gooey delicious well beated queso cheese you could certainly make your own queso you can make your own refried beans do what you wish you can shred your own cheese I'm showing you a quick way to do this but you could certainly you know add your own special touches so here it is I have the Babita cheese on top put my lid on and from this point dinner is done in basically either one hour on high or even one hour on either which way it's just gonna melt those cheeses warm everything up but you could keep it on low and your family you know can enjoy it whenever you were back from a game or back from church or whatever on any kind of night it will be basically done in one hour but you can keep it on warm as long as you need to and even on low it will probably be done in close to one hour maybe one and a half hours to two hours but I like to put it on high when I'm home and get all those flavors mixed together and warmed up together and after about one hour you could certainly serve this up and I will show you how I do that next so I just took my knife cut into it got a piece out and it is such a simple delicious meal it can stay on low in the crock-pot for a while and it will stay warm for your family especially if you know you have people running in and out this is such a delicious easy meal to make I'm going to show you how I played it up next so this is how we serve it up you can see the different layers I have a big dollop of whipped cream on top some salsa and also a couple scoops I just used my melon baller inside of a avocado and that is our dinner and I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe I promise if you make it for your family they will love it as much as my family does you can use ground beef you can use chicken you can use cube steak whatever makes you happy you could certainly do and again you can start this
