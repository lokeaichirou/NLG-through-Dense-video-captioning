 it's talking you about making sliders because I got to starch these beautiful potato rolls right here you want to make sure you get yourself a nice roll I'm gonna start with these rolls next I went to the deli and it got some Boar's Head American cheese if you're gonna go good why not go the best of course here I got some ground round let's get started all right so what I've done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil if you have the really thick stuff then just so you can use one but unfortunately I don't right now so the next step is take your ground beef now you're making the slider so what you want to do is you want to take your ground beef I'll lift it up a little bit and smooth it out but you want to make sure it doesn't really stick you're just kind of smoothing it out to the point to where you're gonna cut it into little square patties once you've got it all flattened out and you can use a rolling pin just use it lightly and I would recommend using waxed paper instead of foil but I don't have that not a problem you can still use it it will come off but wax paper is better because it slides off easier what you're doing now is that you've made it flat enough as you're making those actual beautifully thin slider patties you don't want them too thick otherwise you're just eating a small thick burger if you like it that way go with it but just for sliders so here we go take a knife and just start taking the edges like that now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties so don't think that you're wasting any meat and as you go along gently use your knife start cutting the edges and moving it inside all right I'm gonna fish this and I'll get back to you in a moment and here's a basic idea of what it looks like just simple square patties you can salt them now I prefer to salt them after they come off just because it's all usually falls off so now you want to just toast those buttons put them under your broiler for like thirty Seconds to a minute depending on how high have the rack and how strong your broiler is but look how beautiful alright so we got the burgers ready let's put them on the pan here yummy there you go there's your sliders let's finish them off really quick you
