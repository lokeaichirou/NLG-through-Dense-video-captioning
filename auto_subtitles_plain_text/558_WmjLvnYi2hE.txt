 hi my name is Rolla and welcome to eating with Rula today we are going to make a delicious chip it's called hummus or as you may know it hummus this dish is nutritious and as I said very delicious and can be served with anything kebabs or any other main dish you'd like it to be served x2 or you can have it as an appetizer if your friends call you last minute and they decide to come it's quick and easy to make and I promise you they will love it as much as you so why don't we get started first thing is I use a food processor because I prefer because it grinds the chickpeas very well so that it's fine a good house to me should be fine and smooth smooth like butter I shouldn't taste or I shouldn't feel I should say the little bits of chickpeas that you can have if you're not using a good food processor if you don't have a food processor then by all means use your blender next thing we're going to need is one can of chickpeas 15.5 pounds can of chickpeas we are going to dump it into the food processor there is no rhyme or reason to how you make this and plump it all the ingredients in here and put it on and it's done that's how quick and that's how easy it is the next ingredient is the half as half of one lemon of freshly squeezed lemon juice put it in there garlic we're gonna put one small clove we're not going to put anything too big because we'll have barely very very garlicky hummus and if you like it garlicky that's something we'll do that's later so a smoke little garlic a third of a cup of water 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt and the last ingredient which i think is one of the most important ingredients is tainted Tina is a sesame paste made of ground Sesame's you can find Tina in any middle-eastern store or Mediterranean store now when you open up your bottle of tina you're going to notice that there is a thick layer of oil on the top you want to take the same tablespoon that you're going to need for the homeless and you're going to stir it around to make sure that your oil is well incorporated into the sesame paste once you do that we're gonna take nine tablespoons of tahini make sure your tablespoons are filled and just dump it on there seven eight and nine Tina if you put too much it's usually not a problem or if you put too little it's not a problem so don't ever be afraid of that and then that's it you've put all your reasons that you're going to need for this into your food processor or blender what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna put the food processor on and leave it on for about two to three minutes because I want my the most smooth the smoother as I said the better so I'm going to leave it on I do other things in the kitchen and then I'll come back to you and come back to it and we'll see how it's looking this looks about done it's perfect it's smooth just the consistency you want right here what I want you to do at this point is I want you to try your hummus because you should see if if you want more salt lemon garlic or Tim I think you're gonna love it as it is but I also want you to remember that reason why I'm asking you to try it also is because food is a blessing it is a gift it is such a pleasure and you should enjoy eating as much as I do and that's why I want you to try it and make it taste as good as as can be so you're happy with what you're eating okay but that said we're going to take this on over to here and I'm gonna put this onto this appetizer platter you can really put your hummus on anything but I chose this to show you how I would serve it if I had coming over so right here I have some pita chips some pita chips that I need and you can watch my video on how to make these pita chips they're very easy and delicious so we take our hummus and we're gonna put it here on our butter spread it out and then prepare to feast so I'm gonna decorate it a little bit i am i put some chickpeas aside just so i could decorate my homeless a little bit and it's i put it on top then i add a little bit of color paprika it doesn't give any taste just some color to your hummus and then you're set you have a gorgeous of hummus and pita chips but if you prefer by the way not to have pita chips and you want just pita bread you can do that as well i think either one it tastes delicious and also again back to the whole thing of making what you like try your hummus as is without you know how we prepared it here and see how you like it then what i want you to do is take your olive oil because you can serve it with or without olive oil it is no right or wrong way put it here on the corner of the hummus and try it and see how you like it with olive oil it was amazing I wish you could come over and eat with me those would be so much fun it's delicious it's really delicious and as I mentioned it's quick it's easy and it's a wonderful wonderful appetizer or side dish that will please all your guests so thank you for joining me today and I hope to see you again in the future I'm eating with her life take care Bon Appetit
