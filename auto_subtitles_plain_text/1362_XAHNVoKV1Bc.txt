 I believe in taking risks in life that's why I'm wearing white to make spaghetti and meatballs now you could spend all day making sauce or you could do it my quick and easy way and make the sauce and the spaghetti and the meatballs all in 35 minutes and here's how we're gonna start by preparing some soft fresh breadcrumbs for the meatballs so I have two slices of my homemade whole-wheat bread which is soft you can use white bread or a soft whole way but it has to be soft like this okay so we're gonna put that in the food processor and we're gonna cross what they call fresh breadcrumbs do not use dried bread compasses it has to be fresh breadcrumbs so we'll process it for about 10 seconds and that's how you make fresh breadcrumbs so it's about three quarters of a cup of crumbs and two slices like that will do it so we put those crumbs into a bowl okay with this batter and to the breadcrumbs we're gonna add 1/3 cup of milk now I'm using 1% milk you can use whole milk if you want but I just use it to keep the calories down so I'm gonna stir it up just a little bit with a four kind of get it all in there and while that absorbs this milk while the bread absorbs the milk we're gonna go on and make the sauce okay now what I do is I like to have a smooth sauce I'm going to use the same food processor if you don't have a food processor you can cut the bread into tiny little pieces and do the same thing and you can puree the tomatoes in a blender but I'm going to use the same food processor I'm using a twenty eight twenty eight ounce can of plum tomatoes they make the best tasting sauce I like it kind of smooth so I'm going to puree the tomatoes first all right that's been maybe 20 seconds and I think that's good to go okay alright so I started my burner going now let me just tell you about the or my popcorn let me tell you about the pot you do need a pot that's at least seven inches across the bottom so measure the bottom of your pot it has to be seven inches across because you have to fit all the meatballs in there in one layer so all right so now we're gonna make the sauce while the bread crumbs soak and we're going to saute clove of garlic which I have in here see that I already suppressed it in a tablespoon of olive oils so I'm going to put the olive oil in here all approximate just sauce you know but a tablespoon but the reason that you want to use a generous amount of oil is because the oil helps the lycopene and the tomatoes absorb better into your system it's a good cancer protector okay see the garlic is kind of gold now that's the perfect time to add the tomato so there it's it's been about maybe one full minute now we're going to add the tomatoes okay alright so that's it tomatoes are in now we're gonna add a few more ingredients and let this cook here's what we're gonna add we're adding 1/2 here's it's right here it's 1/2 teaspoon of Italian spice like a combination of Italian seasonings 1/2 teaspoon 2 teaspoons of sugar 1/4 teaspoon of salt they're gonna go in here ok and some fresh pepper to taste and well you got to do the fresh pepper okay alright well stir that up it's still bubbling so we're just gonna let it cook away here and we're gonna add some fresh basil but we're not gonna do it till the very last minute at all fantastic alright so we'll turn it down just a little let it simmer over here while we put together the meatballs okay now we have the the 3/4 of a cup of soft fresh breadcrumbs they've soaked in all that nice milk now we're going to add all of these ingredients here first of all it's an egg one egg gets added and then here's all the rest of the stuff very easy it's a tablespoon of fresh parsley a tablespoon of parmesan a tablespoon each it's 1/2 teaspoon of Italian spice the same one that went into the sauce a clove of garlic and a quarter teaspoon of salt ok and of course some fresh pepper to taste okay alright so that's all the flavoring for the meatballs we're going to you have to stir this before you add the meat okay because it's it's much better much better way to it incorporate all these flavors and everything - what's mixed in evenly so there that's it okay now we're going to add a 3/4 of a pound of ground beef and here it is right here that goes in okay simple now we're gonna make some meatballs now I'd like to use gloves but you know I forgot my gloves again I don't know how that happens every time I make a video I forget my gloves anybody anybody thank you thank you okay you can do this by hand I do it because I don't want to keep soaking my hands in water and drumming them out but just easier okay so now we're gonna combine all this sauce just bubbling nicely we're gonna combine all this you have to do it by hand and don't overdo it you just kind of fold underneath and like that and kind of squeeze it until you see it that's fairly well incorporated and I'm gonna show you my trick fourth this is this this recipe serves four people two meatballs each so we're going to be making eight meatballs okay here's my little trick you take the mixture once it's all mixed up like that it looks pretty good okay and in the bowl I kind of divide it in half like this okay and then I divide it in half again it's not perfect but it gives you a rough idea of how much you can use in each one so each one of these section is gonna make two meatballs okay so you just pick the meatballs and these are about two inches across and what I do is I put the meatballs on a plate or something and I want to dump them all in the sauce at the same time so there's one about a two inch two inches so you shape all the meatballs first and then we're going to drop them into the sauce and the Reid there's two reasons why these meatballs are so soft one is because we're using fresh breadcrumbs and not dried and the other is cuz they're gonna cook in the sauce and that just makes them taste better and makes them super super soft okay so let me finish up these eight meatballs in with the people put them in the sauce okay last meatball here it is didn't take very long now here's my eight meatballs as you can see they're not perfect but I consider meatballs like people they're not all perfect so but they're close enough in shape so now we're gonna drop them and give the sauce a little stir here and we drop them into the sauce and that's it okay now that's why you need that 7 inch saucepan to make sure that these get all underneath the sauce and then the sauce level is going to come up as the meatballs go in so there's 1 2 3 kind of gently 4 5 6 7 8 okay now if they're not completely covered you can just kind of tap them a little bit and now this cooks for 20 minutes and while those are that's it we're just going to add the basil at the end while that's cooking we make the spaghetti and we're done less than 35 minutes so the meatballs have been cooking now for about 10 minutes the water is boiling time to cook the spaghetti now the package says 2 ounces per person what if you're 5 3 ounces just for me all right the sauce is done look just look at this the meatballs are done the sauce is done it's nice and thick look at that here there's one more thing to do though and this is really important fresh basil you have to add at least 2 tablespoons of fresh basil you just kind of slice it into little strips or pieces it doesn't even matter but this smells amazing you just this is so key I think that's about 2 tablespoons fresh basil is key there's nothing like this smell but you have to do it last minute cuz you don't want to cook too much so we'll stir in the basil Oh smells amazing you got to come over ok sit you just throw that in fresh the spaghetti is done turn that off we're gonna drain the spaghetti all right I'll put it back in here and the best way I find is to stir a little sauce into the spaghetti first though it has red all through it just a little bit of sauce like that and tongs are a good way to kind of stir the sauce into it so it's all covered in red okay so there's my three ounce serving that's not that much come on okay now to serve it you got your spaghetti you put your two meatballs on top a little more sauce with that amazing basil look at that ah okay now of course if you like me there's still one more thing to do a little bit of fresh parmesan okay a little fresh parm oh my god the spaghetti and meatballs it's just the best thing in the world all right so now there is a proper way to eat spaghetti okay supposed to use a spoon and a fork and you go in and you kind of use the spoon and you twirl like that to get a nice little one bite right like that which is fine if you're dining with the royal family but then there's my way and my way is you take the fork and you just twirl and twirl and twirl and shove it in it's time saver awesome there are a lot of fancy ways to make garlic bread but I like to keep it simple a good look for bread lots of fresh garlic and a simple easy recipe and this one is really really easy Pizza is really about the crust isn't it especially pan pizza so how would you like to make the most amazing pan pizza and the easiest no rolling no kneading no work and you get this beautiful golden crispy crust
