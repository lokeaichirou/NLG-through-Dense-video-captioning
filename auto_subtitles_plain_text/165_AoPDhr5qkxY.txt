 vacation cooking you talk of Oz made simple this is what we need bell peppers onion mushroom beef olive oil spices salt and pepper from the wife salt and pepper and of course skewers two simple stages cut it up marinate it let it sit throw it on the barbecue kiss me dice up your mushrooms special note don't dice your onion into thin rings you want big chugs to cut your onion like this nice big onion chunk veggies marinating in here steak meridean here butter spices olive oil spices melting the butter for the steak salt pepper California garlic crushed red pepper if you like that spice we're going to let this marinate for about an hour olive oil pepper salt parsley minced onion crushed red pepper for spice we're using spices that just come included in this condo we're staying in flip it around the bowl not large enough for this mission wash your hands apply more these are good to go I'm going to put these marinate these along with the meat for an hour so we'll see you all right time to assemble our kabobs about the veggies we've got the beef we got the skewers we got everything we need now this would be considered the art form recognizing that your freedom and creativity is entirely 100% up to you do you want the mushroom to be next would you like a piece of beef to be next would you like a yellow pepper and a red pepper and not too Reds in the same order now we want a little bit of spacing for flame-broiled but we can stack it up we're going to fill out the rest like these and then we're going to throw them on the grill all right our kabobs are ready so let's get the grill fire it up and give these things barbecuing all right so our grill is he did not know this that some details medium to high heat on Grill make sure there's some space between each of the items so that the heat can fully cook the meat and the vegetables and you want to grill them for about 10 minutes turning as needed so that the meat is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender so I'm going to make sure everything's spaced out good on here kabob travel all right we're on slightly down from fully high heat grills heated up here we go about ten minutes from this going on alright I'm going to leave the lid open so that we can let some heat escape and just let the flame broil happen on the bottom and I brought a little bit of extra of the butter and spice that I had a meet so that I can just kind of give it a little vibe over here all right we just flipped them as you can see this piece right here cooking nicely and we're using we're getting a little bit of plant growth going on because of using some of the remaining marinade dripping it on there there we go Wow looking pretty good now you know we lost an onion here we can probably salvage it but as all things go there's no there's casualties in wars so I mean that's just life essential tool you know one is tongs it's nice and easy to get these up I'm checking in on on the how fully cook they are my wife likes it a little medium there's there's just slightly cook pretty much through leaving hers on a little bit longer but you know cook your meat to the temperature and amount of doneness that you would prefer there you have it simple and easy kabobs cooked to a few different doneness I cook these longer because my wife likes for me done this little bit of pink in the middle on this one because that's how I like it and I'm going to probably eat all three of these she'll have this one and so anyways just threw this together with some of the stuff we can find here at a condo on a vacation summer cooking with the candles kebabs and we vlog on this channel so subscribe for just kind of a few vlogs week and occasionally cooking videos talk soon alright well here's our final result action going on
