 how to make spicy buffalo chicken wings hello welcome to videojug my name is CJ and today I'll be making some spicy chicken wings so let's get started you will need the following ingredients to serve to people there will be a complete recap at the end step 1 marvelous marinade first I'm gonna make a marinade for my chicken wings essentially the marinade is gonna have buttermilk and some spices and then the buttermilk will kind of break down the chicken and make it really tender when it comes to Freitag the first thing I do is I take the buttermilk and I pour it in the bowl right here I have some chili powder you can go ahead and pour that in Cayenne there it is a lot of cayenne but they're gonna be spicy I put the Chi in the marinade also because you're gonna have hot sauce the enemy there'll be different sort of dimensions of the hot sauce this will be kind of a cooked heat and then only have the heat from the tangy buffalo sauce just a little stir here it should become pink in a second yes I was right all right now bring all the chicken wings and I like to salt the chicken wings right now instead of like putting a whole bunch of salt in the marinade because then I know how much I'm kind of like salting they'll get some salting after they come out of the fryer - but move these bad boys around get them some seasoning and then all I'm gonna do is just pour the marinade right on top there we go this marinades also important because it'll form like an adhesive for the flower to stick to it later so kind of massage this around in here this chicken wings okay these are all done and I'm gonna take them to the fridge step 2 flower power all right so I got my chicken here out of the refrigerator it's been marinating for a few hours in the buttermilk so hopefully that will make it nice and tender I'm gonna do here now is just Drudge it in some flour and then set over here we're gonna fry it and go from there you can pull put a whole bunch in here it's not that big a deal our hands are gonna get dirty regardless I'm getting a very dirty in a second here the buttermilk mixture there actually adds as kind of like an agent to keep some of this flour on here actually makes it kind of tacking somebody's little clumps of it here and there that'll crisp up nicely and add to the overall wing experience step 3 deep-fry now is this already here to go into the oil the oil is about 300 degrees I'm using canola oil so I gets the most healthy you could use beef fat or other things that a lot more flavor but in the pursuit of trying to be somewhat healthy here with these chicken wings we're going for this so here we go check and see how they're doing still a little tan let's get them back in there a little more love to get nice and golden brown as you can see doesn't take very long there's not a lot of not a lot of meat on these bad boys drumette done it boom lay it out on your kitchen towel here 27th bambam sitting probably more than six at a time the other thing is like when you do add things to all that are cold it's gonna bring the temperature oil down so it's gonna take a second be able to get back to the speed step for sauce and serve I've got all my wings now fried up and I'm gonna put them in this bowl here and I'm gonna add some buffalo wing sauce I'm using red hot right now I think it's the best let me go drizzle some of this on here give a little toss a toss okay now you just serve it up ball ready to go maybe some you know celery sticks in there and there it is chicken wings [Music]
