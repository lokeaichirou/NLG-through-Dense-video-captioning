 hello and welcome to Catan crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make these delicious pretzel dogs these are all beef franks filled and stuffed with melted cheddar cheese all wrapped up in a soft pretzel dough and baked to a golden brown perfection these are the ingredients that you'll need so let's get started now to start off of course I'm going to make up some pretzel dough here I have a separate video that shows how I do this and I go into more depth in that video but I'm just going to give you a basic rundown here I've already got some warm milk and sugar in a medium bowl here to that I'm going to add in some butter and I'm going to sprinkle some active dry yeast on top of that and I'm just gonna let that sit for a few moments to let the yeast kind of awake in and liven up a little bit I'm going to add in my salt and flour and just using my hand here I'm going to mix this together until it forms a dough and once that comes together and forms a dough I'm going to knead it for just a minute or two and then I'm going to lightly oil a bowl I'm going to cover this with a damp towel put it into a warm place to rise until it's about double in size again I'll go into more detail on that in a separate video and I will put a link to that video down below in the description box now while I'm waiting for my dough to rise I'm going to prepare my hotdogs these are all beef hot dogs you can use whatever kind of hot dogs that you want you can also use sausage for this if you wanted to but to make sure that the pretzel dough actually cooks on the inside you want to make sure that your hotdogs are nice and dry so I just got a paper towel here and I'm going to dry off my hotdogs and I'm just going to set them off onto a plate and then I'm going to take some cheddar cheese here this is just a chunk cheddar you can use whatever kind of cheese that you want to this happens to be sharp cheddar I'm just gonna cut these into thin slices and then cut the slices in half you just want a small thin strip or so of cheese to put inside of each hotdog and you don't have to stuff these with cheese if you don't want to you can just go ahead and leave them plain and then use a cheese sauce as a dipping sauce that's perfectly fine I just like to stuff mine because well I'm a cheese hecht but all you need to do to stuff these is to slice through your hotdog you don't want to cut all the way through you want to leave a little connected at the bottom so you know your hotdogs don't come apart and you have two halves but you just want to cut a little slit just deep enough that your cheese slice will fit in there just go ahead and gently put your cheese into the hotdog and then go ahead and set that off to the side now that we have the hotdogs done I'm going to go ahead and get my baking soda solution done I've got 1 cup of hot water here I'm going to add in one and a half tablespoons of just plain baking soda and you just want to go ahead and stir that until the baking soda is dissolved and then you want to place that into a wide and shallow dish I'm using a pie plate here for that now once your dough has doubled in size you go ahead and take it out of your bowl and you want to cut this into 8 equal pieces just cut it into fourths and then cut the fourth in half so you have 8 equal pieces and then go ahead and set all the pieces off inside we're only going to use one piece at a time here and to form your pretzel dogs you want to take 1 piece of dough here and you want to roll this out into a long rope this rope here that I'm using is about two two and a half feet long or so 24 13 inches or so it's actually quite long once you get that rolled out to a rope you want to use your fingertips and press this down flat that will make it easier to wrap around your hotdog and then you want to take your dog and starting at one end you want to place your dough and leave the end underneath the hotdog and the bottom part of the hotdog and you want to gently roll this dough around your hotdog make sure that the dough wraps or overlaps itself a little bit on each turn and you just want to keep rolling this until you get all the way to the other end and once you get to the end go ahead and stretch it a little bit so the other end sticks at the bottom of your hotdog so it looks like a little mummy here and once you get these all done now you can go ahead and dump them in your baking soda solution to make them officially a pretzel just take them one by one roll them in that solution and then place them back on to your baking sheet and then before these have a chance to dry I usually only do a couple at a time here you want to sprinkle these with some pretzel salt this is just a coarse grained salt you can find this in most grocery stores you could also use kosher salt if you really wanted to but pretzel salt is ideal pretzel salts really cheap so might as well use it a little goes a long way but it really does make a difference so just sprinkle a little bit of salt on the top of each one of these and then you want to bake these in a preheated 450 degree oven for between 9 and 11 minutes or so you want to keep an eye on them you want them to be nice and golden-brown and when they get to your desired doneness go ahead and take them out let them cool for just a minute and then I've got a couple tablespoons of butter here and I'm just going to use a pastry brush and I'm going to brush the tops and sides of my pretzel dogs with this melted butter this is going to make my pretzel dough or the pretzels wrapped around the dogs super soft it's going to labor these so amazing little butter makes everything more delicious and then you can go ahead and serve these up any way you so choose I like to be mine in ketchup if you want to do a beer cheese sauce you can do that or you can just eat them plain as they are and there you go that's how easy it is to make pretzel dogs at home I hope you guys give this recipe a try
