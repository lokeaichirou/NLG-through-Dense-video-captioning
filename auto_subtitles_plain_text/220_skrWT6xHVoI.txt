 today we're going to demonstrate oven-baked hashbrowns I love hashbrowns but unfortunately the oil is not as beneficial as if we could get the oil out and make it taste just as good and we're going to show you a way to do that we're going to start with a half a cup of raw cashews I'm going to put in 3/4 cup of water 1/2 a tablespoon of onion powder 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder be careful with that because too much is going to take over as a dominant flavor and then 2 tablespoons of chicken flavoring I've chosen Mackay's you can choose a different brand I like McKay's it has no MSG in it and the the type that I get and I'm just going to blend those until smooth and with a high speed blender it only takes a few seconds okay that's now smooth I'm going to add that to 8 cups of hashbrowns you can get frozen hashbrowns and this would speed up the process of making it you will need 2 pounds which is equivalent to 8 cups you just want to mix that mixture in with the hashbrowns we're then going to cover it with a cup of finely diced onions put it on our cookie sheet and then put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until the edges are getting quite brown you don't want to leave it in too long because the edges will start burning so that's pretty well mixed up we're going to add 1 cup of finely diced onions going to mix that in and then put it on a cookie sheet you can use a nonstick cookie sheet I put a very slight amount of olive oil on this cookie sheet just so that the hashbrowns won't stick to it and then we're going to put it in the oven so that's pretty well mixed up and we're going to just place that onto the cookie sheet you want to spread it fairly smooth uniform thickness don't compress it too much and then we'll put that in the oven for 20 minutes and you will be amazed that this tastes so much like hashbrowns that you've cooked in a skillet with all that oil so here we have our oven baked hash browns and there's not a bit of oil except a little bit of oil that was in the cashew nuts when you eat this you'll never go back to eating hashbrowns with oil you can notice that it's a little browned on the edge that's what you want it to look like that's tells you and it's done the potatoes are cooked nicely through and you can serve those up and your family will just love them enjoy you
