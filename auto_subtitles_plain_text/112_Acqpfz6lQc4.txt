 spring rolls can be filled with anything there is Spinoza with chashu the changed Rose port with shrimp with chicken vegetarian you can't find two recipes for singles that are the same so for today what I did was I made up a vegetarian spring roll so we have something that Aryan and especially a mushroom flavor and what's in it is shredded nap this is napa also I'll say this one wrong ginseng yeah bok choy has a thick white stock and then a broad dark green leaf Bob is white joy is vegetable so this is napa cabbage sometimes also called shantung okay it's a very very light taste very crispy it's very light and the tuesday a million things i'm stir-fried as a vegetable okay so i have shredded up some of that i shredded up some carrots i prepared some monkey these are shredded bamboo shoots the preferred bamboo is called the winter bamboo shoot it's a little more tender also they can but they're whole and they're awkward to deal with it will say on the can of course you will not say it will say they changed okay straight if you look carefully there also sell them swimsuit and you could use those but then you have to cut like this I use these a lot because they're ready to go drain them squeeze out the water I recommend you blanch in boiling water for a minute to get that sort of can taste out and then use a mini recipe they're kind of indestructible there's the crunchy texture yeah they're a little bit crunchy even everything can so here you can see the noodles it's a bunch of shreds and the key is there's no liquid it has to be dry if it's wet when you roll up the spring roll it's going to show you next it'll tear or rip it'll break so it needs to be quite dry and you trust if I go straight I do it by a drum and you want to say stir-fry I have a 200,000 BTU outside and burn this row living in the house I have a stove like this and you can do it fine you can do find in the frying pan in this you can even do it in the non-stick pan these as long as it says spring roll shelves from roll wrapper sometimes they'll say lumpy ax which i think is an Indonesian I think Filipino okay not too far off the right I didn't say Texas and here's the thing they come in the talk it's about 25 in a package and they are like all stuck together okay they come frozen and you get them home quickly you leave me in the freezer but I would rewrap them even the hold onto him and sometimes they're very hard to separate I mean it's easy to find the edge and sometimes you'll pull them apart these are fine and they won't come apart easily like this and the trick is actually to go sort of to the middle and pull them into two and then keep dividing if you're having a problem with them sticking because they just sometimes they really stick now making spring rolls is really is rocket science and so it's really hard and none of you will ever be able to I can do this so you take the spring roll wrapper and you can also get these smaller you can cut them and make them smaller okay you lay it down you don't have to let this really seem to work the best okay you take where's my other you take some filling I like to take about not that much if you put more filling you'll get a thicker roll I'm not a big deal so you can see the mushrooms and the noodles and so forth and then you bring this corner up put it past and just pull it back a little bit kinda like rolling a cigarette so you're pulling a little to get it a little tighter okay come over bring up the sides and actually when you do this the trick is kind of don't pull this hard over okay it's right back and you want to make sure that it isn't going out at this angle see this one is going straight or slightly in if it's out when you roll it up it'll be all wrong so you just bring it over it doesn't have to be super neat you'll see why okay and you roll it up pretty sort of tightening it as you go you roll here and you bring your hand out as you roll a little bit not super tight but pretty fun I need to take some glue in this case it's glue in this case the scrambled egg if you are a vegan you could use a little library case flour and water you just need to really seal the end and you roll it up and that's it these are hard to make yeah and they're very delicate and you have to be extremely careful with these to show you okay puts them in that's not the same amount so it'll be slightly different if you really want to get them all the same size you put something down on your board that's the length you want let's say it is I wanted to make them all the size I would put this down and then I would really that's all I don't have enough filling I'd unroll it I put a little work and what you do in a while you get used to making them pretty uniform thank you fold it over you fold it over put a little glue using a pastry brush that's it then and these you could freeze right yeah roll out that reason they'd be great recipes make sure you wrap the very airtight that was just a bad way now okay that's a lot in there but I'd give it just a bit and then you fry them until they're just right and that's it so it sort of can't hurt really I mean well I was very cold they would get soggy and then we would just take him out get the oil hot drop them in and the oil would come out of them I don't mean oil that got inside but oil in the dough yeah if you raise the temperature it will you know give it up so when you put them in I don't really put a few too many I will tell you I don't know the answers when you have spring rolls in my personal opinion is the best thing in the world that you can put on them the best thing I've ever had I tried plum sauce which is very gingery and sticky a little metal porfavor is there anything in this world that my ploy yeah I grew up eating that but I said this is it this is a Thai product I keep saying China Chinese and now I'm not asleep very sweet Wow
