 hello my dear chefs and welcome I forgot what I was seeing hello my dear chefs and welcome to the kitchen of spice it up today I'm very excited to share with you ha it's a traditional recipe that was invented in Naples which is a beautiful city you definitely need to go and check it out if you ever come to Italy amita Pizza I'm going to show you the most traditional of them all which is the basic watermark any time which is just a plain red beet so if someone says I love cheese and then you can just jazz it up according to whatever you'd like just put it on top of it it will be amazing and it's all about the ingredients good fresh drop ingredients trick for an Italian plates to be honest and I think I just rambled and raved before I don't know like 30 minutes or something so let's stop the chatting and let's go straight into the recipe you're gonna need some all-purpose flour natural rising yeast for bread and pizza granulated white sugar because this won't activate your yeast water which has to be at least at room temperature just a pinch of salt and good quality extra virgin olive oil for the dressing you're gonna need good quality tomato sauce I made a video explaining you all about how to do it and you're gonna need some fresh basil some dried oregano and some good-quality mozzarella cheese and some extra virgin olive oil the first thing you wanna do is activate your East so I'm taking my niece my room temperature water and much sugar I'm just gonna add my water to the sugar because the sugar activates the East it's basically the East then you do the water and the sugar you're gonna add your yeast just gently stir it so that any lumps are disintegrated and set it aside for 5 to 6 minutes you'll see that the yeast has been activated because it will start to form a nice nice bubbly foam on top my says activated it's nice unfolding on top and I'm gonna take my flower I'm gonna just make a well at the center and I'm going to pour in my yeast water mixture then I'm gonna gently incorporate it with a fork to the flour mixture you sprinkle it about a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil I'm gonna sprinkle in a pinch of salt I'm just gonna lightly flour my hands don't add too much flour because otherwise it won't become too thick just enough so that nothing sticks to your hands you're gonna need this thing together until it's nice and start eating it together the thing is that with bread mixtures the mole is the more you need things together the more soft and fluffy the end result as you can see my pizza dough is nice and ready it's fluffy now you just wanna move it into a bowl and it's super easy you gonna take the side pitch them together switch them together one lap perfect full now you're gonna take your pizza ball go and put into a slightly oiled Bowl just rather than ground but in my pizza dough because oil blocks the oxidation so them no problem before the top of it I'm gonna cover it with kitchen towel and place this in a warm place to rise for about one hour or until it has doubled in size I'm gonna show you the results when you get there my pizza dough has been resting for the last hour and a half and it has doubled in size and it's nice and fluffy it looks perfect and now we're just ready to spin it out and shape it into a circular shape put the toppings on and eat everything up I'm gonna cover my dough in flour so that it's not sticky and now to shape it it's really really easy and you're just with your finger do an indent you do a circular shape and with your fingers you just not and you start shaping your outside part of the pizza and then what I like to do is with 1/2 I just start flipping it up on the side keeping one hand and you can see it just stretches if you don't like to do this by hand you can just roll it out you wanna just roll it out evenly not do thinly until it has approximately after conference of 30 centimeters and you're done now you want to cut out your mozzarella I like to cut mine in thin slices just leave it a minute to pour out the water and squeeze the water out otherwise when you put it in the oven it will become too watery now you want to take your tomato sauce and just season it I just like pinch of salt and adding some oregano because to me tomato sauce and oregano is just pizza and now it's super easy you're just gonna take a spoon of your tomato sauce place it in the middle of your pizza and just spoon it round I'm gonna top my pizza with mozzarella you go a couple of leaves of fresh basil a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil and now this you need to put on your baking sheet if you have the traditional oven like I do I just use a nice preheated pizza stone and it works perfectly if you don't have a pizza stone just use aluminium foil not the shiny part the other way around just put a drizzle of bit of extra-virgin olive oil so that nothing sticks you can add your pizza to it and pop it into a preheated 250 degrees celcius oven for at least 12 to 15 release until it gets a nice brown delicious color and I'm gonna show you the results whenever and here you have it your delicious homemade margherita pizza for the final style I can't wait to try this I cut myself a slice because I don't know about you guys but we in Italy we did with our hands pizza for me it's like the most amazing comfort food ever it's just delicious as you can see my pizza is quite thin but has a thicker crust on the outside it has a beautiful golden color and this is what we call napoletana style some of them do it thicker than this but this is just how I like my pizza oh good so when I stop talking right now because pizza definitely needs to be eaten hot and this is cooling down and I really wanna eat this so I hope you enjoyed spending time with me I hope
