 welcome again to bake your way kitchen on today's video I'm going to show you how to make a tomato soup a nice fresh tomato soup great for the summer great quite frankly all year round it's just a great great delicious recipe and it's so easy to make so I'm just going to show you what you need to get started so what I've got here is a large saucepan and I've got about three to two to three tablespoons of oil and they're going to preheat the oil and put the onions in a bit but before I get to that let's get to the tomatoes yes for this soup we are using fresh tomatoes so you'll probably need about two pounds worth and I've got a mixture of things here so I've got regular Tomatoes I think I've got two or three here and then I've got about 200 grams of cherry tomatoes and basically I put a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of vinegar and it really brings out that tomato flavor you'll need to pre-heat your oven to about 400 degrees and then and then take and then cut your Tomatoes accordingly if they're cherry tomatoes obviously you don't need to cut them and they're going to go into the oven which I will do right now for about I would say probably about 20 minutes so I'm going to put this in sorry so to make sure that goes in properly all right so now in the meantime I've got my oil here as I mentioned I'm going to go over to the stove preheat the oil then add in the onions and let them saute till the till they start to sweat out a bit and I'll show you the next step the onions they've caramelize they've really sweated out you can see usually once they're really glassy that's a really good indicator so now what we're going to do is add in our garlic you want to put it near the end of the major like when you're cooking over high heat your your onions because you don't want the garlic garlic has a tendency so you really want to make avoid that so you want to get this a mix for 20 30 seconds just so that barrel it kind of get some used a little bit so now we're going to be adding in a few additional ingredients and I will show you that right now the first thing I'm going to add is about one and a half cups of stock now you could use chicken stock I'm using vegetable stock to keep this vegetarian I'm also going to add in some peeled tomatoes this is a 28 fluid ounce 796 milliliters can so you want to get this in this wouldn't fully open some kind of doing this on its side so you want to give this a little bit of a mix we want to give this a little bit of salt and pepper and if your roasted tomatoes are out of the oven if it's been 20 minutes 25 minutes then just leave them on the side we'll use them in a bit on a little bit more salt I don't lie a lot there we go so we're going to give this a quick mix and one thing I'm going to do I always do with the canned tomatoes I'm just gonna I always take a little bit of water to get out all those tomato juices they're perfectly good there we go so now we're going to let this come up to a boil once it's come up to a boil I'm going to reduce the heat and cover it for about ten or fifteen minutes and this will allow some of the excess of liquid to evaporate and at that point we will put in the roasted tomatoes but I'll show you first what that looks like when it comes to the boil and then when and then after it's been covered so I'll be back in just a second it's come to a boil so now what we're going to do is reduce the heat and I'm also going to add in some fresh basil leaves if you don't have fresh basil leaves first of all you can use sweet Italian red whatever it is you want I'm using about a third of a cup you use more or less I actually a growing basil outside in the garden and so it smells phenomenal I'm telling you if you can get your hands on fresh basil it really will take this soup from here to way up here and one of the great things about this tomato soup that we're making it's quite it's perfect for even like a sauce for like spaghetti or something so I'm going to have a baked pasta video coming up and you can easily use this recipe as a substitute anyway I'm just going to cover this now and it's on medium so we're going to let this simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes and you'll notice that will thicken up a bit and I'll show you the next step alright as you can see I'll try to show you our tomatoes have been simmering for quite a while there's been some liquid that's evaporated but it's there's still going to be some now my tomatoes are ready I've got my tomatoes here and I'm just going to add them in whoops there we go so now what we're going to do is we're going to quickly get the salt mix together first of all we are going to continue over medium heat if it's on low you can bring it up to medium and we're going to let this cook you can either do it covered or uncovered if you feel like it's very runny you can cover it if you prefer for about five or ten minutes just so that it comes up to a bit of a simmer and then we are going to go ahead and use the immersion blender now just before we get there I just want to be careful if you're using an immersion blender be very careful make sure you have high sides because if you're not careful it could splatter everywhere and the absolute worst thing in the world is when tomatoes splatter all over your kitchen it's a mess and it's it's such a disaster so try to avoid that so I'm going to go off camera but I'll be back when we blend it all together so I've left that cook for a little while I covered it and it's looking great it's thickened up a bit it's got an amazing tomato smell now here's the thing normally actually there's a few options normally you can you can either just blend this as is or you could go and Nick pick out the basil leaves I personally don't mind the basil leaves left in it's up to you you can take them out if you want I'm going to leave mine in so this is the part we need to be very careful about and I am just praying to God that this doesn't go everywhere so basically you take your immersion blender if you don't have an immersion blender you can use a food processor and we're going to slowly go like this just around and as you do more you can mix it longer but just for the beginning be careful and you just want to keep mixing around it'll take a few minutes so I'll show you what it looks like once it's done pureed through now if you really want a nice smooth cream of tomato soup or tomato soup you can put it through a sieve and I don't usually do that because I don't mind if it's a little grainy but some people are very sensitive with the seeds and if that's you that's absolutely fine you can just take the extra time to strain it to make sure you get all that out don't want it but the final step I've preheated the stuff a little bit I'm adding in about a tablespoon or so of parmesan you could add a little more a little less when you want now you could add about you could add a little bit of whipping cream but what I'm going to do is add a couple tablespoons butter and a little dash of milk and this will make it a little bit creamy we go there we go now once you've mixed this in we are going to adjust it for seasoning so I'm going to take a taste all right let's see how it's like oh it's hot mmm that is very good that is very good it's got its so it's got this nice tomato flavor and I'm telling you using real Tomatoes using good canned tomatoes using very good ingredients will make a huge difference I am they'll going to add a little bit more salt and I'm probably going to add a little bit more pepper and I think that's going to be perfect so what do you do now well it's up to you you can serve it as is or you can serve it with some crunchy bread or with croutons you can make this with a pasta dish it's really up to you I hope you enjoyed this recipe thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
