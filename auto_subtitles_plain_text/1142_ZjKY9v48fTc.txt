 I love potatoes especially mashed potatoes and when st. Patrick's Day rolls around I think mashed potatoes and cabbage they're great together and I'm going to show you how easy it is to prepare red potato colcannon so first of all I've already started to saute about 1/2 cup of sliced onions and I sliced them thin and once they're nice and translucent I'm going to add some really thinly sliced cabbage I have about 6 cups of cabbage I just sliced it really thin with my chef's knife and I cut the cabbage in half it took about half of a medium sized cabbage and I cut it in half first and then I cut it in quarters took the core out and sliced two of those quarters nice and thin for this dish and now I'm just going to saute it in the pot with the onions until it starts to get a little bit Brown so it'll take a few minutes so it took about five minutes for the cabbage to get a little bit Brown and now I'm going to add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of milk you can use dairy or non-dairy milk for this and once I add the milk I'm just going to cover the pot just for a couple minutes so that the cabbage just cooks a little bit more there we go now while that was cooking I steamed my potatoes I have one pound of small potatoes I didn't peel them they're red skin potatoes and I cut them into quarters and I steamed them until they're just tender so I can poke my fork in nice and easy but they're not gonna smush up that's exactly how they like them now I'm going to take my tender steamed potatoes add them to the pot and then all I'm going to do is mash it up a little bit you can use your hand potato masher or you can use a big fork and just mash up the potatoes now this is not smooth creamy mashed potatoes this is a lot more rustic so you'll have just nice pieces of potato with the red skin showing the browned cabbage mmm it's delicious and it goes perfect with your corned beef if that's what you'd like to have for st. Patrick's Day there that looks perfect now I'm just going to stir it up I'll add a little bit of salt and pepper give it a little taste mmm it's perfect now you're all set for st. Patrick's Day I'm pseudo Dean sharing good food for good life 365
