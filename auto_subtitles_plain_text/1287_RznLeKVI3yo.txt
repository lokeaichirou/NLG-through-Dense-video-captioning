 having a healthy nourishing diet is about more than just counting numbers and calories in your food it's very much about enjoying the eating experience and there's not much I enjoy more than eating wings I'm Super Bowl Sunday I'm Danny's fees and for this quick bite I'm showing you how to make my clean and delicious baked buffalo wings now the first thing I did was set up a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with aluminum foil and then topping it with a wire wrap the aluminum foil just makes for easy cleanup and the wire rack allows the heat to circulate around the wings while they're cooking so that they don't get soggy then to prepare the wings I gave them a good rinse under some cold water then I patted them nice and dry with some paper towels and then using a nice sharp knife I separated the wing and the drum net right at the joint where they attached since we're baking our wings instead of frying them I like to make sure that I infuse lots of flavors into the wings themselves and here's how I do that I start by adding in a tablespoon each of garlic powder chili powder paprika great color there a half a teaspoon of kosher salt and a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper now you could add more or less cayenne pepper depending on how spicy you like your wings and then a quarter cup of your favorite buffalo wing sauce right over the top then you just got to get your hands in there and mix it really well you just want to be sure that all those wings are coated with the sauce and spices now you could marinate these anywhere from 30 minutes up to several hours but since my babysitter is gonna be back very soon with my kids I need to wash my hands and get these in the oven and just remember whenever the raw chicken touches you really want to make sure you give it a really good wash hands sink cutting board scrub it all down now I've got my oven preheating at 400 degrees and I'm just gonna get my wings onto the sheet that I set up earlier now you can get them on the rack here nice and close and cozy but you do want to avoid having them actually touch because then they may start to get soggy nobody wants a soggy wait so now we're gonna put these in the others for 20 minutes then I'm gonna take them out give them all a flip and then pop them back in and finish it off for another 20 at the end of the day eating well it's really all about balance and that doesn't mean that we need to balance every single meal that we eat for instance Super Bowl Sunday I have full intention of enjoying some wings and a nice cold beer and all that means is come Monday I'm gonna have plenty of water and make sure that I have extra veggies see the goal here is not to be crazy it's to eat well feel good and have some fun our wings are done put a poem out mmm and as you can see they are nice and golden-brown and they smell amazing now you're gonna notice that baked wings don't get quite as crispy as fried wings but I promise you these guys are packed with flavor once the wings are cool enough to handle you're just gonna get them into a nice big bowl and toss them with another half cup of buffalo sauce now I like the six of the classics and serve my wings up with carrot and celery sticks and of course a little bit of blue cheese dressing for more simple and nutritious recipes tips and ideas make sure you check out clean and delicious calm I'm Danny's peas and I'll see you next time with another quick bite hmm that delicious full flavor spicy juicy dead-on
