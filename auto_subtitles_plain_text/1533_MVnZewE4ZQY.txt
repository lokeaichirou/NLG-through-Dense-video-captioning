 royal enfield show today I'm in the kitchen making sauerkraut sauerkraut is a wonderful way to eat fermented vegetables you also like to eat kimchi i think i made a video about that before and today I'm going to mix our crap using the food processor and we're going to be actually using the shredding blade so I took out the S blade I'm going to put this measuring flip and then printing plate in here and what I'm going to do first I have one red cabbage and I'm going to remove the outer leaves we remove those and i'm going to remove the stem just kind of slice this up into small pieces so that we can put it into the food processor I'm going to take out part of the center and just slice it into pieces that will fit down in there and it's really simple to shred it when you have a food processor okay so I cut this into small pieces and I'm just going to start dropping it into the food processor so once you've done the shredding you just need to take off take this out and we are actually going to be using this croc right here that our friends Michael and Ellen from foods alive got for us they blessed us with this so this is such a beautiful crop so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to layer some of the sauerkraut into the crock okay and so you do one layer at a time and then you sprinkle some sea salt on top and then you're just going to push down you can use them a masher but i'm just going to use my fists and you just kind of push down and it will release some of the juices from the cabbage and that will help the fermentation process so I'm just putting this in here and you can tell that when you need the liquid to cover the cabbage completely and for some reason you don't have enough of the liquid you can add some water with sea salt to pour it on top or pause so suggest that you could use some of the cabbage for the cabbage juice so you can do that so you just do it like you know layers at a time it doesn't matter how cool this is if you don't want it to polls ok so once you finish layering the sauerkraut this pot actually comes with some of these waiting stones so you can place this on top kind of press down there you go and then what we're going to do now is we're going to put the lid on to see that we're going to add a little water so and then we're going to wait about three to four days and then once we start hearing the sauerkraut bubbling and that means the fermentation process has begun so then we can set this aside for about four to six weeks that's how long it's going to take and then we will have some fresh sauerkraut so maybe when we get the finished product we can do a video update with that so it's really simple to add some fermented vegetables to your diet and so nutritious it helps put the probiotics and enzymes it's great to have a serving of a fermented vegetable with all of your meals so hopefully you can get started and make some sauerkraut thanks everyone during the raw light health show have a great day and a great bra line which is well good for you this is the wrong I can show my life writing of your life
