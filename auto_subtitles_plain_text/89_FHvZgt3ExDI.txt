 hey guys Jason Hill here today and I'm with chef Greg Stillman at rapport restaurant in Rancho Cucamonga and he's going to make up a discourse today what are we going to have we are going to have a traditional margarita pizza as done in Naples Italy and we're going to bake it right here in our 800 degree oven so this is this is the dough it ferments overnight darts off has an 8 ounce ball and you can tell it's very loose and texture and that is because the the gluten has had a long time to relax in the refrigerator overnight and develop the nice bubbles that we're going to see on the edge of the crust and then the tomatoes are a Spanish canned tomato very similar to a san marzano but not quite as sweet I like it to have a little bit more acid than the San Marzano and then we have a handmade mozzarella cheese that's made in Los Angeles they make it daily and then fresh basil and then extra-virgin olive oil okay so we've replaced the dough directly into the Caputo flour that we import from Italy it's the same flour that we make the dough with and then we give it a flip as I've read in some some manuals of for Italian pizza that are Neapolitan and style they say this is something you have to do in order for it to be traditional you have to actually dip it in the flour although I'm not quite sure but that's what we do anyway we sprinkle the surface and then real quick we just give a squish with our palm and make it flat in the center not really disturbing the outside edge and then with our fingertips we read imple the rest of the pizza moving the pizza around definitely made definitely handmade not trying your best not to disturb the edge because that's where you're going to get a lot of natural bubbles from the fermentation once you've dimpled you're going to do a quick stretch with while you're rotating your you're stretching the just the edge of the dough out and you're trying your best not to disturb the center the center generally stretches out on its own you won't have to worry too much about it really just stretching the edge and you can see with not too much fanfare we've established a good diameter without too much pullback you actually see almost none then we're going to put it pick it up and put it on the backs of our hands and just let it kind of hang down on the backs of our knuckles and then the diameter is is even greater and we've really not worked too hard to get it that way and what are ingredients in the dough's the dough is strictly Caputo flour it's the red bag if you want to look for it on Amazon and it has a particular content of ash and gluten and protein that we prefer and it is a double-0 ground flour and salt water and instant yeast not active dry but instant okay and we'll give you the recipe for that later so after you stretch it this is basically the size you don't have to throw it or anything just put it right onto our pizza peel there we're going to use to get into our oven and then we're going to put some sauce on it this is our Antonina tomatoes and the only thing that we do to this canned tomato is put a little bit of salt in it and elevate the salt level and that's it we puree it with salt and that is it's about two two and a quarter to two and a half ounces of sauce and I'm going to put the cheese on next and probably you guys will wonder why there's not that much cheese on there and if you've ever been Italy you'll know that they just don't put a lot of cheese on there Neapolitan style pizzas got this recipe from restaurants that I've worked in I'm not sure if you've been to Downtown Disney but oh yeah there's there's a kids yeah there's a place called Naples and they crank out about 500 to 600 pizzas a day and then yeah I used to run that place so it's just a haphazard scattering that's it that's the only amount of cheese we're going to put on there and the cheese is going to melt down real fast in the oven and kind of spread out just a little bit but not much it's not an american-style pizza where the whole thing is covered with cheese you taste more of the acid of the tomato and the extra virgin olive oil actors come out of the oven the last thing we put on here is a little bit of basil fresh basil and we can put these whole are you breaking up III break them up you can leave in the hole it doesn't really matter the surprisingly they just get a little bit charred but not much sometimes they even retain all their green color after they come out of the oven so that's all we do to the pizza and then we go into the oven just going to place it directly on the stone and give it a shake and off it goes generally it's going to stay in there about two minutes and the higher the temperature of the oven the faster it will bake obviously and you'll start to see immediately the the crust will start to give rise and the cheese will start to kind of sweat a little bit the sauce will start to boil and you'll get some characteristic charring on the backside of the pizza that's closest to the fire and so we'll have to rotate it every 30 to 45 seconds your your home oven will take you about 10 minutes at the very bottom that's where you want to have your pizza stone so it's directly in contact with with your heating element of your stove now the wood you have back there it's not anything for smoking flavor or anything like that it's just a neutral if you want a very neutral and clean burning wood so this is white oak white oak yeah so you can see that one bubbling up nice the cheese you can see it's a little bit more resistant than the dill and you're looking to pull it a little just starting to caramelize the top of the cheese getting a little bit Brown that's when I like it to be done and that is a good pizza we're going to put a little bit of extra virgin olive oil directly on yeah over the whole pizza and then in America we cut it but I'm told in in Italy you cut it yourself and here is how we serve a traditional Neapolitan pizza from repor restaurant in rancho cucamonga hmm all that sauce is amazing it's all about the sauce yeah fresh mozzarella mozzarella a little bit of basil simple but elegant you gotta come try this you
