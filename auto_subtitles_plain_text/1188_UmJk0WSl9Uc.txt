 they're just a few great things everybody should have in life they should have great dreams one should have great failures and one should absolutely have great recipes if there is ever a recipe you should have in your repertoire it is today's super decadent and super cheesy macaroni he5 start off making a classic white sauce and giving it a few insurance policies to make sure all goes well I had tons of cheese I played with the sauce and when the sauce is thick and luscious I mix in a little sour cream it adds a great Tang and keeps everything nice and creamy trust me when I say this this is the only mac and cheese recipe you will ever need and of course everything we do you don't got to be simple delicious easy and Jessica food so let's get started with really I mean I got to tell you this is like the ultimate ultimate mac and cheese recipe one try this and I'm telling you you are all set to go when it comes to macaroni and cheese all right so I got a couple of cheese's here and I like to use and really any combination amount of cheese will work so I'm using a nice white cheddar I'm using a sharp cheddar I'm using a little bit of fontina a little bit of Gouda and I'm going to finish off with some of that process sort of American cheese products please don't front anything okay I know what you're saying but I got to tell you what that does for the cream factor in mac and cheese I think is absolutely fantastic so I'm just getting my cheese is all prepped up here I'm going to go ahead and chop it in our food processor and get all the cheese grated and get it ready to go from Agra cheese so there's a cheese that we gotta grate it up super simple to do I mean the food processor is totally the way they go plus what happens is that sometimes you know you get to cheese when you're behind in bulk it's a lot cheaper because I don't know about you but cheap is a little pricey you know it's a little expensive but this is great so put it in a food processor if you're slightly chilled it's going to go ahead and cook up and crane up just a little bit better but totally the way that work and listen try any combination of cheese you might I'm going to this combination just because I love the way the flavors mix together the cheddar cheeses and the fontina and the Gouda I think it's just fantastic so this is great and what we're going to do to make sure it's super creamy is we're going to add in some delicious sour cream when you use a light sour cream and I got to tell you the reason I'm going to use the sour cream is because I remember I'm a grandmother's boy you know and I remember when my grandmother was sick it was doing her last time some of her last times here with us she um you know she was how at home and she was sort of bedridden and her sister my mana Trina she would come over every day and she would cook my grandmother whatever she wanted to have for dinner and I was just watched in amazement as this woman would come in the house and effortlessly just sort of lip up these fantastic these meals and I gotta tell you it was so good eating and I remember watching her one time make macaroni cheese she put sour cream in the mac and cheese and I said my god what is that but when you taste it you don't really taste sour cream yeah it gives it a little bit of that Tang that happens with sour cream a little zippy stuff that happens but I got to tell you what this does for the cream factor and that mac and cheese is it's beyond phenomenal so that's what we're going to do that I'm going to put a little bit of Omaha SH to my Trina and that time period and I'm going to do a little sour cream and it takes me back to some really really fond memories that's what cooking is about you know it's like hey do what works for you go back to you know memory lane go back to those time periods where you no fool takes you to that place because that's what food does right all right cool so our cheese art is all cut up that was this processed American cheese product you know what it's called not gonna say it cuz they ain't paying me to say it you owe to me but you know what it is I love what that does for the mac and cheese as well all right begin my head's a quick wash and get started on our cream sauce all right so that cheese sauce is done and looks amazing look at this okay hello like this is fantastic it smells great this is exactly what we want to go for all right the last thing is really something just going to go ahead and add in some sour cream to this because that's the way my aunt Trina did it and that's the way I'm going to do it all right it's gonna help with the creamy factor help every day you set up nicely I wish you could smell this all right trust me when I tell you this is the only macaroni and cheese recipe you're probably ever going to need your entire life all right I've got some elbow macaroni pasta that I'm gonna have boiled off in some super salty water I'm just going to put it in right it's been drained and cooled and it's ready to go so I'm just going to drop it in just like that right and then to this I'm now going to go ahead and add in this luscious cheese sauce all right are you ready for this because I oh here we go cheese sauce goes on just like that mmm just take a moment and just take that in oh yeah smells great looks great it's going to taste fantastic hmm all right the rest I'm going to be there later I just want to give it a nice stir just to make sure everything is really well incorporated or this is it you know and this even reminds me of like growing up Thanksgiving my mom would be a grandmother would be up making the macaroni cheese this reminds me of the way that look and the way is smell right so just to finish it off I'm just going to do some cheese right on top I saved some of our cheese blended from earlier because I want to put a little bit right on top and I want to get this off into the oven the ovens preheated at 400 degrees now this
