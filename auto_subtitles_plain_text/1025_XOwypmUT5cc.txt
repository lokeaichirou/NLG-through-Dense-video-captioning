 okay so today we're going to make generals chicken now I don't care how you say it general toes so however just I just call it generals chicken it's a not a traditional Chinese dish there's no doubt about that yeah you start researching the history it's very cloudy of where it came from but it's definitely not Chinese in the sense it did not come from mainland China there's a lot of saying thinking that it came from the US there's also some claims that it came from Taiwan but it's a very popular Chinese dish Chinese / whatever you want to call it dish and I happen to like it it's one of them even knowing that it's not real Chinese I still love it occasionally watery but it's hard to find a place that does it right oh there's most of the buffet places it really has no flavor it just tastes sweet and there's really there's nothing to it it's not done the way that it should be done so anyway I'm going to do it the way that I like to do it as you can see I've got some chicken breasts that I've cut up I prefer to use thigh but breast does taste really good done this way now I've got some sesame seeds that I've lightly bruised up that half a tablespoon oh by the way all the ingredients and the amounts are going to be listed under more info so if you look under the box that you're watching the video in and you're going to see some information you'll see a little thing that says more info you click that and it will open up a new box and it will show you all the ingredients in the amounts so we're going to give this a mix just kind of get it on the chicken kind of spread it out a little bit now this is going to be a deep-fried dish not us not a stir-fried dish kind of thinking about maybe some day trying to stir-fry to just see how it turns out kind of curious about that I'm going to take a teaspoon of a Chinese cooking wine maybe a little more if you don't want to use alcohol you shoot some water or chicken stock or something like that it will taste slightly different but chances are most people will not notice a lot of people don't want to use alcohol either they're feeding it to the kids or they may have allergies or whatever anyway one teaspoon of soy sauce I've got a pinch of us you mix this up we've got to kind of layer these things in say in a sauce got to get certain I'm putting certain ingredients on in certain orders there we go I've got a pinch of salt and a pinch of white pepper if you want an amount that's maybe eighth of a teaspoon of each we're going to give this a mix heavier I have two teaspoons of cornstarch we're going to give this a mix until we do not see any more white specks and then we'll let this marinate for 15 minutes to half an hour or something like that while we make our sauce and we do some other preparation work okay so let's make our sauce I have a quarter cup of chicken stock I have one tablespoon of dark soy sauce now if you don't have the dark it's okay you can use just all regular because now I'm going to put in one tablespoon of regular soy sauce so if you don't have the dark just use two tablespoons of that I have half a tablespoon of the Chinese cooking wine I have a half a tablespoon of hoisin sauce now I've started using this couch on hoisin sauce I really like it it seems to be less chemically flavored than the others anyway I've got one teaspoon of black vinegar 1 teaspoon of sugar one teaspoon of sesame oil then I want to give us a good start and set it to the side yeah this is a few ingredients in here but we can make everything ahead of time and then it all comes together don't worry ok few ingredients to talk about I've got some dried red chili peppers here I'm using 3 these are pretty spicy you can use pretty much anything you want you can leave them out completely but it should have a little bit of that I have about 2 teaspoons of chopped ginger it's a coarsely chopped for garnish I've got some sliced up green onion and some sesame seeds I've got some flour for dipping I'm using about a third of a cup exactly how much it's not really that important but a third of the cup is a good starting point you can maybe can get by with a quarter cup you may need a half a cup you don't want to use too much because you're dipping raw chicken in it so when you get done you're going I throw it away so anyway and here I have one tablespoon of cornstarch one tablespoon of water and we're going to use this to thicken our sauce later we're going to go ahead and mix it up that way it's ready whenever we are so what was almost up to temperature but I'm not quite there we're going to start doing we're going to start taking some of these chicken pieces and give them a light dusting of this flour kind of set them to the side now when my oil gets the temperature I'll be ready I can start dropping them in alright oil temperature is good and what I was looking for is 350 degrees F we're going to start putting our chicken in nice and slow you don't want to crowd the pan we'll work this in batches what about two minutes in now I want to put just a little bit more color on here if these are floated up and is color it up really good gotta listen to the sound of what your oils doing but it could start getting carried away we're smoking turn the temperature down put some more chicken in there if there if it's not making any sizzling noise and you're not brown probably too cold with your brown and it stops making sizzling noise that means moisture is not no longer coming out and you're overdone we'll take these out clicking our next batch all right we're getting the last little bit of our chicken out of the hot oil set this over to the side now turn my burner down but I'll need it so hot the next step I'm gonna do I'm going up to four off most of this oil Specht I'm going to pour it all off so I'm going to wipe this pan out get rid of all them little chicken bits and such I'll be right back okay so I got my pan wiped out I didn't worry about getting all out just you know pretty good now the chickens got some oil on we're going to put just a little bit this oil back in here turn back probably about to a medium we're going to put our ginger and chili peppers in here seizing that oil up soften the ginger a little bit oh yeah smells good smell a ginger and chili peppers and what I don't want to burn the peppers this will help soften the peppers up it will put some heat into the oil get that ginger flavor into the oil all right we're getting just a little bit of color on our ginger that's good I'm going to stir our sauce up one more time and pour that in and we're going to bring the sauce up to a boil all right that didn't take long sauce is up to a boil now we're going to stir our cornstarch and water mixture you have to do that because the cornstarch will start to settle out and we're going to pour this in we're going to give it a mix thicken our sauce I'm go ahead turn this burner off I really don't need to put any more heat in here there we go now we're going to put our chicken in here and we're going to toss the chicken and we're done I'm gonna plate this up and I'll be right back okay so he'll do I'll put some sesame seeds on here put some green onion on here okay so how does it taste hmm the batter is nice and light it's not hard the sauce is not sweet at all so if you want it sweet add some more sugar but this is really flavorful yes damn Jax and welcome to the grill iron join us as we drop in on the tastiest tailgates you could ever sink your teeth into our cross country food adventure
