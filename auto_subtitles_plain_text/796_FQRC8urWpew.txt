 howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen its Barry here today I'm showing you how to make an easy meatball goulash it smells so so good and the ingredients are minimal you're gonna absolutely love this so hit pause on the video now write them all down this is how you do it it's so so good so the first step is actually cooking up our meatballs now these are some frozen meatballs that I got from Sainsbury's did but there's nothing to stopping you I'm making your own from fresh and either cooking them straight away or putting them in the freezer for a later date and obviously hopefully making this recipe so whack them into an oven proof dish I bake my own for around about 22 minutes gas mark 6 or equipment which I put on the screen right there and just while they're cooking away it's time to move on with some other steps oh yeah so over a medium flame whack down a frying pan and add in a tablespoon of olive oil then follow up by tipping in your chopped onions now those are frozen chopped onions you want to soften them up for around about 5 minutes until they're all translucent and like lush and smelling all good in the kitchen initially and then we're gonna add some more flavor in there so I added in some frozen chopped garlic and also some paprika now stirring that through will stay in it and make it like it's on sunbed but will really add some decent flavor in there now I need to tell you about that garlic that I was using I've got these pots today this is frozen chopped parsley but the garlic and the onions also came in pots like this is so good particularly the onions and the garlic because you can sort of snap them off and then sort of whack them down once you're done no wastage back in the freezer for another day and also with it the onions and the garlic particularly no smelly fingers no crying all that stuff but anyhow what you want to do is add in your tomatoes tin of chopped tomatoes and 300 milliliters of water once that's all in there it will sauce stir it well through those initial flavors start to bring it to a simmer but crumble in a beef stock cube as well get that all in there and again keep stirring it through bringing it to a simmer so while that's simmering away and you've got your meatballs in the oven it's just time to cook up your spaghetti to package instructions so I used some high fiber spaghetti just put that straight into my pan and then we had the spaghetti cooking away the goulash simmering away like bubbling like a cauldron and of course the meatballs too so once the meatballs ready it was time to take them out very very carefully lovely nice color on them and gradually add them into the pan with the thickened goulash sauce so that's really what the stage you want to simmer it to just so it's thickened okay so get the meatballs in there stir it through get it nice and coated then I added a bag of frozen ready chopped peppers you seen a theme here lots of frozen stuff but it's all good we're cooking it straight from frozen how cool is that so the peppers go in and then my good old parsley this is the actual table I use it's so good it's just sprinkle it all on there like that so I'm gonna chop it no wastage as well I can whack that back in the freezer get that all stirred through in there let it simmer all those flavors mingle together for a good five minutes and once you're ready to serve it get you super Getti down on a plate get some of the initial peppers and onions and garlic all down first of all place down some meatballs as well little bit more juice on top and if you want you can finish it with a little sprinkling of Oregon oh so so good I hope you'll agree that is looking pretty darn stocking time to taste it yeah here we go mmm shiver me timbers guys
