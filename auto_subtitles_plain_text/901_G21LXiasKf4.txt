 I'm going to welcome to Nicko's kitchens fast food Friday today we're making a favorite of everybody and it's all over jus that I make some today we're making my homemade cheeseburgers so the first thing that we're going to do is get started on our beef patties now into a bowl here I'm going to add in some ground beef or some minced beef now I'm going to season with some salt and pepper I'm going to add in one egg I'm also going to add in some Dijon mustard and it just gives the burger a nice kick and I'm also going to add in some bread crumbs and it just helps bind the burger together now guys using your hands make sure they're nice and clean just mix it through but I want you to be careful because I don't want you to really squeeze the meat because if we do that we're going to make our burger too dense so I just want you to gently just gently move it about get everything combined until it all comes together so guys that's all you have to do and I tell you that is the best cheeseburger you'll ever have so let's start cooking these bad boys off now you could barbecue our burgers of course but if you don't have a barbecue I'm going to show you what you can do inside so just into a pan I'm going to add in some vegetable oil so what I've done guys is I've just got our patties and I've just modeled them into a burger patty just like that okay so you want about that thick for the best result so straight into the pan now you only want to turn these once guys okay to keep turning them we're going to lose all that juiciness from the inside but of course you need them cooked through each side we'll need about six to seven minutes on a low to medium heat nice and slow because if the heats up too high you'll burn them and it will be raw in the middle so about six or seven minutes each side medium heat and then turn it over and repeat that so that's the color we're after guys with our burgers now I'm going to leave them to rest five minutes and while they're resting I've got some cheese okay now I've got some gels Berg cheese you use whatever cheese that you want to but I do love the flavor of this cheese on the burgers but if you want to use cheddar by all means go for it so it's as easy as this just lay it over the top of that burger and it will melt just sitting there so I've just transferred our burgers to another plate and using the same pan I'm going to fry off some onions so the onions won't take on guys over a medium to high heat just keep steering them make sure that our burner what we're after is a beautiful caramel color and they start to go nice and soft so our onions are done so let's start assembling these bad boys so guys on top of our burger bun that we've got here I'm going to put on some tomato sauce and spread it around all around onto the sides there I'm going to place on our burger patty I'm going to spoon over some of those onions and guys just before I put the top on have a look at that absolutely gorgeous with the beef the cheese the onion core and just put the top on the burger here we go that burger is so juicy look at that oh man so guys being a burger you could put anything on there that you want you could put lettuce tomato pickle beetroot if you wanted to it's up to you but make sure you give this a go because it is going to be the best homemade cheeseburger you've ever had in your life all the ingredients to make this cheese burger are below check it out you take care and I'll see you this Monday for mystery Monday so make sure you get your 6 or less random ingredients into me and I'll see you then
