 Bistro gentil in beautiful Yountville California is world famous for its tomato soup in croute hi I'm chef Jason Hill and Chef Philippe has generously shared this recipe with us so we're gonna make it back home beast crews on Team Yountville California has been rated one of the top ten restaurants in America after eating here I know why the food is simple yet extraordinary we're fortunate enough that the restaurant shares its famous recipe with us whether you dine at the restaurant or go to their website now this recipe is not on the healthy side but sometimes it's fun to indulge this recipe calls for simple ingredients that you can find at your local market from the puff pastry which you can find in frozen section two fresh tomatoes if you can't find ripe fresh tomatoes you can use a canned tomato product whole Tomatoes about 28 ounce can also onion it calls for a half a pound which is about a half of a large a minute the recipe calls for sliced onions that we add to our half a cup or one stick of butter we're gonna stir these cover for about five minutes we don't want them to color we just want them to cook down now we're gonna core tomatoes and quarter them [Music] this has been about five minutes and that's what you want you can see the onions aren't colored they just softened I'm going to stir in the garlic and then we're gonna add the tomatoes have a tomato paste half a tablespoon of pepper corns teaspoon of dried thyme I like to break my time up with my fingers as I add it to recipes a drop in the bay leaf and let this simmer for 40 minutes on low while the soup has been simmering it's giving me time to put together the next items I'll need for this recipe I'll need a strainer a blender a spatula and the heavy cream it's always good to stay one step ahead while you're preparing a recipe after 40 minutes tomatoes onions and garlic are very soft now this is ready to be pureed I like to use an immersion blender you can use a regular liquid blender or a food processor to puree the soup after blending for a good minute or two it's time for the strainer to push the soup through the strainer you can use a rubber spatula now I'm going to place the soup back into the stock pot add the cream salt and pepper bring to a boil and then we're gonna chill stir that up and add teaspoon of sea salt and a half teaspoon of white pepper as soon as this comes to a boil and I turn it off I'm gonna put it in the bowls and I'm gonna chill it the recipe says for two hours but I recommend overnight to get the flavors to meld okay it's starting to boil it's time to remove from the heat I almost forgot the recipe calls for more butter either a tablespoon or two got about a tablespoon here I'm gonna add the soup to the crocks leaving about Oh three quarters of an inch of space because when you add the puff pastry to the bowl you don't want the puff pastry to touch down into the soup the soup is chilled it's time to cover it with a sheet of puff pastry the recipe says you'll need a little bit more puff pastry to hang over the bowl so to do this I just lay a bowl that I'm gonna serve it in over the puff pastry cut a circle around the bowl leaving just enough edge to cover the bowl now that I've cut my thawed puff pastry I'm gonna mix up my egg wash which is one egg and one tablespoon of water brush your egg wash onto one side of the puff pastry now the egg wash side down place over your clock and try and tighten it like a drum and make sure the puff pastry does not fall down and touch into the soup now immediately lightly brush some more egg wash on top of the puff pastry and we're gonna place this into a pre heated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes now remember not to open up your oven door while this is baking what the puff pastry is set what an amazing example of French country cuisine simple delicious and elegant if you're looking for a great way to blow your diet I highly recommend finding this recipe thanks for tuning in [Music]
