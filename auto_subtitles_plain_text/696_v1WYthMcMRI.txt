 hey there welcome back everybody we did our fettuccine alfredo that was quickly devoured by my onset guests Matt and Ron our floor guys here at monadnock flooring and now what we're going to be making is penne alla vodka again another simple dish and we'll go over and say hi to the guys again hi guys Thank look how was it fatal good yeah doing awesome you have to tell everybody that we didn't just eat that no yeah everybody went pretty quick well I next dish is something that we make at the restaurant a lot but again it's one of those things people go how do you make it can I do that at home and that's what we're going to do is penne alla vodka and luckily I found some absolute citron which I don't know where that came from well if that's an absolute citron to make this with so let's get back to our pan and get cooking little olive oil and heat in the pan on medium-high we're going to add our punch at that first it's the most important ingredient pancetta is a cured bacon from Italy that is basically or it can be made the United States but basically what they do is say take the same items like a bacon or take the same thing like a bacon and cure it in salt wear bacon is sometimes smoked this pancetta is cured in salt you could actually what's great and people always cringe at this but they telling you about it take sliced punch yet a little bit of tomato lettuce extra virgin olive oil on a sandwich it's phenomenal so if you like it's a talia version of a BLT but you don't even have to cook it what we're doing is rendering some of the fat out of the pancetta which is mostly fat just like bacon is and we want to add that to the flavor of what we're going to be making as far as the panelle vodka so we get that cooking we're going to go over here we're going to get our roasted garlic and add that to it now however you like your pancetta to be rendered down some people really like it crispy like you do bacon they like that real crispiness I like to get a little little chewiness from it because it's going to cook a little bit more as we go now the other thing that we're going to do what you need to know about it sometimes people say to me well I can't find fun Chetta right you say that guys I can't yeah okay great good thanks man so you can't find pancetta what do I use well don't use bacon unless you like that smoky flavor what you want to use is prosciutto or pancetta those are more similar but they're both cured items and they both work the same way so we have shallots attitude to the dish again i love shouts what we're gonna do is take this away just a little bit we're going to add some of our vodka and we're going to just bring that back we don't want to get any claim oh look at that that was wrong all right when you do it at home and basically you don't want to do that when you're at home unless you know what you're looking for what I'm doing it's plumb bang and here's here's the thing flambe how important is it to the dish a little bit what you want to do is cook off some of that bitterness that alcohol has right off at the top and by Flom bang you're helping that evaporate now when you're doing it my recommendation is pull it away from the stove and get it back on as evenly as possible when you put it in tilt it just a little bit the fat molecules pop up with the vapor spray and the alcohol is kind of pulled up with it and pal that's where we have that excitement it looks great for camera though and nothing went off look at that it's a beautiful thing that's our little test and see if we're going to turn on any alarms here from there we're going to add a little bit of Mahdi nah no socks I pre make my mahdi not a sauce of course and may I like making my own but if you wanted to use a sauce that you pre-buy that's fine also we're going to let that cook in there so we have shallots garlic pancetta need the season we didn't cease until this point we'll get a little seasoning in there I will let that cook down a little bit what do you think I so far it smells great yeah let's play with really easy all right I mean we really didn't do too much again it's in one pan this will be enough for two and I'm going to add our cream you know our magic cream that's the magic part of the whole show is how it really brings together some all these flavors around it before we made a straight cream sauce and that straight cream sauce was the alfredo and now we're going to use it in our Piniella vodka to just break down all the other strong flavors the pancetta is strong the shallots are showing the garlic's are strong and then you have this great tomato and now you're just going to bring it all together with the with the cream so now we're just going to kind of move that around in a pan and let that come together and get our pasta ready and come back over and talk to the guys here and we also have a bottle of wine we're going to drink with this segment why not you know can't have pasta without one get a vodka and pasta without wine it's all about that so this is a bottle of Rosa Beach Anna which is a blended sangiovese and multiple channel great these two grapes work well together the multiple channel what you're going to have on it is initially it's going to have that nice nice big big mouth feel right and then afterwards it's going to go smooth that sandrov is is a smoother great that's our wine segment of the day and we're learning a little bit about everything here so you guys usually drink wine or with your pasta or what was going to ask boy read why read your pasta for me it's red with cream okay anything that's heavy and rich and has this real big body to it whether it's pasta whether it's even a fish if I'm doing a cream sauce around fish sometimes at night I like nice smooth red wines so that was a great question to you go gentlemen enjoy that because your pastas coming up soon and then last time it takes to open a bottle of wine we started getting a nice cream sauce so look at that as I move it away from the pan see how it leaves a little bit it's like parting the penne vodka see so let's turn this down and as I did before that was fun that was good that was good I come up with these on the flight as i did before what I'm doing is incorporating the pasta into the sauce pan Nettie got a that's what these are pendente got there they got that just means ridges right and so what we're doing is we take the ridges and we get the sauce incorporated into the whole thing that's what it's all about about all these flavors coming together and just a little bit of a toss which takes just a little practice not to dirty our beautiful stove there and we have the sauce incorporated it's nice and rich and thick and the only thing I need to do is get it over to these guys with their wine and here we go a little bit for you my friend thank you so this this design center that we're in right now is pretty awesome we have a lot of different things in here and we'll probably get a scan around the place but this was built and the set was built with the idea of displaying kitchens but then was it with the idea of you eating all the time to write absolutely then you called me up and made me cook yeah it worked out perfect and it works out great for all here we go a little Potter medrano cheese over the top let's give it a shot guys try it out that's our second pasta dish now we're going to come back and do a little bit more variety right now we're just in tomato and cream or just straight cream and cheese but we're going to start adding vegetables to it so for those of you looking for a great vegetarian dish it dig in guys because it's always good to eat down well talk and when you're thinking about a really good vegetarian dish how do we finish that with cream you'll see it all right after this culinary minute you
