 so here I have a cups of water and we're gonna go ahead and put the ribs in the pots and wait for it to boil okay so now let's get the vegetable ready first we're gonna gonna pound the shallots to release its flavor I don't pound at heart like I did I smashed a thing next you're gonna also pound the Julie pepper and then make a slit cut in the middle and put it aside okay the lemongrass the part where you cut in like about two inch or three inch slice thick now you can slice it in half and then you cannot pound it but don't use the back of the knife like I did it's very dangerous you can use any are too hot you know heavy tools to pound it okay and the rest I'm gonna thinly slice them and put aside and never with the galangal it's very strong flavor you don't have to use too many I only use for slice in the soup today this is very very strong flavor okay now the water is boiling so go back to the pot and steam out the gunk on the soup make sure you keep doing this until the water get clearer and the for me talk and have a little white color in it it means that the most of the dirty gunk already come out so continue until you you remove all of them like this okay after this we're just gonna go ahead and lower the heat down to low and then after you load the heat down you can add in the rest of the ingredients which is the shallots the lemongrass and the hot chili pepper if you want to if you would like the flavor of lemongrass you can use more than one stock and if you like more spicy you can add dried chili peppers in all of your light now cover the lid and let it simmer and cook for about 30 minutes 20 minutes okay it's been 30 minutes let's see how they're doing perfect it looked like the wrist is tender now so this is a good time where we're gonna add the rest of the lemongrass and the seasonings I don't want to add the lemongrass the other half of the lemon grass so soon because it's gonna flavor kind of dined out a little bit so it by adding it later it's gonna make it more fresher the flavor for your lemongrass and then you can add in the fish sauce if you like most we cannot add more sugar but here I have only three tablespoon of sugar it's perfectly for the pot that I cook today with a cup of water salt and finally the chicken powder like I say if you want more sweet more salty just add a little more fish sauce and the sugar only and here's the hot chili pepper crushed or flecked a lot of people call it you can add more if you like more spiciness but I think this is good amount of spice for the soup okay just pour them all in and right now this is the good time for you just to taste a little bit of it so this is a final step in cooking the soup we kind of put all the vegetables in here I have cabbage and again you can use bean sprout or carriage of mushroom or any vegetable you prefer okay I'm gonna cook up about two or three more minutes or until it's a little bit tender not too too tender I like it stay crunchy and now we're gonna prepare the herbs when I cut the culantro in little slice thinly slice put it aside and with the line we can start to go ahead and cut the line in half or you can cut it in little pieces if you want I just want to prepare the juice ahead of time so I don't have to squeeze it in every time I need it okay see this this is my lime juice it's very cute I use it a lot we've got a lot of juice our farm line and before we begin I like to tell I'll show you how to pick a good line you want to pick the one with the shiny skin you see that how shiny and thin it is you got a lot of choose from it you don't want to want that to dry and then kind of bumpy okay so just squeeze it all out okay after we finish you can put it aside in a bowl for later serving like I said you can cut blinding watches if you like this is just more convenient okay so now we're going to get ready to scoop out the mix and ready to eat now with the line add as much as you like it depend house how we wanted it's supposed to be sweet sour and little bit salty enjoy
