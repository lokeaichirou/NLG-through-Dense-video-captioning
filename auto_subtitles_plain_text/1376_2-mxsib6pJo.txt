 [Music] how about some clam chowder I'm going to use some clam juice and some heavy cream and here I have three pans of clams I'm using bacon and some Idaho russet potatoes a little bit of parsley and two bay leaves and carrot celery and flour salt and pepper I've been heating my product over medium-high heat and this is three pieces of bacon it's thick bacon six why cook this up the Bacon's gotten crisp so I'm going to remove it from the pot I'm going to add the bay leaves two bay leaves carrot celery and you know what I forgot to tell you about this the onions about a medium onion or one cup of onion and then this in there and cook this till it gets soft the vegetables gotten soft I'm going to add the flour it's about three tablespoons of flour and just mix this in and cook the flour for a minute maybe two minutes I've taken my clams and I've drained them I'm going to add the juice from the hands of plants I will also add 2 cups of clam juice and the 1 cup of cream oops and my potatoes that cubed up in small dice there bow the half inch made me less maybe smaller about a half inch and want to let this come up to temperature its come up to a bubble it's come up to temperature or a bubble that's what we want we want to let this go like this for 20 minutes it's been going 20 minutes take the bay leaves out well that was one of them oh there is the other one take it out I want to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt stir that in you want to taste it now for salt and see if you need any [Music] hmm I think that's fine might need just a dash more and I'm going to take the clams toss those in [Music] and just let these warm for a couple minutes we're ready to play real quick here I'm going to take a pan turn it down a little bit I'm going to add some bread cubes this is a decent bread certainly I don't want to use a ultra cheap bread and we'll stir this around when I make a croutons real quick and I think I'll put a little olive oil in here too a little bit and we'll stir these around while these are toasting up and add a little pepper to I'm gonna add some dried herbs to them add a little bit of garlic powder just a little bit a little bit of parsley and we'll throw in there we keep these moving for just a couple minutes it only takes a couple of minutes to make them serve some up [Music] couple spoonfuls this makes about three quarts and some of our croutons use crackers or even go without [Music] the Baker and just hit it with a little bit of parsley [Music] god it's so nice so good but it's like potatoey and clammy and Velveteen creamy it's so good and thanks so much for watching [Music]
