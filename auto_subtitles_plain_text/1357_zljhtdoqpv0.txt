 hi everyone welcome today we're gonna make some fried calamari we're gonna need a pan of calamari if you want the tentacles also or just kind of money teaspoon of black pepper a teaspoon of seasoning this is a half salt half garlic if you are in the u.s. you can get gorgeou which is good about two cups of oil 2 cups of flour when to serve it we're gonna need a little some lemons and Tabasco sauce which is good but you can use tartar sauce or any sauce you like for seafood so let's get started okay so for our flour we're gonna mix the seasoning and the pepper we're gonna put it in the flour and we're gonna mix it together until it's well combined and after that we're gonna cut the calamari and about a quarter inch or half centimeter take a thick like this you just need a sharp knife and that's it so you're gonna cut them just like this very easy and for the tentacles we're not going to do nothing to them because they already came clean and everything in the package so this they're gonna stay like this so now that you have cut it the calamari I have already the flour ready so we'll try to keep the Calamari's wet and we're just gonna drop them in the flour and just cover them with flour as much as you can and after that after you see they're all covered from both sides here in here you just wanna take them out of the flower try to take the excess out we're gonna put them in a platter for about five minutes we don't need much because if you fry them right now the flower is going to get out of there in they're not going to fry it very well so just wait five to ten minutes and then we're gonna heat the oil for the tentacles very easy just take one and the same thing cover it with flour and after that after it is well covered just take out the excess so it's been about ten minutes another if you can tell the flour it doesn't look like dry it's becoming to get wet so this is what we want now we're going to start to heat the oil we're gonna need a temperature of 180 Celsius or 360 Fahrenheit and this is a very hot temperature so keep in mind that use your biggest flame so that you can get this temperature okay guys so now the oil has got the temperature of 360 Fahrenheit this is before the the oils it starts to Katlin like smoke so it's a little bit before that so if you got the smoke like I am right now just lower the temperature and take it away for maybe like 20 seconds and the temperature is going to drop this is just to show you if you don't have a thermometer but okay right so now that we got the temperature we're going to start frying them in frying them for one minute maybe a minute and a half because if you go over that they will become like rubber just go little by little don't put too much when when you see they're like this color just take them out there these are ready just keep the heat on tight so that you can keep the temperature and I'm gonna keep frying until I finish all of them every time you take some Calamari's out wait maybe like one minute so that the temperature goes up again the heat is on high still always on high just making sure the temperature is high now it's been like one minute we're gonna start putting some more in there okay guys so here in a big batter we have place of lettuce leaves a little bit of Tabasco sauce and of course the calamari rings and this is the final dish it's very good I know you guys are gonna like it so don't forget to comment rate and subscribe see you next time bye
