 today I'm making homemade sauerkraut which is a great way to get probiotics into your diet and not as hard as people make it out to be first I'm going to cut the end off the cabbage you can leave in as much of the core as you want I generally find that it's a little harder and not so pleasant so I will cut out most of it this is generally the simplest way and I will be fermenting this in a crock that I bought at Ace Hardware it was about $20 for this crock it's a one gallon sized crock and I bought a new crop because they say that it's very easy to leach lead out of the old crocks if they have any kind of crack at all in their finish and so I thought it was worth it to buy a new crop just for this purpose but without having to spring like a hundred dollars for one of the fancy fermenting crops this works just as well with the trick I will show you at the end for keeping the sauerkraut submerged nicely for fermenting I'm trying to cut my cabbage pretty thin because you don't really want huge chunks of sauerkraut you want to be able to get just just as much sauerkraut as you want and not hear strings so once I finished slicing it fairly thinly I'll turn it like this and cut across about three times so all those shreds of cabbage are a reasonable length and then just drop them right in the crock here when you're fermenting the cabbage you really want it to be completely submerged in water because the good bacteria are anaerobic they grow without the presence of oxygen and the bad bacteria that might take over if you're not careful require the presence of oxygen so loves everything's in there you want it to make sure you want to make sure it is completely submerged in liquid the fermenting process and the fermenting process pretty much takes as long as you want it to you want to leave it for at least a week usually I leave it for somewhere between two or three weeks whenever I think oh hey I had summer cup fermenting around here somewhere I wonder if it's ready yet so there's the cabbage this is big enough that I can do two heads of cabbage if I want but then it's very full at the beginning before it it is compressed down so it's simpler to deal with if I just do one head of the time for one head of cabbage I'm going to put on a tablespoon of salt this is my usual pink Himalayan sea salt full of lots of good minerals and I just sprinkle that over the cabbage and you can let it sit for a few minutes I will go ahead and start working the salt into it now this works better on a lower surface because I'm short and it helps to get your body weight down into it but you just start tossing it to get the salt evenly distributed and then start squeezing and pressing on the cabbage and in just a few minutes the cabbage will start releasing liquid and you will your cabbage will take up a lot less space and the liquid usually for me will almost cover the cabbage I always have to add a little bit of filtered water so that it's completely submerged and this process will take a few minutes and as slightly energetic requires a little bit of muscle after a couple minutes of working and squeezing this it's compressed down packed pretty tightly there in the bottom of the pot it's a lot moister than it was when I started normally I can tell it's done when the liquid is just coming up almost to the service of the cabbage when I press on it like this and I press it down very firmly you'll want it packed in there very tightly for the next step this cabbage is not releasing quite as much water but that is perfectly fine I'll just add a little more filtered water so that submerged and once it is packed in there tightly I will add my water and then I will show you my trick for keeping it submerged I learned from My Father I have water probably till it's just about an inch or two above the surface of the cabbage you have a little bit floating at this point kind of hard to show you with the angle of the camera there but that there's what it looks like when it's tilted and I will go get a gallon size ziploc bag and then I'm going to fill this part way with water this is not going to come in contact with the sauerkraut so I'm just using normal tap water here and I put probably two ports or so of water in the bag usually maybe a little less it just needs to be enough to make a good seal on the sauerkraut and then in order to seal it tightly I close the zip on most of the bag and then tilt it so that the water is there and then there's just this small portion here where I'm letting the air out to get as tight as seal as possible mostly that just makes it easier to work with it doesn't have to have no air left in it it's just easier if it's mostly water and then I just drop this down on top of the cabbage and you'll see a little bit of water come up around the edges of the bag but the cabbage will stay neatly submerged under the bag and of course the bag form fits to the edges of the container so it makes a really good seal on there keeping all of the air out so the bad bacteria you can't work I'll usually throw just a dish towel on top of this especially if I'm letting it sit in some other room in the kitchen to keep the dust and whatever out of it and then like I said just let it sit for two to three weeks or you can even let it sit for several months usually after two or three weeks I'll take it out and put it in mason jars in refrigerator but obviously this is a technique that was used for a long time for preserving the sauerkraut without refrigeration so it's perfectly buy and let it sit this way for months and just continue to sour and that's homemade sauerkraut
