 hi welcome to Alexis kitchen today I'm going to make me - mixing so for the - winter you will need a very thin piece of veal I have an egg wash here with two eggs and some milk and salt and pepper I'm going to whisk up and combine all the ingredients and then you're going to need some flour and some bread crumbs we need a lemon for the decoration later we need some safflower oil decks for to bake the schnitzel in the pan and I like to use the safflower oil because it's neutral and taste it can take a lot of heat I need to better and I need a little bit of olive oil because I need to flatten out my schnitzel I don't have one of those meat hammers to pound the schnitzels I'm just gonna use the back of my pan I have a little bit of saran wrap here which I'm going to put a little bit of olive oil on read that out put my piece of veal you see this is already pretty thin but the middle could be a little thinner put this on here add another piece of saran wrap and I'm going to put a little bit of olive oil on top of the meat so it doesn't stick to the ceramic there you go so it's powder meat you're ready so that's good so we're going to start with our flower and you really just want to thin layer of flower so don't press the flower in there just sprinkle a generous on top make sure you get a great piece of meat and make sure you shake off the excess flour there you go now it goes into our egg wash and now it goes into the breadcrumbs and you don't want to press your breadcrumbs in there because a traditional media schnitzel has its very loosely breaded and it's supposed to sort of come away from the meat when it's done in the pan and it will create our little waves so we don't want to press the breadcrumbs in there so to just sprinkle them on top and that's how it should look and now let's go over to the stove and fry our let's turn some light on so you see something turn the oven on the stove on and in goes our safflower oil oops you need to open that one first and you want lots of oil in the pan you want your schnitzel to sort of swim around in there and we need some water and make sure this is really hot before you put your schnitzel in there you see all the bubbles which is a sign that the the the pan is hot and the oil is hot and the butter has heated up so let's add our schnitzel and now I said to you earlier the Schnitzer should swim in the pan and we're going to make these movements here back and forth you got to be careful because everything is really hot of course I don't know if you can see this but you see how the crust is coming up here and here that's how this should be we have beautifulness coming back down orchid I think we can flip it now see y'all even on this side we have those beautiful way gonna be so yummy I think Ashley's twins ready look at this beautiful color and I've laid my schnitzel on a little paper towel so it can all the excess oil can go in there so now all we need is a little piece of lemon here that will go on top of our schnitz it and there you go can you see this perfectly - mixing so I'm going to go enjoy this thank you so much for joining me today I will see you next time in Alexis kitchen bye-bye
