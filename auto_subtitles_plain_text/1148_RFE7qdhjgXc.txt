 [Music] hey youtubers my name is Amy and I'm Julie and with the doping substance welcomed our kitchen today we're doing chicken fried noodles now everyone knows what a delicious plate of fried noodles tastes like but we're going to show you the secret to the juices amusing ever had so let's get started so for these amazing noodles we're just going to keep it really simple we've got some egg noodles bean sprouts broccoli some thinly sliced carrot diced up ginger and garlic and chicken thigh cut into strips so the first thing we're going to do is start by marinating our chicken so I've got 300 grams of chicken thigh here now we really recommend using thigh instead of breast meat for this dish because it is just that much more juicy and today we just add a really classic marinade of half a teaspoon of light soy sauce 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of sugar a pinch of pepper and 2 tablespoons of water we're also going to add 1/2 spoon of corn flour and a quarter of a teaspoon of baking soda to find out why we use these 2 magic ingredients check out our pots take a video on food tube while the chicken is marinating we're going to get the noodles ready now we think you'll all agree that fancy noodles are much better than soggy ones and a stir fry and to achieve that we always cook our noodles just so that it's just softened because they'll keep cooking in the wok pour some boiling water over 250 grams of thin egg noodles and we may start to loosen up give them a swivel chop is it great for this now when they're just soft and bouncy like a tangle of elastic bands quickly drain them in a colander and you're good to go ok we're ready to start cooking so we're gonna start with the chicken get your wok superhot do we want to add about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil add in half of the ginger and garlic then later chicken out in a single layer so though it can get some nice color on there let the chicken do its thing for a couple of minutes then start flipping it so it ends up nicely browned all over then add in 60 milliliters of water and cover very quickly so that we can trap in all of those lovely flavors so the magic that's happening on the wok right now is that the cornflour in the water is forming this beautiful slick gravy that's gonna copy every strand of noodles that's how we get them so juicy without adding loads of oil give it a minute to cook the chicken through then scoop everything out into a clean bowl and set aside and go is one tablespoon of oil in the rest of the garlic and ginger let that through the little way into a fragrant then add in half a handful of carrots a whole handful of bean sprouts and a handful of broccoli give it a good stir to cook the fish through properly we're gonna give it some steam all you have to do is add an eighty miles of cold water stick a lid on it and then it cooks through turn the heat down to low so the vegetables don't firm I'll add in the rest of the ingredients for the noodles cut them up slightly it's very easy to toss you can do this with a pair of scissors if you like and go the noodles now pour that lovely gravy on top along with the chicken to season and we're using 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt one and a quarter teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of dark soy slide each spatula down the side of the wok until the meat in the middle then the fauces them up at the same time along with bunch of noodles give the noonas a little jiggle at the top then release key rotation this until everything is mixed together in the noodles that heat it through all there is to it guys chicken fried noodles Oh delicious they smell amazing too for those beautiful colors so the inner thighs chicken fried noodles super juicy and soo  greedy and you know what there's greedy and you know what there's no shame in using a fork Yeah right really plump noodles mm-hmm all right thank you very much for watching and we're gonna finish this off he asked know if you guys make it yeah on social media if you do cuz we love seeing photos of the things you make and then it's just really hot looking for us okay so I think's very true this and see you next time bye [Music] you
