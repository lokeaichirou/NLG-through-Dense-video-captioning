 this weed recipe is a great pub classic but we are going to be using lemonade so this is a really simple pub classic dish with like calamari we're going to cut our squid into rings and then batter it in a really simple lemonade and pure call so that's interesting very few ingredients yeah we're going to start with our fresh squid so Jay if you can take this okay and now this brings already been prepared it's been skinned okay so it's taken off that called cartilage at the middle all been prepped for us by our fishmonger ups that we need to do is cut it into rings sort of about your finger thickness little finger maybe okay perfect and even these little bits at the end although they're not uniform in shape like the rest don't waste them they're actually grating to squiddy's really cheap to these fresh squid less than one pound fifty no from the supermarket why you do that I'm going to show you the batter which is so simple it's more like a tempura batter okay so you need flour this is just self raising flour so it's light so we've got a bit of sort of raising agent in it and the key is ice-cold fizzy liquid so we make tempura yeah use sparkling water ice cold yeah to go with the squid we're going to use a cloud eliminate all okay so lemonade still got a few ice cubes in there we needed to be cold okay and if you can just whisk that in Jen have an exception of the few ice cubes should be completely lump free season up well salt and pepper you can see all those bubbles reacting with the self-raising flour as well really light and fluffy and that's it we've got our script ready to go you can of course get these frozen already in the ring so you could even get rid of that job and we've got our batter which is nice and smooth if you can just put screed back into our bolt yep so we've got over here some hot oil is that 180 degree Celsius you have got a fryer by all means use a pan of oil on the stove but be careful but be careful you do need it quite precise it's too low you'll get soggy better too high and squid won't cook before the batter Burton so I've got to be careful but we want to do take this really light crispy batter and just pop them in to our oil probably how easy this is the squid will cook really quickly so you want to get a few in at once so they all cook together perfect more leave those to cook for that two or three minutes and to make a nice and crispy very very simple dip to go with it x squared we don't want a too many flavors to overpower it so just mayonnaise and lemon juice which you could not juice zest if you just destined lemon into that and plenty of black pepper so really simple flavors do you have fun memories of squid I do actually it really reminds me of sitting in Spain on the beach in a little chillin ghee top which little barfing out there Vito in the speedos we appear the Sun and the beach lemon mayonnaise goes into our dip pot we'll start get ready to serve we've got a little fry basket here just because it looks kind of cool some fresh rocket just to soak up any of that excess grease and four-color and over here I'll squared up already done as one lifters I've got nice golden color just grid in the middle cook so just drain off any excessive amounts of oil on there you can do tentacles they do like this weekend yeah you don't just have to use the body of the squid you could do the tentacles as well that's a little bit of salt just to season it up as well and that's literally all you need so slight twist from the usual by using that cloudy lemonade but it gives that fantastic crispy batter you can hear that there so there we go exactly as we want it our cloudy lemonade squid sorted ah let's taste this Gretchen is as good as once you have a holiday that is lovely that is really good lemonade let you not just crispy it's slightly sweet yep and the rocket from the lemon juice mm-hmm pink food pop food or something also easy do double Christmas right hmm was lovely that's amazing Lou
