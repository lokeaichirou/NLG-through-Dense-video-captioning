 okay guys so today we're doing another recipe from our eat well lose weight I guess series and this is what I'm making today they have sections in this book well they have all all sections but like the main course or sides and all that stuff and then after that they have like a section where it breaks down kind of different types of food or different regions so there's an Asian section in the instruction Italian section it gives you a couple of recipes so I picked the Asian section because i really love Asian food I love tofu now we are going to be making tofu and veggie pot stickers with a dipping sauce um I believe how many is it three pot stickers and 1 tablespoon of sauce is 132 calories so this is a very very very good dinner to eat this is not going to give you a lot of calories and I actually went online to better homes and garden to actually look up the recipe when I couldn't find the book the pot stickers themselves are actually only eight calories per serving those extra calories you get comes from the dipping sauce so if you didn't want to use those the dipping sauce and save on calories you can actually do that which will drastically change the calorie count for this but let's get into the ingredients first you have some tofu and this calls for half of an eight ounce package of tofu or roughly nine ounces my grocery store only carries one brand of tofu and one size which is the 14 ounce size so all you really need is nine ounces so if you have a 14-ounce sighs just a little bit more than half of that package now I like to get the extra firm time because is I prefer the texture of it if you don't care or if your grocery store has a bunch of different types of tofu get whatever one you prefer but I'm a texture person and I like the texture of the extra firm also you need to join this and a good way to drain it if you don't well after you drain just the plain water out of the container I mean you need to drain it so it's still not as moist if you have a tofu press that's perfect if not take your tofu and I should have videoed this but I forgot take Utah foo and put it on some paper towel and then stack heavy things on top of it I put a pot and a couple of bowls on it and put some more paper towel on top and let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes and you see all that moisture let me see if I can wring it out all of that got squeezed out of the tofu so that's a good way because you don't want all that in your pot stickers because i'll make them soggy then we have two tablespoons of green onion about two small green onions chopped up one I'm sorry one-third cup of shredded carrot one third cup of broccoli slaw and a good thing if you guys are shopping in advance by the fresh broccoli saw and throw it into the freezer because that's what I did you can do that with the broccoli slaw because all the did it broccoli carrots and cabbage all that stuff is easy to freeze you're supposed to have one tablespoon of plum sauce I had plum sauce that expired a year ago and I didn't realize it so i have 1 tablespoon of duck sauce because i have a whole bunch of pack of the duck sauce and 1 egg white beaten i have the all whites in the container and you see the zero weight watcher points so here gives you a breakdown of the equivalent of it note says three tablespoons three tablespoons of egg whites approximately is one large egg and I just need one egg white so I'm going to put two tablespoons because I'm assuming when they say the large egg there including the yolk in it as well so i'm going to put two tablespoons for one egg white ok guys is one other thing I forgot to tell you about this recipe I don't like it so I didn't include it um if you like water chestnuts the recipe does call for two tablespoons of chopped drained water chestnuts but I don't like them so I didn't put them in so now we are going to combine our egg whites our green onion our duck sauce our carrots our broccoli slaw and one-and-a-half teaspoons of water now before I add my tofu in i'm going to give this a quick nick just so that everything is coated add your tofu in alright guys so now you have to move really quickly with this you want to add about a teaspoon of filling into the center of your wonton wrapper moisten the edges with a little bit of water don't use egg wash because you don't want to add any additional calories then quickly pick it up and pinch it together diagonally now be gentle so you don't rip them because I ripped my very first one and make sure you're getting the air bubbles out of it and just make sure it's sealed you may have to go over it one or two times with your fingers to make sure that you have all the air out and that it's sealed then on a flower sheep just push it down and press it down just so that it has a small flat bottom if you press it down too hard and it opens up just pinch it but you do want to press it down gently so that the bottom is flat so i'm going to finish these up and i'll be back so here all the pot stickers put on the tray this is such a time-consuming process alright so first thing you want to do is to heat two teaspoons of vegetable oil on medium high heat at the bottom of your skillet and just add half of your pot stickers in your skill at a time just and cook them for about one minute just until they are lightly browned and don't let them touch that's why you only add in half of them and if you have press them down a little bit on your baking tray to make the bottoms of them flat they'll stand up in the pan really easy now once you they brown a little bit go ahead and add half a cup of water reduce your heat cover this and cook it for about five minutes i'm going to show you guys the bottom of one see that's nice and brant women can't see you that's nice and brown all right after five minutes go ahead on and remove the cover and let this cook for about three or four minutes or until all the water has evaporated now after the water evaporates if your bottoms had not browned in the beginning you would want to let them cook for a one or two minutes without anything in it so they can brown buttons mine did brown once this water evaporates I'm just going to remove it so let them cook for about three or four minutes until all the waters bomb alright guys so all my water is evaporated and i'm going to pick one up so you can see the bottom that's the bottom i'm going to go it on and remove these and put them on a cooling rack and finish them up so i'll be done after they're all i'll be back after they're all done so we're going to be making the dipping sauce for our wontons I've added two tablespoons of water in here so 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar 3 tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce and you do need to use the low-sodium because you want to count your calories as well as your salt intake you don't want this to salted and 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger now the one thing I do with my ginger I get mine from the farmers market and get a big piece and I just immediately throw it into the freezer you can always armed peel it and then throw it into the freezer but the skin on ginger is so incredibly thin it really doesn't matter but i just took mine off just now really easy with a paring knife and this is still frozen so 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger and one fourth of a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil mine is just plain sesame oil um again guys I don't really think you can substitute any of this stuff because it's not going to have the same flavor one-eighth to one fourth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper depending on how spicy you like it you can always add more now give this a good whisk so that everything is combined and all the flavors are melting and give it a taste too because you can see if you need to add more oil to thicken it up or if you want to even add more seasoning maybe you think it's a little bland but I'm gonna whisk it up and give it a taste this sauce tastes really really good guys you don't need to add anything else to this if you like ginger a walk you could always add a little bit more ginger but it really doesn't it this is a really good dipping sauce and it complements the potstickers very very well because of pasta girls are not overly seasoned and they're also tofu so this tastes really good so I'll be back with pictures and i'll show you my meal
