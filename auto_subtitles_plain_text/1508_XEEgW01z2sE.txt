 all right welcome to cooking with Steve today we're going to be making some beer battered fish and chips Old English pub style and we're going to show you how to do that at home with a little bit of effort and deep fryer but trust me you're gonna love this all right now the first thing you need is fish I happen to be using halibut you could use cod haddock is also nice or  if you have to be thrifty but if you have to be thrifty but this is where we start you're gonna chop it into fillet sized pieces done and these are healthy portions of fish better than you probably ever get from a fish and chip place but that's why you make them at home because they're better so it's maybe better naked I mean beer you can use pretty much any beer the only reason for the beer is to get a little bit of flavor in and also that's gonna give you the bubbles in the better better better so you're gonna dick bowl dump in our beer I got this is a dark beer I just grabbed it on the single cans from the store and in she goes all right the first thing I do is I dump in about a half teaspoon of salt and that really foams up the beer okay now there's no real science to adding the flour you're basically gonna add it until it looks like the consistency of pancake batter and if you've never made pancakes I can't help you here but this is what it looks like you can leave streaks in the batter and then you have to crank your deep fryer right to 375 to cook the fish in now well your oil warms up in deep fryer you're gonna add your last secret ingredient to solid British tablespoons heaping of cornstarch and that's gonna give you the crunch that you're probably gonna want now you have fish and you're gonna need a bowl of flour to flour them up in then you have your bowl of batter now if you're like me and you're messy between the bowl of batter and the deep fryer a parchment paper or wax paper or aluminum foil or whatever makes easy cleanup and a deep fryer set to full blast over 375 and now we begin I'm gonna grab your piece of halibut your Cod or haddock or whatever you choose and you dump that in the flour get her nice and coated because that's gonna let the batter stick to it you throw it in the batter if you're smarter than me you're probably using tongs at this point but once it's coated it goes into the deep fryer and that's where it sits for about five minutes depending on your cut of fish but you're gonna have a great piece of fish when that comes out and you'll know generally by the looks of it when it's done and as the batter forms a crust of coating just give it a little bit of a shake and then will stop it from sticking to the prongs below and that's how she goes yeah use a few songs cuz it'll save on washing up and we've finished cooking our beer battered style English pub style fish and it's ready for serving that's what that thing means but yep that's how it goes end up with something delicious looking like this and this is halibut this is good and this is a crunchy batter and I can no very crunchy batter it's not too thick not too thin and that's what you end up with at the end of this so try this and the fry recipe and also at the tartar sauce recipe because we're enjoying them all together tonight thanks for watching putting the Steve this is what you are cooking
