 today I'm going to be making one of my favorite recipes and these are my potato pancakes I'm using two medium size potatoes a half an onion 1 egg 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour and a half a teaspoon of salt so those are the ingredients so let's get started okay so for our first step what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna chop up my onion just a little bit I'm also gonna peel and cube my potatoes so that's the first thing I'm gonna do I'll come back in a second when that's done so through the magic of YouTube I'm back a second later everything's cubed up so I have my two potatoes cubed and my half an onion cubed and ready for our food processor so I've got my food processor ready to go and at this point I'm just gonna get everything into here just like that perfect and get our lid on Mississippi start pulsing this together so what I want to do here is I'll really really want to turn this into a battery I don't want any chunks left okay let's open that up and now I'll just zoom in a little bit just to show you what it looks like all right I'm zoomed in and I just want to show you this you can see this is full of moisture and that's exactly what I want that you can see that it basically looks like baby food and that is perfect just like that and the next thing we're gonna do we're gonna strain this right so let's get all of this right into our strainer hopefully you can see that let's get that on there like that and what we want to do is just let this sit here for a while until most of the moisture comes out that's good and now you can already see all the beautiful potato water that's coming out of here so at this point you can just leave it like that and head off and do something or you can spread it around a little bit just so that it strains a little bit faster I'm just gonna let that drip a little bit more and then I'll come back so my potato mixture has been sitting here for about five minutes and I'm just going to shake that off a little bit and I'm just going to pour this water out there's a little bit of starch at the bottom here you don't have to worry about that and just take all of your mixture now and just pop back right in there to this we're gonna add in our egg our flour and our little bit of salt so get all that in there then I'm gonna grab a whisk and I'm just going to start whisking this together and I can't tell you how good this recipe is you're gonna make this once and you're gonna be amazed so simple and just so yummy this is one of my favorite recipes I make this all the time you can add a little bit of pepper to this if you wish once it's nicely mixed we are ready to make our pancakes okay I've set up I've got my little hot plate going I'm gonna get a little bit of oil down in my pan just like that I've got a small ice cream scoop here and I'm just gonna scoop up this mixture and I just want to drop it down like that now you can flatten it out if you wish so just take the back of a spoon and just give it a little pat and do another one here and now you just want to fry these on the first side until they're nice and golden-brown I'm gonna just adjust my heat a little bit the secret to these you do not want them browning too quickly you know you just want to have a nice you know low to medium heat on these these are amazing you're gonna take one bite oh you're gonna love them so I'm just gonna let these go a little bit and then we'll flip them so we'll just flip these over enough there we go I wish you could smell these they smell amazing the secret to this recipe is the food processor if you don't have a food processor you're gonna want to use a grater and this I find is a little bit too large you want to go down to something a little bit smaller like this this is a quite small so it's gonna make a really really nice fine great but the food processor is really really magic in this recipe because it turns it into this beautiful batter okay that's about done I'm just gonna check the bottom and that looks perfect so I'll get these off you can put these on paper towel if you wish as well just to drain off a little bit of that oil but they're not bad I'll do another batch you can also just push it down like that as well that's just a little easier and we'll just let those go as well okay that's a minute later or so just flip that one they smell so good so we'll just let these just cook you know another maybe minute or so and then those will be ready and those are nice too let's pop those off and of course you can't have potato pancakes without applesauce or my favorite which is sour cream I'm gonna add a little bit more oil to my pan and I'll just do this one more time and then I'll show you all of them done we'll come back for a little taste test if you do like potatoes I really really encourage you to try these because they are really really amazing you will enjoy these if you love potatoes so we'll just let those go I'll be back in a second let's check these though they look good him a little flip blew it up nice and golden-brown those are oh they smell so good ok these ones are done and what I decided to do was just zoom in and just give you a little bit of a close-up because I think some of you were saying I can't see anything zoom in zoom in so I add in a little bit of oil I'm just using vegetable oil here I'll grab some of my batter let's get that right in there like that you can just take your measuring scoop and just give a little push push push push I'll just let some of that oil get around all of them hopefully the camera is picking up how nice these are I'll just stay around with the camera until I flip them so that you can see the nice golden-brown on the other side okay it's time to flip these there we go well hopefully the camera is picking up how nice those look look at that Oh delicious I just zoomed in a little bit more we'll just let those go for about 30 seconds more I'll finish off the rest and then I'll come back okay so I'm back here are all the beautiful potato pancakes that I made I've got one here to test I'm not sure how many I made here there are quite a few of them I didn't count them now traditionally you're gonna want to eat them with sour cream or applesauce some people will actually put maple syrup on there I just want to flip this over just show you how nice that one is I can show you another one too so you want to have them nice and brown on each side just like that then you're just gonna take a little bit of your sour cream get that on there I'll tell you I'm really finding it hard not to eat a whole pile of these because they smell so good and you just that is really good hmmm if you like potato you're gonna love this recipe I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
