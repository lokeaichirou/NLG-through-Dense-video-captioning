 hi I'm Marika regna with MGB special events in Arlington Virginia and today I'm showing you how to make a romantic dinner for two for your special Valentine and right now we're gonna work on the escargot our appetizer for today and this is what you're going to need in order to do it we're gonna need some nice dishes for baking escargot if you have them if not you could take a pyrex dish just anything that's oven proof oven safe and you can put it in the oven that way we're gonna need some garlic some chopped fresh chives some cleaned and rinsed escargot salt I like to use white pepper for this some cooking sherry will need some butter softened already a bowl a fork and a garlic press so let's get started on our escargot appetizer okay so make sure that you thoroughly rinse off your escargot under cool water use a colander or you could use a bowl that you can see there's you know if not that this is bad put those little parts in there just gently rinsing you could run them under if there's anything that's hanging on just pull it off nice and then we're gonna go ahead and Pat them dry and we're gonna use six six for me and six for you for your romantic date for Valentine's Day and remember always wash your hands okay we've already got it softened so I like to use a fork just to mix it up get it nice and mushy okay and we're gonna take you know probably two or three cloves of garlic can't have enough garlic and we're pressing it all we're really getting out of this is really the garlic juice the skin we can toss aside with okay press another one you could chop this if you want but I love using the garlic press it's so simple it's so easy and I like the results of it that I get out of it so I'm gonna probably do I mean we're only doing 12 escargot today six for me six for you and so I'm gonna use about three cloves of garlic I guess okay that's done just some chives I guess maybe a tablespoon or tablespoon and a half little salt I like to use white pepper I don't know because it doesn't show up as much it is a little bit stronger so you have to go a little easier on it than you would regular pepper and then cooking sherry you can get this at the grocery store you don't have to buy an expensive sherry just any kind of cooking sherry and I'm gonna slowly put that in until I figure after I get the right consistency and I might have to add more but for the meantime I'm just gonna add just a little bit and just marry all of those ingredients together and you can smell it already it smells wonderful you can use this as a basis for so many other different things you could use this as a butter on fillets today we're not going to do that you could use this on fish you could use it on chicken just about anything it's just a wonderful base to make your foods taste so well okay mix that all up together now and our handy dandy little escargot dishes here I'm gonna go ahead and I'm just gonna put a little dollop let's do it this way just a little dollop at the bottom of each one of these just so that when we put the escargot in it doesn't it doesn't burn or it has a nice little base on the bottom now as it as it cooks it's gonna all it's gonna totally submerge the little escargot is which exactly what we want to do all right that's nice now of course if you have extra this it's not a problem I'd rather have more than less don't have to go back and do all the steps again all right and this is a very very simple appetizer but it's sure to please your Valentine okay all right now we're just gonna simply take an escargot pop it in there the nice thing about these dishes is that there's room to have it the butter when it melts to cover it up and you see there's a little rim here it makes it nice just pop each one of those in hopefully I counted right perfect okay now we're gonna take the rest of our butter and just put it on top and I tell you this is so good especially after you've eaten all your escargot and then you want to take some nice butter bread and dip it in this juice it's so good now I've already got my oven preheated at 350 and it really does not take very long to cook this 1518 minutes or until it's bubbling because the escargot is already cooked so you're just gonna get it basically good and hot and it's usually only 15 or 18 minutes okay I like to put it on a cookie sheet case it does happen to overflow it's got lined with tin foil and it won't make your oven all messy okay so let's go on over to the oven okay so here we have our escargot it's been in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 and as you'll see you know when it's ready cuz it's nice and bubbly and hot and it is gorgeous look at that and it just smells so amazing I wish you could smell it and this is a wonderful way to start off your romantic Valentine's dinner and next we're gonna make our Boursin scalloped potatoes to watch the other segments in this video series or for how-to videos on almost any other topic visit monkey-see calm
