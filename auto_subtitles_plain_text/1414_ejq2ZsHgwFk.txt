 [Music] hi welcome to hot chocolate hits today we're combining two breakfasts Oh meal and pancakes to create some moist soft fluffy healthy cinnamony pancakes these are amazing and they taste great with fruit and they're perfect for Sunday breakfast so let's get started you want to start by adding half a cup of whole wheat flour to a bowl along with 1/3 cup of quick cooking oats I used two Quaker kind and a tablespoon of brown sugar for some sweetness you can use granulated sugar if you like next add in a teaspoon of baking powder which makes these pancakes very fluffy and half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon for that warm flavor that goes so well with the oats blend those ingredients together nicely and then crack in one whole egg you can also use two egg whites but I wanted to make do with the whole egg you also want to add in half a teaspoon of vanilla extract for some flavor and two tablespoons of yogurt you can use any kind you like Greek yogurt vanilla yogurt just make sure you add it because it makes these pancakes very very moist mix the ingredients together with a whisk or spoon or a spatula it's a very basic recipe so it doesn't really matter in what order you add the ingredients and I like to start with dry ingredients so that I can get the baking powder evenly distributed throughout the batter now you want to add 2/3 of a cup of milk stir in the milk just until incorporated you want to make sure you don't over mix the pancake batter because that will result in a tough pancake have your a pen that I've greased with a little bit of oil and it's been heating for about five minutes I'm just going to scoop mouthfuls of the batteries in an ice cream scoop so that I get nice even pancakes and I just like to spread it out slightly just to make sure that it's a little bit flatter and more of a circle shape like pancakes are supposed to be you essentially want about a quarter cup of pancake batter for each pancake cook these babies for about two to three minutes or until you see those bubbles pop up on the surface before flipping and then cook for another 2 to 3 minutes make sure using medium heat as you can see they're nice and thick and they're a beautiful golden-brown color now all that's left is stacking them high on a plate and piling them with your favorite toppings my personal preference them in some maple syrup I just watch it dribble down the sides that is what I call a stack of good pancakes I also like to add some fresh berries I'm using blueberries and some frozen raspberries because that was all those available serve them also with some butter that's the best before digging in these pancakes take no more than 5 to 10 minutes to put together they're really quick to make the really simple and they're so soft cinnamon and oats always go perfect together especially when you're doing oatmeal these taste amazing with fruits and of course you want to put on some maple syrup and some butter I hope you enjoyed this recipe for a soft fluffy pancakes if you do don't forget to post a photograph on my social media links in the description down below as always you can find the recipe on hot chocolate it's calm don't forget to rate comment and subscribe and I will see you next time goodbye [Music] you [Music]
