 hi guys I'm welcome to cooking with karma now on Monday I showed you how to make those absolutely scrumptious onion rings and today we're going to make some equally scrumptious hash browns now we're not going to deep-fry them we're going to pan fry them and throw in some sweet potatoes some onions and a bit of spice so I really hope you enjoy this one let's get started and I'll show you just how to make them so the first thing we're going to do is partially boil our potatoes now about 5 to 7 minutes should do it while they're doing their thing into a pan with a little bit of oil we're going to cook up some onions now we're going to cook the onions for about the same time as the potatoes until they're nice and soft and they develop just a touch of color then we're going to give them another quick chop until they're nice and fine once our potatoes have been drained and cooled it's time to grate them up once they're all grated we're going to add our potato and the onion into a bowl we're going to season it with some pepper a little touch of chili powder and some garlic salt then we're just going to give everything a good mix until it's well combined then we're going to place our mixture into the fridge for about 20 minutes till it firms up then it's simply putting them together into the shape of the hash brown and popping them into a pan with some oil now depending on how you like your grease factor you can either do like a shallow fry or you don't need to use much oil at all they turn out great either way so on a medium to high heat we're just going to cook these on either side until they're golden brown crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside that nice little hint of spice these are a great addition to any breakfast YUM really simple and really tasty and of course if you're not have found a sweet potato you can leave that out altogether and feel free to use whichever herbs and spices that you like but I really hope you give that recipe a go thanks again for joining me have a wonderful weekend and I'll see you all on Monday
