 hello my name is Sammy and today we'll be making a shrimp and scallop shish kebabs a few ingredients or to be using is the Worchester sauce some garlic powder some butter some paprika some lemons to make the marination sauce they know we will be using scallops and shrimp make sure you devein the shrimp and kill the shrimp and if they are frozen keep them in the fridge overnight so that they defrost also it'll be cheese sticks I like to call them Irish Spears um you put them in the water overnight and so they don't burn on the grill while you're cooking their stuff now first we're going to make the marination sauce and first you're going to put in a half a cup of butter right in the bowl later then we're going to put in 7 tablespoons of lemon juice freshly squeezed and then we're going to put in 5 tablespoons of fish sauce there we go very nice and then we're gonna put about 2 dashes of garlic salt you know if you like more salt you can go ahead and add that and about 1 National Park paprika and the dash once you mix it you're going to put it in the microwave for about until the butter is melted maybe a minute minute and a half take about one third of the mix and set it aside for basting whether shish kebabs on the grill then you're going to put these scallops and the shrimp in a sealable bag so that they can marinate in there by themselves so you're just going to lift them all and put them in there and when you marinate them that you have to set them aside and mix them for about an hour when you set them aside for about an hour and then mix mix them and set them aside for about an hour and there we go you're going to Florida mix inside the bag don't spill around after about an hour you take them out of the fridge and then it's time to Irish spear them the favorite part and start with a lemon wedge first but that's right on there and then you're going to alternate the shrimp and these scallops so you get some nice and even so you're just going to feel thinner than the whole hog on up and that's about enough right should we add one more we'll add one more shrimp all right how should people now you want to make sure to this don't put them too close together is if you put them too close together they don't cook all the way around now the reason we put lemon wedges on them is that when they're done cooking you're going to stir them up on the grill while they're hot and then you're going to squeeze the lemon edge so that the truth runs down the whole stick all right that gives them the last-minute flavor at them enough of that well uncovered over medium hot heat for about six minutes opening once brush with reserved marinade the one we set aside earlier real eight to ten minutes longer until turn pink and I hope you enjoyed their shrimp and scallop Shabab
