 [Music] here's a recipe for chili lime chicken kebabs from Allrecipes member Simic Allrecipes member RC Kim comments these kebabs were a huge hit at our barbecue everyone raved the blend of citrus and spices was wonderful first cut 1 pound of skinless boneless chicken breast halves into one and a half inch pieces [Music] place the chicken in a shallow baking dish [Music] next make the marinade into a small bowl add three tablespoons of olive oil and one and a half tablespoons of red wine vinegar using a reamer or a fork juice one lime adding the lime juice to the bowl whisk the juice together with the oil and vinegar add one teaspoon of chili powder half a teaspoon of paprika 1/2 a teaspoon of onion powder half a teaspoon of garlic powder cayenne pepper to taste and salt and ground black pepper to taste [Music] whisk the seasonings into the marinade of course you can cut up some vegetables too like onions peppers mushrooms or whatever you like and marinate them along with the chicken to thread later on the kabobs pour the marinade over the chicken and vegetables and stir to make sure everything is well coated [Music] cover the dish and refrigerate for at least one hour the chicken will benefit from marinating longer if you have time but because of lime juice and vinegar and the marinade we wouldn't recommend marinating it for more than four to five hours when you're ready to cook the chicken preheat the grill from medium-high heat thread the chicken and peppers onto skewers if you're using wooden skewers it's a good idea to soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning on the grill [Music] discard the marinade lightly oil the grill grate grill the skewers turning occasionally until the chicken juices run clear for 10 to 15 minutes [Music] an Allrecipes member who goes by daybreak five notes I've made these chili lime chicken kebabs so many times I've lost count great on the barbecue or if it's too cold outside I broiled them [Music]
