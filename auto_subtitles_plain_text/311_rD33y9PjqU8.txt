 we're gonna do a very very traditional dish of Ireland and its colcannon and there's as many ways as there is mothers to make colcannon this is the way my grandmother made it for me you start with a warm pan with butter add some potato some cabbage some onion and traditionally they use kale but I had way too much kale growing up so I'm going to use leek seasoning let that cook just a little bit gonna add a wee bit of milk a little parsley to finish you
