 you I'm making Indian naan bread flatbread that's cold not very easy and I keep repeating every time I watch my videos I start by saying it's very easy very simple and it is I always go for fast quick and delicious tasting food and in general everything anyways we're gonna start making dough and we need some yogurt water and make sure that you've got this room temperature and water is warm and if the yogurt is cold just add hot water on it and it will become just the temperature we need just give it a quick mix some honey not too many ingredients honey all right and for that rice just mix it in to incorporate everything together and we need some salt one and a half tablespoon and always mix after adding ingredient of course it's a bright we need and I'm always using instant yeast for most of my breads because we don't have to activate it another quick mix and we can start adding our flour oh and I forgot the olive oil about 2 tablespoon or so I forgot an ingredient we can start adding in the flour and we need as much flour as it needs to become a soft but not sticky dough it should take probably three and a half four depending on what kind of yogurt you use you can I'm using full fat by the way and don't add three and a half cups of flour at once just add as you go if you need more when it's already starting to come together just start adding the flour little by little you don't wanna add extra flour and have Steve bread and I'm using regular all-purpose flour if you want you can also use whole wheat flour just substitute another crowd or just use instead of all-purpose use let's say 2 cups all-purpose when you have cup whole wheat again that's your preference this should be good to go on my meat on my surface so I can knead with my hands and when I'm done with the dough I'll come back and show you the rest my dog is ready and it will go into lightly greased roll for an hour just to make sure it doubles in size cover it with plastic or damp towel and let it and involvement place in your kitchen mine is my microwave and I already prepared another one earlier so I'm gonna use that straw to show you how I make my naan bread this one has been about two hours and it looks really ready doubled in size all those nice bubbles just like the spring cup your working surface with flour through me soft and mushy and I'm going to make eight eight bread you can make ten probably if you want to make smaller if you want to measure them or weight them with your kitchen scale that's fine I'm using my three scale which is this method I can already tell this is how much and this is very soft and mushy both so if it doesn't if it sticks just add some eight nine offs okay I made all right just be right this one into please wait with my skill this is they don't have to be perfectly sized and I don't even make them evenly shaped okay and you will take one and with your hands I don't even use a rolling pin for this bread I'm just gonna shape it as mom broke it which is half elongated or half round uneven but like very unique uniquely shaped flour bread it's like so and at this point you can start preheating your nonstick skillet because we're going to make this on on top of yeah but we're not baking this actually inside the oven we're making this on top of the oven just stretch and pull shape it if you want to use rolling pin to make them even the circle shaped it's up to you I never make that for my right this especially I mean I never use it okay I'll just continue and finish this and when I come back we'll continue baking alright everything is done it can now go to my already preheated skillet and it should be 375 to barely 400 degrees so you don't burn them and just like so crap one try one you don't have to have to like I'm doing now it's just to finish faster and then you bake pretty quickly so keep an eye I just lord and as they bake I will show you how I made my butter to brush them so let me just quickly take a look well it's not almost getting ready so quickly i melted some butter come on cameraman okay I have two tablespoons of butter I'm adding some curry probably less than a teaspoon oops if you like it spicy cayenne and some garlic this is enough and with your brush just quickly mix it and we're going to brush the bread with this curry sauce see how nice and bubbly they are it's time to try them on the other side so you get less time with him three minutes my breads are ready that's it I'm just gonna brush them with butter when they're done and that's it as simple as this and if you don't like butter with garlic or curry just leave it out it's an option of spice almost ready just watch them not to burn well within less than eight minutes my nuns are ready I'm just gonna quickly brush them with some God garlic butter and curry mix lightly drizzle them with partly finely chopped and then serve the water hot they are irresistible they smell so good that's it I hope you guys try it and I hope you join me for my next video and remember to subscribe thank you you
