 today I'm going to be showing you how to make Christmas pancakes the first thing is to make the batter I'm going to use just add water mix for this I don't usually measure the water I just keep adding until it's somewhere between thick and runny next I'm going to prepare these for my batter dispensers I'm going to cut the cap off and then cut this at an angle so the more batter can come out use a bowl that has a spout so that you can easily fill the containers now you want to prepare the stove by preheating it to a low to medium setting for Santa you are going to start with the nose then the mustache the face and the hat and then the beard and the eyes after letting it cook for a little while you're going to fill in the rest of the space check that it's cooked loosen it and what now it's ready to serve [Music] you and the last thing to you add some serum every [Music]
