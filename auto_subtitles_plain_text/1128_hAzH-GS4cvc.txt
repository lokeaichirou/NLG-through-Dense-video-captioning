 we love this stuff yeah and you make all that stuff because it's for the food our master and me let's make a song about food oh you're the master hey hey hey hey hey you got in my room what we're making today is food on a Japanese noodle dish that we're going to prepare warm and put our own toppings in it this is actually fresh and healthy and the great thing about this dish it literally takes just a couple minutes to put together and the toppings that we use are ones that you have in your refrigerator and the broth is a concentrated base noodle sauce called sit suits about TSU why you and you can find it online or at Asian grocery store so the noodles that I bought come in a five pack of these single block frozen noodle noodles so what we're going to do is we're just going to go ahead and put this in and I'm going to put two so it's enough food to feed the boys in myself so we're going to boil these noodles just for a couple minutes now with the sauce you could use the concentrated sits and sauce on itself the ratio is about 8 cups of water to one portion of sit zoom you can also increase the depth and flavor and the Maumee of the sauce by adding just a couple coins of ginger and a little bit of soy sauce and some sesame oil and some mirin which is a sweet Japanese seasoning but a lot of these sauces can be found at your local Asian grocery store and surprisingly more supermarkets are carrying these types of things in there Asian food sections once that comes to a boil you can turn off it doesn't really need to do anything else and the noodles only take a couple minutes and you basically want to cook them until they're unthawed that you don't want to overcook it and you have mush you want chewy noodles and now we're going to go ahead and strain them now some people might wonder why do we not cook the noodles in the broth it's because you want this pure noodle flavor and the broth serves its own purposes we want nothing to influence the broth now the great thing about this broth that we have going on here you can serve it plain with the noodles however if you have anything like broccoli or protein that's uncooked that needs to be cooked a little piece of my my fish this is the time where we throw it into the broth and let it cook for about a minute you just want to cook the ingredients until it's just barely cooked Wow I think I mean I might marry she was still alive anyway you might marry me if I'm still alive that's like the nicest thing anybody has ever said yeah what's the way to a man's heart uh I forget a weight on me as heart is ood oh yeah right yeah everybody there's some food a coffee which is some seasoned nori assessments it's a very popular condiment that's gonna be mine right I want a pink Chuck yeah the pink one okay there you go good job you make the glist who don't ever how Elliot coming from you that's like the ultimate compliment thank you it's your secret spy thing so good lunch when there's silence delicious get the full recipe from today's episode on PBS parents kitchen explorers and don't forget
