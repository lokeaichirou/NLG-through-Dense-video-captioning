 gotta love the classics Waldorf salad included it's one of my favorites but I'm always looking for ways to sort of lighten things up make them a little bit more clean and healthy so we are going to sort of revisit the dressing on a classic Waldorf salad we're going to start with seriously reducing the mayonnaise that's step one so use 1/4 cup mayonnaise and this dressing will make about one cup so this is really great just to have on hand throughout the week it's kind of like a really simple homemade ranch dressing if you're in Turin Mike I am 3/4 cup buttermilk love using buttermilk and dressings because it adds a really nice tangy creamy texture about a tablespoon of lemon juice and then we have a tablespoon each of chopped chives this is where I think the ranch flavor sort of comes in and chopped parsley you could really use any soft tender herb you happen to have salt and pepper very important here and this is just great to go in the fridge salads use it as a dip with fresh vegetables very versatile it'll thicken up a little bit as it chills in the frigerator mmm okay so dressing is done let's assemble the salad so Waldorf salad classically is a lot of mayonnaise and then a lot of celery apples traditionally walnuts I'm going to use almonds today and chicken so we'll shoot for about half of an apple here the apple adds a really nice sweet fresh hit nice color good amount of fiber think forks size we have everything here so let's assemble our salad I'm gonna use Bibb lettuce which is one of my favorites it's a really nice tender sort of sweet neutral lettuce nice amount of crunch rich in dietary fiber and then we'll add a good handful of fresh chopped apples celery love the celery again for its nice sweet fresh flavor but also really nice crunch factor here now I have some grilled chicken add a few slices of that this will give us that protein boost we need and of course some crunchy nuts traditionally the salad was made using walnuts I really really love the flavor of toasted almonds with chicken especially apples seasoned everything with salt and pepper alright let's get dressed super colorful always looking for that in not only just salads but everything that we try to make here on eat clean looks delicious right let's try mmm super crunchy fresh tasty who doesn't love a salad
