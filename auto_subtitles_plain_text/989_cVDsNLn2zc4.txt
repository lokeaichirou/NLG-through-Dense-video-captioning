 well it's the holiday season and for a special occasion I love foie gras this is a foie gras it's a giant overstuffed fat liver of a duck or a goose in this case it's a duck it's from Canada because the Peter nuts have made it so it's very difficult to grow these in the States and by the way if you're a peanut nut you can just switch off right now I love this stuff I don't care what anyone thinks I'm going to eat it occasionally this is about a two-pound lobe it's about 100 bucks worth of liver it doesn't taste at all like liver basically it's meat flavored butter if you were to cook this in an oven slowly all the fat would drain out of it and you'd end up with a piece about the size of a grape because it's almost all fat there's very little work to do on one of these things you can see pretty clearly it comes in two pieces so you can break the pieces apart or you can just slice it straight across if you slice across that's great they may fall apart and if you want one very even piece you may find you want to slice it lengthwise I'm going to do a sort of a combination of both by slicing it sort of diagonally along with the crease that's in here so that if in case the pieces do sort of fall apart there's minimal waste it did cost as I said about $100 it's about 50 bucks a pound however you're going to get a good 12 to 16 servings out of this thing so it's not exactly what you would call economical but it's not that hard stopping the expensive either ah the best way to cut is to use a long thin knife like a carving knife and wash it in hot water between cuts the hot blade of the knife will cut right through it like butter and make very nice clean cuts so I'm going to fill up a picture and use that to warm up my neck we made four portions of this appetizer one of these giant flaws would obviously make a lot more than that the other thing to remember is we're going to use all the fat that comes off this to cook everything else so we're doing it in a skillet we're not going throw any of the fat away but nice slice about a quarter of an inch thick foie gras experts out there will tell you you need to clean the nerves and veins out of this thing I think that's completely unnecessary in a waste of time and will actually ruin the way the foie gras looks because you're going to tear it up into pieces so I have four very nice slices here these don't need very much seasoning except for just a little salt and pepper I wouldn't put very much I will sprinkle a little bit of my seasoned salt blend and my seasoned pepper not much that's that now also we have some very thinly sliced shallots here shallots are like little red onions they're sort of a cross between a red onion and a garlic they had a great flavor if you didn't have shallots you could use red onion best way to peel a shallot kind of lengthwise because it's sometimes there in a figure 8 shape and pull the entire outer layer off and remember you're not wasting that because you're gonna use it for your soup stock because we've talked about many times and I like the phone I'm sauteing them I like to cut them lengthwise does it really matter probably not slicing them fin okay couple more pieces to this and once all the pieces are ready we'll get cooking we're going to put some apple we're going to sautee some apple nice thin slices of apple this is a fairly crisp firm textured apple that has a mixture of tart and sweet this kind is called Fuji you may have a different kind available where you live use whatever you like you want your pan hot but not screeching hot because you could burn the flop or overcook it and when you overcook it it will melt down to nothing foie gras goes in first you can see the fat comes starts coming out immediately maybe 30 seconds of on a side is all it needs can see just an unbelievable amount of fat coming out we're going to use that to our advantage so you can see the color is just golden brown it's not black it's not deep brown we're gonna remove these to a plate whatever you do do not drain these on paper towels because then all the juice and all the fat will go into the paper towel and you won't be able to eat it now into the fat we grill our bread on both sides just getting the bread nice and toasty okay breads nice and crispy onto a plate and then go the shallots keep them moving so they don't burn and although you want to turn the fire up don't if you want you can add a little touch of salt and a little pepper to the onions shout again these seasoning mixes are available on the web the recipes are on the website if you don't want to make them yourself usually happy to sell some people shallots are starting to get nicely brown they're not quite finished yet so we'll move them off to the side and put in our apples all right just till the apples get soft a little bit of color on them I think we're ready to assemble so onto the plate lovely piece of toast some of the shallots nice piece of foie fantastic little piece of apple pick this up and eat it with your hands or eat it with a knife and fork but however you need it a fantastic special holiday appetizer well gras on baguettes with shallots and apples
