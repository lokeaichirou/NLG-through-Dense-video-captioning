 hey guys thanks for stopping by ballistic BBQ another edition of grand theft burger today's victim Fuddruckers the hangover burger let's get going alright so one of the things that makes Fuddruckers such a good burger is simply the meat they grind their meat in-house which is what I did I got a really good deal on some decent ribeye and makes the best hamburgers it's one of my favorite meats and the price I paid for these it was about the same as I would have paid for her sirloin or chuck so can't beat it really good marbling you want some nice fat content in a good hamburger now Fuddruckers they sell their burgers in 1/4 1/3 and 1/2 pound sizes I'm not going to weigh mine but I'm probably going to go for right around 1/3 meat between 1/3 and 1/2 now they're patties are perfectly shaped there's nothing your regular about the shape at all which is why I'm using this form here when I try to come as close as I can to the way their burgers look now I am obviously packing this but I'm paying close attention I'm not packing it too hard and there we go looks like a flight director patty I'm pretty happy with this we're going to go ahead and set this aside and move on to the next step which is they're seasoning salt all right now Fuddruckers seasons their patties with the seasoning salt that they actually brand it's pretty good stuff and I found a really good copycat recipe on top secret recipes calm thank you guys so we're going to start off with 2 teaspoons of paprika one and a half teaspoons black pepper one and a quarter teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper it's going to give that a good mix and there we go good stop girls almost ready so meet you out on the pad alright guys so Fuddruckers cooks their burgers on a flattop we're going to be using the Mojoe griddle today love cooking on this thing it really replicates the type of cooking surface that you get in those restaurants seasoned up patty with that seasoning salt we made let's get it down here going tot now this hangover burger has bacon on it so we're going to go ahead and start crisping up some bacon right dick is looking pretty good we're going to go ahead and take this off set aside all right soon as you can see I'm getting some nice color up the side of this burger we're going to go ahead and flip it gorgeous crust so go ahead and put on some cheddar cheese all right that's what I'm looking for now what I'm going to do is move this burger up to the cooler side here and we're going to do something that again defines this burger this hangover burger now so you guys know I only have charcoal on one side of my grill on this half the grill this side is strictly radiant heat which is what I want is you see in a minute here they have a fried egg on top of this burger little water now the buns are also another signature thing for side wreckers they take their own bonds I have some buns here I actually bought at Fuddruckers right here we're going to give these just a little bit of a toast eggs coming along fine I'm going to go ahead and give this a flip gorgeous toast on the bread right guys eggs done burgers done let's go ahead and make us a hangover burger right now when you buy a burger at Fuddruckers even one of their signature burgers they have this unbelievable produce bar where you can build the burger how you want it different types of lettuce tomatoes salsas you name it onion good stuff so this is one of their signature burgers the hangover burger but it doesn't come with any lettuce or tomato or anything on it so I'm going to go ahead and do it as I would do at the restaurant and I'll lay down some nice green leaf lettuce a couple thin slices of tomato then that burger is going to go down and the slices bacon in that egg on top now of course you have the options of mustard ketchup barbecue sauce or whatever the preferred condiment for the hangover burger is good old a one steak sauce that's the way I like to have it top it with that beautiful fresh-baked bun there you go guys let's give this a shot this is going to be yet another messy one and tell you that right now so good guys that steak sauce just really does the beef well and that egg I didn't really used to be into eggs on burgers until just recently love them anyway guys thanks for stopping by keep the suggestions coming see you on the next video Cheers
