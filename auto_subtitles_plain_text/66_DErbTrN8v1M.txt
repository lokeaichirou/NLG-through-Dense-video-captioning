 hi everybody welcome to the moms ooh I'm excited because I never do cooking videos I love cooking videos I'm excited because Colette's cooking in my house I don't really get used to this like you can come over at any time we really should dinner well actually because whenever we come over Casey's cooking something really awesome like elk but today we are having a vegetarian dish so I've made these sweet potato black bean burritos before on the Shaytards blog but I've never actually shown the recipe so this is where you get to see how they are made and you can choose to make them yourself these are actually vegan but you can we sometimes put cheese in them and make them non vegan that's a vegetarian still vegetarian but you can also put meat in them if you want to because they would be good with me as well so they're so good and like hearty that you don't miss the meat in them because of the beans and then the sweet potatoes and there's just so much goodness in there I think the hard thing sometimes was going vegetarian is just the texture of me not getting that texture but there's this burrito is definitely substantial and my family loves it so let's start okay so what are we going to need for this recipe okay we're gonna start with sweet potatoes and you can either do like three large ones or four to five small ones and I just had one that was on pill just in case you don't know just you could it looks like cuz sometimes you don't you know I'm always confused too so you do you always use like the yams the orange ones or do you ever use like the white sweet potatoes I usually use the orange ones but I think you can use whatever comes you want really it doesn't matter but these are the ones that I always use in this recipe because they look prettier they do look really pretty yeah you're going to need black beans you can either soak them yourself or get canned ones cuz that's what I do and I like doing that because it's fast and I always drain them I used about three cans of black beans and that will be enough to make a big pot for our whole family like a big tray for a whole family but if you have guests over you might want more than that so three cans of black beans one large onion for about four cloves of garlic more and more salt and pepper to taste brown sugar if you want to add sugar you don't have to put the brown sugar and of course I just like the taste of it did soy sauce one tablespoon and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce if you don't have one or the other you can always substitute two tablespoons of whichever one you have a tablespoon of olive oil 3 tablespoons of chili powder 2 tablespoons of cumin this is a little bit less because I didn't have any more cumin in myself and I was like thinking I forgot to ask you but that's ok you know and then a tablespoon of mustard in a tablespoon of ketchup I love adding sweet to recipes like this because there are so many spicy things and savory things that it's good to like bring out more of the sweet potato so that's why brown sugar is always great tattoo recipes like this I think and that's why I added it into this recipe cuz I am a sweet person some people are more like salty spicy but I love I love it all give it all to me this has everything that you would ever want yes and I did leave out the hot sauce but you can add any kind of hot sauce that you like to this but when I make it for my kids I usually leave that part out ok so what are we going to do first we're going to cut up our potatoes and start them boiling and then we'll put all the stuff in the beans and start that so it's kind of a potato so how long does it usually take to a boil the sweet potatoes the potatoes only take about 10 minutes to soften and then mash them and then I put them to the side but the beans will take about 20 minutes so you know any time in between there if you want to start the beans first and then do the potatoes I always like to start him first for some reason okay so I am really happy that I have a partner in crime today because normally I do all this by myself or I have one of the kids help but I don't normally let them cut because it scares me my dog is really scary right alright so she's gonna cut up the potatoes and get those started while I show you guys how to mix all the beans normally I do this on the stovetop but we're yeah we just want to show you right here because it's easier so I'll start with the olive oil and I'll put that in the pan first and that does not take very long to heat up and you don't want to let all Avoyelles sit on the stovetop getting hot because it gets too hot and it burns and it pops at you and it's messy so don't let that get too hot before you put your onions on so you're gonna put your onions on normally you let them saute it for a little bit maybe about two minutes and and just so you know it's okay to add everything at once and then start it like it doesn't matter how you do it this is just the order that I usually do it in so you can just however works for you you do it that way then you're gonna put the beans in and at this point the pan is gonna be a little bit dry so then you're gonna put half of the water in I guess I didn't show that part of the game you're gonna have a cup and a half of water okay so you're going to put maybe half the water in and you're gonna let that cook together for a little bit and while the beans are cooking you want to make sure that you're mashing while you're cooking them and then you can just add all your stuff so the sugar and like all of this stuff it doesn't matter at all when you put it in how much you put in if you like try it you decide you know what babe I'll put more soy sauce or less chili powder or whatever like you can decide I'm all about that with recipes like I always get recipes online and then I just changed them up so much like I'm like you know what that's not working for me so feel free to do it however you want and I sometimes put the garlic in with the onions but sometimes they take me so long to chop up that I end up just putting them in at the end okay and then salt and pepper to taste just however much you want okay then you're going to mix that up mash it up let it simmer for about 10 minutes mash it up some more let it simmer watch them make sure they don't get too dry add water in mash them until they're kind of a nice smooth like refried green text and I don't match them up until they're totally smooth there's always going to be some chunks of beans in there and that's totally fine so we're gonna let that cook for a minute and then boil these boil and we'll be right back and we'll probably eat some chocolate in between cuz that's fun all right so we've cooked the potatoes and we've mashed them I didn't add anything to the potatoes we just cut him up put him in the pot let him boil for about 10-15 minutes and then mashed him up right in the water first strain don't leave thank you I forget the little thing you know it's little things that like I don't cook so if someone doesn't say that then I would be like me with the water so you got your potatoes and then the beans I ended up having to add a little bit more water while it was cooking them so just keep that in mind depending on this is really weird I didn't know about cooking but depending on your elevation oh you need to add more water cuz it's we're in a dry climate and we're up higher up the so it sucks the water out quicker so I had to add more water but I noticed in California I when I put a cup and a half it was too much so depending on where you live just kind of watch the water alright so we have the beans are all mashed up and cooked potatoes and we're just going to put them together I usually put the sweet potato on the bottom and just depending on how much you want to put on there I just put like a little dollop I'm gonna double up on top of those depends on how big your tortillas are how big you want the burritos so big but kind of just an even amount of both okay there we go that is beautiful okay and then I always fold the ends in first and then wrap one side and tuck it and then roll it that way when you're eating you don't have stuff falling out the ends so and then we're just putting them in a baking dish if you don't want to keep them vegetarian or vegan you can put cheese on them at this point and I usually put cheese on the inside and then I put cheese on the outside as well because Jesus fun and this is the this is where you would add me to it yes add any kind of meat you'll want to already cooked though for sure like so cook your meat and then add it into the burrito now you put them in the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes just to make the tortillas a little bit crispy alright they're all finished and we just left them in for about 1215 minutes so they're all crispy and awesome now so good they do smell good right so you want to make sure they're cool before you get them out of the pan and if I'm serving them to my kids I'll always kind of in half like that because I have some cool off faster but yeah and then you can put sour cream or off kados or guacamole or like anything salts like you can add anything to it yep so you're ready to try it yes okay so ready so good mm-hmm so good yeah I think it's good let's add some cheese to it next time yeah but they're really good without cheese - mm-hmm so such a yummy healthy dish okay let us know if you try it let us know if you want to see more recipes on the moms view I like cooking together I
