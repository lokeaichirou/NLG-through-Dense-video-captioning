 hey you guys it's Nikki Anna coming it's yet again today and I'm coming at you with part two of my cooking that I'm doing today and as I stated in the other video a lot of my newbies don't know that mama throws down actually that's one of the main things I do in YouTube so I'm not you probably only know me for couponing but yeah I make mills on a budget feeding anywhere between four to eight people ten dollars or under and if you go back on my 600 videos that I have and seven months I know kind of ridiculous but if you go up a cup my videos you will actually see that that's what I did and that's what I've been doing and do all new I have a cookbook coming out every year so are you guys what we're fixing today is some chicken I'm fixing some stuffing stuffed some stuffed chicken breast boneless chicken breast and skinless so we're gonna fix that we're gonna pound that out and stuff it with the stuffing inside and all that good stuff we're gonna fix some mac and cheese with heavy cream and that's one of my recipes that I fix everybody loves it so hopefully you'll be able to try it as well I'm trying to get my lighting right you guys I know it's quite a glare because it's facing the window but uh please bear with me so right now I'm just fixing the mac and cheese already showed you how to what to use and right now we're just want to dice up our cheese already put one in there and I'm going to pan down and talk to you that way so you can see what I'm going all righty so as you can see it's already creamy and actually the cheese has not melted or anything that's simply because I added the heavy cream and you definitely want to add heavy cream it's not the most healthy but it's definitely a great way to fix it that's going to change the whole taste on what you're what you're fixing so you definitely want to put heavy cleaning in there slide for Easter dinner or whatever just going slice off and for mine I use one pound of noodles or one and a half pounds like this is one and a half pounds and I use three packs of the crack rocket barrel cheese I already put three eggs and and I showed you how much heavy cream to use and the other video which is one paint so what I do is I cut it up is that a package okay and I just got a package in the mail you guys for a review that VH pods nice wants me to do and I will be going that review as soon as I need a chance I have a couple reviews so companies wanted me to do so I haven't been doing them I also have some things in the work with being on a few people's website as a as a would they call it I'm sorry you guys I'm all over the place today please bear with me mama be having so much going on y'all be like thinking I juggle so much but I juggle so much trust me all day long I really don't know it anyhow I've done it but I know how because God gives me a supernatural power and supernatural strength and that's why I'm able to do it um but yeah I have a couple of things in the works I have a column on the Virgo gems calm that um they hired me to do I also have some other things in the works I can't really talk too much about it that's what I'm trying to dance around it but it's a couple of companies that has hired me to or potentially will be hiring me to do a couple of things so we shall see I'll take whatever God sends my way if it's time now anyway I've already done two of the as you can see I've already done two of the cheese's and although I put the heavy cream in that's for the creaminess but for it to make sure it doesn't be dry what you're going to add is a pan of fat milk I'm also fixing some mashed potatoes with gravy this is just to make sure because you got to remember the noodles are going to absorb okay so you know you don't want dry mac and cheese so that was a can of evaporated milk the seasons that you're going to put in it you don't want to try to change I will try to mess with mac and cheese too much as more of a classic dish so you're just gonna add your to your regular seasonings you're gonna add your shirt a little bit of salt and pepper if you have fresh ground pepper better be great you use less of that of course because it's more stronger more potent and then you're gonna add a little bit of put on paprika back in once you already put it into your baking dish okay roll cooks by the seasonings be all righty I'm just gonna stir this all up and I'm gonna go ahead and put this in my baking dish but I'm also going to add some more cheese on top once it's already in the baking dish and that's the last pack of cheese now I'd like to use these little pans because you can get them from the Dollar Tree or a dollar store they come they're hard they're reusable and it's great to use because I could just like for instance we're gonna probably eat this little pan today yeah we probably will but then I can have us a pan set aside for another dish and I could just freeze it so alrighty so we're just gonna add we're just gonna add yeah so this will fill up two of those pans as I just showed you then we're gonna add like I said some more cheese on top okay so let's do one at a time clean up your space as you go along and keep your all righty so this is how it looks then we're just gonna cut up some more of that cheese you guys yes more when you're dealing with mac and cheese more is better I don't care what nobody said I can't stand the taste some dry mac and cheese when you could tell people been trying to skimp on the cheese because they didn't get enough of it I hate it so this is going to take Ford to get nice and cheesy and clean it's gonna take probably like I said about three okay next video is gonna be of my stuffing I've already saut√©ed my vegetables foodie get out the kitchen and just add this on top make sure you reserve half of that block of cheese for the next dish that you're gonna fill the next pan and then you can reserve that and you can kill two birds with one stone ladies that's how you be efficient with your time because you reserved it and then that you already have it frozen for the next time why spend money on frozen Stouffer's and things like that aren't raised when you can fix your own for move way way less than the price they charge tastes much better and you know exactly what you put in it so what we're going to do is add all that breakup on top and this is Kiana's homemade mac and cheese with heavy cream I love you all so much I thank you all for watching a comedy and subbing of course love you all the best
