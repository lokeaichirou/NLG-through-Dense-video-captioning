 are you looking from over the top burger experience if you are you've come to the right place today I'm making a blue cheese stuffed burger with a red pepper mayonnaise sauce sort of like special sauce but with red peppers it's really delicious I'll get to that in a few minutes but first I'm making my burger mix I'm dividing a piece of blue cheese into 8 pieces this could be any kind of cheese that you want brie would work cheddar would work etc etc so I've divided my blue cheese into 8 pieces you may notice I'm wearing gloves I'm just doing that because blue cheese does have kind of a strong scent and if you are concerned about that on your hands wear a pair of gloves also I'm going to be touching meat and then I won't have to wash my hands here I have 3 pounds of meat it's ground chuck to that I'm going to add a tablespoon of coarse salt if you're using fine salt or if you're using a particularly salty brand of coarse salt use a teaspoon and a half to 2 teaspoons also going to season the meat with a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper normally when I'm making burgers I don't season the meat at all except for with salt and pepper as I'm cooking it so this one's a little bit special because I actually am putting flavoring right in the burger now add 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce world's hardest word to say very delicious great depth of flavor mommy what we're doing is giving our burgers a little bit of a steakhouse flavor because a 1 has a flavor that's sort of similar Worcestershire right so we're that's what we're doing with the blue cheese etc you get the rest 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons and then mix everything together you don't want to overwork your meat which is one of the reasons why I generally don't add seasonings to my burgers but sometimes it's just nice to have that flavor right inside right want to fancy it up sometimes this is your fancy but easy burger mix it all together make sure that all the seasonings are well distributed throughout your meat then divide your meat into 8 mounds this is enough for 8 burgers you want to make sure that they're sort evenly divided before you pack them into your burgers so do the dividing first once you're satisfied that your mixture is evenly divided between all your burgers what you want to do is just shape them into your burger shape and then make a well in the center which is where you're gonna add your blue cheese to make a little hole slash well and just take a piece of blue cheese and put it into the center tuck it in fold it over Pat it down no one will ever know make sure it's nice and well enclosed otherwise as you're cooking it the cheese could come out you might want to give people the choice of blue cheese and cheddar or mozzarella so make a variety of different cheeses and then offer your friends and guests and family a choice if you want to make these ahead just keep them in a single layer on a baking sheet cover with plastic in the refrigerator you can do it in the morning probably do it the day ahead I've never done that but you could definitely do it the morning ahead a nice firm chilled burgers are really easy to grill excellent all done gloves off to the grill make sure that your grill is preheated nice and hot nice and clean and give it a little brush with oil just for safety's sake there's quite a bit of fat in ground chuck but you never know to us be safe be careful you can see I'm brushing with a handheld piece of paper towel maybe not the best idea but hey I'm a crazy girl place the burgers on the grill you don't need to season them they're already seasoned so don't worry about that and cook them about four to six minutes per side while your burgers are cooking you can get your special sauce ready my left a special sauce maybe not I don't know I don't care I said it anyway you can make your sauce right here in this food processor a cup of mayonnaise might work fine a quarter cup of chopped roasted red peppers half a teaspoon of white wine vinegar basically like a little more than a splash of white wine vinegar and about an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper freshly ground if you have it regular old pepper if you don't and then just process that up just until it combined and that's it that's all there is to the sauce here ultra special extra fancy and yet very easy burger it's time to flip the burgers now so let me go over there get rid of this I don't need it anymore time to flip when they're ready to flip they should be nice and charred and easy to lift off of the grill if you try to flip them too soon they'll fix don't go too early I feel like I've completely mastered the art of hamburger flipping our tongs a better tool is a spatula a better tool I don't know maybe I should try calm oh yeah it's better seems to be clean though make sure you have clean ones not the ones that use rami all right three to four more minutes under slicing Tomatoes up slice up a tomato or two make sure your knife is nice and sharp serrated knives also work really well for tomatoes spread some of your homemade special sauce on one side of the fun and then if you want a little bit of mustard why not combination of spicy and a little bit sweet really nice I mean obviously use whatever condiments appeal to you this is just this is where I'm going today guys slice of tomato these are so big you really only need one don't they look like flowers you're so cute and then a little bit of greens I'm using baby spinach today but obviously use whatever you have on hand or whatever appeals to you this is to continue your Steakhouse theme of the blue cheese and the spinach and how you get creamed spinach at steak house and now you're all ready all you have to do is get your burgers off the grill and I think mine are ready one burger yummy cheese stuffers are good all right top them off that is you think how crazily delicious that look look at that those are so deluxe Oh fantastic and
