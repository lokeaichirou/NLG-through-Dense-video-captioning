 hi I'm Stephanie jerski of joy baking calm today we're going to make buttermilk pancakes these are really easy to make you don't need an electric mixer all you need is two bowls one for the dry ingredients one for the wet and then you just mix the two together and you're done so we'll start with the dry ingredients in a large bowl I have put one cup that's a hundred and thirty grams of white all-purpose flour and the flour will give us the structure to the pancakes and to that I'm going to add one teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda and this will give us light airy pancake the leavener and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt that's the flavor and 2 tablespoons of that's 30 grams of white granulated sugar and the sugar not only adds sweetness to the pancakes but it also gives a makes them moist and it helps with the Browning so I'm just going to use a wire whisk or you just use a rubber spatula and just stir everything together you want to make sure there's no lumps and everything's blended okay and that's it for the dry and then for the wet try to have everything at room temperature so take one large egg and I'm just going to whisk that now the egg gives a nice richness to the batter it binds everything together and plus it helps with the Browning and then to that I'm going to add three tablespoons it's about 40 grams of butter that I've melted and then let cool to room temperature and your butter adds moistness and gives it a nice tenderness and plus of course some flavor that in and last is one cup that's 240 milliliters of buttermilk and buttermilk makes as opposed to milk it makes your pancakes more tender a little softer now I've used like a commercially made buttermilk you can make your own by just taking a cup of regular milk and adding like a teaspoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to it and just let it stand for 10 minutes or you could use just have this product on hand I usually have it in the fridge buttermilk pout powder and then you can just you don't have to worry about running out to the store just have it on hand it tells you on the back of the container how to use it so that's our wet ingredients so just make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and then add all your wet into the center there now we want to use a light hand when we're mixing this because you don't want a tough pancake so we don't want to mix it over mix it just enough I will mix it enough so that all the ingredients are blended together and when you're just stir gently and a few lumps is fine in a pancake batter now I'm using just a rubber spatula you could also use a wooden spoon and just gently stir these have a little more spongy texture then there's a regular pancake recipe on the site they uses milk and the difference is this is a little more spongy and light both are good of course the buttermilk adds a little bit of Tang okay so that's it and we're done so now to cook your pancakes I'm using an electric skillet if you have one of these turn your dial to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius if you don't have this just you can just use a frying pan on the stove try to use a heavy pan with a at surface you don't want any warps in your pan because then you get uneven cooking which we don't want and if you're doing on the stove set your heat to medium medium-high and what you can tell your pan is ready when you just take a little bit of water on your hands and just drop it on and it kind of splatter and that's when you know it's hot enough so if you have to adjust your heat to get it the right temperature and you might even have to adjust your heat as you're cooking the pancake if it's if it's cooking too fast or too slowly you can just kind of up or down now I'm going to just spray with a nonstick vegetable spray my skillet that kind of cuts down on your fat if you're worried about that it's nice and easy to do but you could use some oil or melted butter and you could either brush the oil or butter on with a pastry brush or with a piece of paper towel and then I'm going to use just a ladle of course you can make your pancakes as big or as small as you want if you don't want if you don't have a ladle you could just put this in a large measuring cup and then just pour it so I'm just going to and give your if you're going to put a lot of pancakes on your in your pan make sure you give enough room for spreading you can see this batter is really nice and thick from the buttermilk and I think depending on the buttermilk you buy some are thicker now the one I bought was really quite thick so then that's going to affect the consistency of the batter so I'm just um so we could now if you have a nonstick surface use a spatula not of stainless steel because you don't scratch your surface so you cook these until the tops you'll get lots of bubbles and when some of the bubbles start bursting then you'll know you could also just take your spatula and kind of just take a peek underneath because you want the bottom to be golden Brown and this will take maybe depending on your heat to three minutes so you can see the top they're starting to form some bubbles some of them are even popping so what you do is I always like to just put my spatula and just check and I can see that the bottom is golden brown so just take your and just flip of course the more you cook these the browner and some people like there's quite some light I kind of like the more the golden brown a little crisper and then just flip them and just cook the other side usually the second side doesn't take as long plus you will notice that the bottom side doesn't seem to brown quite as much as the top and that's normal okay so pancake done as you can see the second side you kind of it's not a solid brown it's kind of patchy that's how you want it and I have the platter here now I know the tendency is to kind of stack them but the problem with that is if you do that is the bottom ones tend to get soggy so we don't want that so try to have a platter or plate and then you can just space them flat like this now if you weren't going to serve these immediately you could put them in a hundred and seventy-five degree fahrenheit oven that's about 80 degrees Celsius and just put them right on top of your wire rack and they can stay there 15 20 minutes and so if I want to do another batch I would spray again and then just give your batter a stir now there's two ways if say you didn't want to make all of the pancakes you could just store this batter just cover it and store it in the fridge for usually like 24 hours and then just give it a real good stir of course not it's not going to be quite as good but it's still pretty good or you could just bake off all your pancakes and then just cool these and you could put them in the freezer and they'll last for about a month and then you could either reheat them in the oven just a moderate oven or you could just pop them right into your toaster oven so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm
