 chalk duty and thanks for tuning in to cooking with Nona today I have the pleasure of having no no Ann Marie and tell everybody where you're from I'm from Pescara Abruzzo so let's take a closer look and get to know our Nonna I grew up in Pescara in Abruzzo which is a region of Italy until I was 11 years old and then I came to this country in my family were four children three girls and a boy I learned that a cook when I was fifteen I was here in this country and my mother went to work so I was in charge of making one dish a night for my brothers and sisters very easy for me to learn how to cook because I like to eat anything I just enjoy making it I have two daughters and yes I did try to teach them boat that it cooked but one of them loves to the other one hates and she only likes to eat what do I like cooking yeah I guess its gratification I really don't know I just liked it from day one I always did as far as I can remember I liked cooking and we're back and we're going to start cooking so tell me what we're making Anna we're making pasta fagioli also and I like most people know what is pasta fazool when the stars make you drool just like pasta fazool I love it so what are we going to do to get started we're going to first up a our pancetta mm-hmm and with a little bit of olive oil now pasta fagioli is really pasta and beans and it's really more of a very thick soup and we're going to use cannellini beans today instead of borlotti beans because why because borlotti beans are only some beans they're fresh beans that you shell and cook and they're not available in the winter okay so our pancetta is going to start sauteing and what do you want me to do we are going to you can chop some celery and onion and tomato okay now we're going to make a base for our sauce and you can also do this all by hand but we're going to use our KitchenAid food today cut down on some time so you're just going to add about three stalks of celery these are just chops into pieces that fit and a medium onion and we're going to add some peeled tomatoes so we're going to put all that together and give a couple quick pulses stop all right here we go just going to add this to eventually okay so we got the base of our sauce going so what's next next we're going to add half of the beans and the beans are really special part of this dish and you can use dry kind of Leaney beans and soak them overnight and in the morning they will look like this but they take a little bit longer to cook so we're actually going to use some jarred kind of Leaney beans so we're going to add half of these beans and you can always use canned beans - there's nothing wrong with that whatever you have there you go so we got happy beans here what do we deal with these we're going to pureed them and put them put them into soup so that it makes a nice stick soup sounds like a plan and to do this we have our KitchenAid immersion blender this is a really cool tool because it cuts down on cleanup and you just whip it and then whip it out and here we go like a game looks good okay you say so and this is going to thicken our soup really nicely so how often do you make this I mean I know I'm not even from a Bootsie but my family ate this almost once a week in the wintertime at least the same the same with us it's a filling meal and it's a meal in itself you have all of your protein your vegetables are in here and your carbs so you really don't need anything else so what's next we're going to cook the pasta okay and we have some elbow pasta today and this isn't quite the traditional way you you would make it in Pescara what would you use we use homemade egg noodles cut into short strips or a two batiti pasta so we're just gonna put our pasta and get it going so our pastas in and what are we going to add to our we're going to add some hot water to make a soup here to get it ready to for the pasta so we have some hot water set aside you could certainly use some pasta water and if you use pasta water the starch that releases from the pasta will thicken your soup a little bit more so if you like a thicker pasta fagioli you can certainly do that we're going to just use some plain soup we're just going to use some plain water approximately a cup a cup and a half and why are we using hot water so that the vegetables don't get hard so how long does this have to cook well the soup probably a half hour depending which kind of beans you use if you use the dry beans that you soaked overnight it takes longer but it one ger yeah you'll probably need about an hour but if you use already cooked beans 20 minutes to a half hour is very good okay so this has been cooking for about 20 minutes and we are ready to add our pasta to it that we've only cooked halfway because they're going to finish cooking inside our kundalini soup okay drain the water and if it's not drained all the way it doesn't really matter and we're all set to go yeah we'll cook it for a few minutes till the pasta is done and it's all ready to serve oh this looks great already I can really smell all the different things we've added the celery the pancetta okay so this has been cooking for about five minutes we have everything together and we are ready to taste this well I am so oh this is great all those really nice chunks of pancetta so we're going to add just a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil I'll do crudo and make a nice little design because I'm five years old and we're ready ready let's give it a shot and see how good okay Vado hmm that is amazing the pancetta just makes it yellow spatulas delicious it's incredible thank you for teaching me how to make this finally thank you for being my number today thank you Wow and I have to clean your cheek knackles I gave you my lips ciao ciao Oh
