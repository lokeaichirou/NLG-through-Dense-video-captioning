 hey everybody how you doing is junk out here welcome to another episode of cooking with junkyard well today we are going back to our Asian roots why don't have any easy routes but if you're not just throw that in you have probably seen or if you have not you got to check out the junker cooking playlist where I made some sushi rolls california rolls now again I am NOT a chef in any way when it comes to any of this stuff I'm just a guy that loves to cook and love to share with you guys but what I'm thing I have been able to figure out is how to make some wonderful MLG spicy tuna roll so I forget I was going to go ahead and show you how to make those what help let's get started alright the ingredients are pretty basic we have ourselves a nice piece of sushi tuna we have some eggs we also have some japanese mayo and some japanese or asian style hot sauce it's called sororo sriracha hot sauce chili sauce some sesame seeds we have ourselves some seaweed go ahead and wrap it up in as well as we have ourselves some sushi rice okay first thing we want to go ahead and do is cut the tuna up so pretty much we're just going to go ahead and slice this up you want to slice it pretty much on the grains so it stays someone together but again with sushi rolls we're pretty much just chopping it up so it's all right all right yuval nice this was actually pre frozen flash frozen in the ocean is how they do it nowadays so as you can see we just got them in nice we don't want them too big but we don't want them too small either so we're just going to go ahead and slice this up all right put it all in a bowl then on top of that we're going to go ahead and add the fish roe fish eggs good scoop of that all right and we're going to add some of the hot sauce to make that spicy and remember this has a good bite to it so be ginger if you don't want to give it a lot we're going to add our mail then we're just going to pretty much stirred a hole up again the more hot sauce you add the spicy right yet Oh beautiful all right next the first couple things we need to do is get ourselves we have our clean cutting board here we have our bamboo ramp again this is something you could pick up at lots of grocery stores now but you can also pick this up at some an Asian specialty restaurant or an Asian specialty market and such as app now when you have your sushi wrap you actually have two different sizes you got a shiny side and a little bit duller side the dollar side is where you're going to go ahead and put your sticky rice or your AK sushi rice now I also have some water right here this is where you want to always go ahead and put your want to keep your hands moist alright and what we're going to do is I like to go ahead and rinse a little bit of the water off and you want to go ahead and then grab the sushi a nice big don't be shy going to grab a nice hunk o sushi now you need to go ahead and make sure your hands stay moist otherwise your hands will stick to the rice does not making it that well the easiest thing to work with here alright so what we're going to do is go ahead and lay the rice out pretty much all over the whole piece of seaweed and one thing you could always add things to this if you want I mean I'm just going to go ahead and just put the tuna roll in there but you could add if you want you could add avocados to it cucumbers all kinds of stuff but this professional we're just going to go ahead and just add the tuna so we got the rice right there then we're adding the tuna on it next just make a nice line right down the side there add some of the sesame seeds all right and then what we could do then what you do is you want to get it right to the edge of the bamboo sheet and then fold it over just like that see the way that folds over and then you got this you want to try to make sure you don't put the bamboo part of it right into the other part so then we pretty much just pull it tight and then you just roll it just like so and that's about it now you're going to get it's not going to always stick right here so if you need to add a little bit of moisture to it take advantage of that water and just roll it up a couple more times and there you go simple as that sushi rolls now so go ahead the next step is you want to go ahead and cut it up you want to get a real sharp knife now unfortunately my knives well I would love to say I have a real sharp knife but I don't my name is were getting pretty dull but this I mean it's doing it okay what you want to do though is always before you cut it you want to put the knife inside the water like so and then tap it so the water goes all the way down before you cut into the sushi all right pretty much and then you cut your sushi up like so then you just go ahead and lay it out real nicely on a sushi dish or a potted dish or a little dish whatever you have did dedham there you could add a little bit of garnish right here you got a little bit of wasabi right there a little bit of pickled ginger there you go fresh spicy tuna roll just going to give this a shot fresh spicy tuna roll simple Asian cuisine really tasty really flavorful very cost effective you realize you go out to the sushi restaurant and order this it'll cost ten bucks just for one I got enough here to make Oh quite a few and it cost me about ten bucks as far as ingredients ago and I'm
