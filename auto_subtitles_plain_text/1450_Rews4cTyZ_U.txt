 hello my name is Steve Ali I'm one of the chefs from taste x will school with food in ties will end all the I'm going to show you some recipes and some of the dishes that we do here I'm gonna show you how to make bangers and mash with most of mashed potato and onion agree one thing to remember when you when you're going to do a straightforward mashed potato it is your potatoes need to be cooked fairly evenly in size so they're all roughly the same size so I have to measure them but roughly the same size the other thing is with mashed potatoes you'll generally start them off in cold water if you're doing new potatoes you would normally start them off in boiling water so these are in cold water and they're going to just go on the salt not too much as although just dip at the end of it went up they're going to boil now for about about 20 minutes or so that's from boiling on a nice low heat and then working drain off and I'm ready for the mash we're now going to do some sausages we're going to pan fry the sausages finish them in the oven and they're going to be shared with our mashed potato and a nice gravy so the first thing is get your pan on the stove frying pan shut a little cooking oil to put a little bit of oil in the bottom some lovely local produce sausages we don't need to put the sausages anymore if you've got a good product you should be fine with that you can start them on fairly lowly where they'll need to make sure your winner pop them into the pan that they're going to actually sizzle not well know that is just about how much you know now I've just got a good colour but the need of it while I make some fried onions to finish up with some gravy meanwhile I've got some onion which I'm just going to slice potatoes are now cooked I've tried them with a fork and fork goes in nice and easy small knife if you want to meet full be nice unless they have a little bit of butcher in there so I'm going to put another a generous mother butcher in also a little bit of cream or milk what you want you don't feel the taste after you know there's some grain mustard just to give you that a little bit of a bite all right a little bit of grain mustard it's quite a mild monster so you can talk the Olympic Games I'm now going to add some brown gravy look at our grain mustard mash that's going to go just to the center our softer gears are nicely colored now in fact every she want to be give three nice sausages I think as a portion and there you've got bangers and mash with a mustard mash potato
