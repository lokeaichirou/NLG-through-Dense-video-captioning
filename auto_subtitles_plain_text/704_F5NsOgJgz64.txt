 hi everybody this is jino barber from Gino's trattoria in this video today I'll be showing you how we make our penne vodka at the restaurant I'll show you what ingredients we use right in front of us we have 2 tablespoons of chopped prosciutto this you can omit if you're our vegetarian I like to put in pusher book is a nice little mini flavor to it I have 2 tablespoons diced onions I have a quarter cup of grated Parmesan cheese I have maybe a tablespoon of butter I have some black pepper I had some parsley here I have a quarter cup of heavy cream I have two cups of our marinara sauce very important this is what gives it a great flavor if you don't have prepared marinara sauce if you don't know how to make it I have the recipe in the cookbook and if not you can always buy jarred marinara sauce in a grocery store and here I have about tables two tablespoons of vodka sauce so let me get the canned over here pans want to get hot that's a pasta cooking here I'm going to put in also maybe a tablespoon of olive oil I won't put in too much because I'm gonna have a prosciutto that's gonna render itself so I'm gonna put the prosciutto at first let's get that going you really want that for shoot to the cookers we rendered down fat you'll see how nice and golden again that's getting golden nugget it adds a nice sweetness food so you have the sweetness of the onion and you have the softness of the intruder which is like a match parsley him right away I didn't add these salt and I pitch you right man these for this recipe I think that for sure says daddy if you want to add a touch you can but as I said you're gonna be putting in the grated cheese also so that's a nice place you want is you want to get these onions a little golden you want this prosciutto to run yourself to get a little bit crispy also 30 seconds especially if it doesn't get stuck very important you're making vodka sauce black is very flammable so what you want is you are pulling off the fire I had your vodka ignite now what's happening here is the vodkas actually starting off let me out this will burn off once the alcohol burns off completely you're still gonna have the flavor the vodka [Music] let it burn off buckles burned off in the end marinara sauce good that's marinara sauce put gonna add the heavy cream to it and I'll let that cook down for some seconds [Music] now I want this to come to a boil marinara sauce is already cooked so this should take about a half a minute or so to cook this probably going to be enough sauce for a team of three portions a lot of nice extra another a lot of nice color to it adds a nice layer of flavor to it awesome I like to cook al dente about five to six minutes if this pastas ready so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna dump this pasta out into our major we need about a half pound of pasta here so let me show you what we do with the pasta I'm gonna put it all back in in this pan I like to toss the pasta with the Parmesan cheese in with the sauce okay now I think this is too much sauce for this possible so I'm gonna do is I don't let this cook for another 30 seconds or so let this really really boil itself put the pasta here so what you're doing here is the pasta is getting really really wet our sauce we do here is get our grated cheese and the reading parmesan let me just turn it up and what you can do here also you can cook the pasta another 10 or 15 seconds in the bowl but it really get wet stir it around if you have any extra parsley to pinch a little bit of parchment on here okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plate it all right now if you like a little bit of sauce I like not much sauce on it but what you can do is you have any sauce left over you just ladle it right on right on I have a little bit more parsley control a parsley on top a little bit grated cheese touch your grated cheese and there you have it Gino Torretta is panella vodka
