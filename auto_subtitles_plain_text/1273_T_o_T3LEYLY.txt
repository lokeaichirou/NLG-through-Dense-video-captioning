 hi everyone is Helen here today and we make in a very classic Vietnamese dish it's a crispy fried spring rolls it's called membrane or Keo in Vietnamese the basic feeling for namely Italia is normally crammed with dice mushrooms and julienned or diced vegetables like carrots jicama taro or kuraby the fillings is wrapped in rice paper and then deep fry till golden brown the filling is actually not fixed you can change it to whatever kind of vegetables or meats that you want normally we will use minced pork but you can also use meat chicken turkey or seafood for vegetarian version you can also use tofu just use some paper towel to press it to absorb all the extra moisture and you can mash it with your hands to make it look quite like mincemeat sometimes we also use the food in non vegetarian versions because the tofu can absorb the moisture from the vegetables like some vegetables like carrots or jicama it's gonna make the feelings more crunchy but the thing is actor why the moisture in the vegetables will make the rose quite a soggy so you want to add some other items that can absorb autumn moisture like mashed sweet potatoes or mung beans what makes Vietnamese fried spring rolls different from Chinese egg rolls is that we use rice paper in fact of the wheat flour wrapper rice paper is more delicate and it can easily break when you deep fry so there are more techniques and tips to it that you can apply the left army in the kitchen today to make the most delicious crispy spring roll that you ever had let's begin and recipes let's start with the southern stars crispy spring rolls Oh Jo you will need hundred gram of shredded taro 100 gram of shredded carrot 20 grams dry wood ear mushrooms which I have soaked in hot water and cut into thin strips some glass noodle which is soaked in hot water for 10 minutes means garlic and shallot 200 grams of minced pork and 200 grams of minced rooms shredded taro is more typical for spring rolls from southern Vietnam in a large bowl combine the minced pork and winstram together and season lightly with salt sugar and chicken stock about half a teaspoon each answer a tablespoon of minced shallots and a tablespoon of minced garlic [Music] some pepper miss whale with your hand in a circular motion like this so the seasonings are well incorporated into the meat [Music] that add all the shredded vegetables mushrooms and glass noodle mix really well to help other ingredients to stick to each other better and one eggs or just the egg whites mix well again and leave to sit for about 15 minutes to soften the rice paper for wrapping I have learned a very useful trick from the chef as hired which is to moisten the rice paper with a damp cloth instead of soaking it in water this makes the rice paper flexible enough to work with but not too wet so it's easier to order fry later scoop a heaping tablespoons of the fillings and place nearer to one end shape it nicely lift off the end for offer and then push it backwards just like this this is a trick to distribute the fillings evenly and also have a tight roll then roll until you cross the center of the rice paper then fold the both sides in and continue to roll up until the end tada there you have it very easy right hit the generous amount all it in the pan until you see small bubbles appear around the chopsticks then keep the heat on medium or medium low and start frying the rice paper could be sticky at first so leave some space in between the rows after a few minutes is a tear to bring them closer to each other [Music] [Applause] [Music] when the spring rolls are nicely golden brown you can remove them and place on the rack I'll place on paper towel to drain off the excess oil you can sell them just like that at a starter together with some dipping fish sauce and fresh vegetables and herbs mmm that tastes really good we can also wrap it in a piece of lettuce or rice paper together with the fresh herbs and dip in the dipping sauce now let's make named rang the nuttin version of crispy spring roll you will need flour gram of mints port diced onion julienned carrots mins wood ear mushrooms bean sprouts and
