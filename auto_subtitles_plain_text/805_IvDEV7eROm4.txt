 Oh hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make a ridiculously easy simple and yet delicious fresh tomato soup now about a year ago I showed you how to make a tomato soup and this is just a slightly different version I still absolutely love that recipe but I have been making this recipe so much more now and my husband has a little garden outside our you know back yard so he's got tons of tomatoes growing and I actually showed sort of a few steps of how when I was making the soup on my blog on my second channel which if you don't know I do have a second channel Laura's topics I'll link it down below we're going to be starting we're going to start doing a lot more vlogs we are doing vlogs now so if you want to check them out hop on over there subscribe and give us some live but a lot of people were like show us along in the kitchen how you make that soup it looks amazing so I thought why not it's really easy required a handful of ingredients and it's just delicious but I've got here are some fresh tomatoes so some just some plum tomatoes I've got some little baby heirloom tomato little yellow tomatoes I've got fresh basil a pinch of sugar balsamic vinegar pinch of hot pepper flakes some fresh oregano garlic and shallots that's it no cream no not nothing nothing else we said a little bit of stuff to thin it out after of course so pepper in olive oil but anyways it's easy I'm gonna take first of all you want to pre-heat your oven to 425 I've got a 9 by 13 inch pan here now I know that this is going to look like there's a lot of tomatoes and it should all be you know in one layer now I'm doing that I'm actually I chose to use a smaller pan for a reason because as much as I do want this to caramelize in a will I want them to give out a lot of their own juice and I want that to be some of the liquid that when I blend in I want that to be some of the liquid that's there so it just works really really well I'm just having my Tomatoes now these I am because you know our Tomatoes we just kind of pick a few every single day and there are some that aren't ripe yet but I wanted to share this recipe with you and I went to a farmers market and I mean look how beautiful these tomatoes are I come pass them up you can also make some match you know some roma tomatoes plum tomato wait name you name it whatever you've got it's fresh in season at its best all I'm doing with my garlic is just fashion it with my knife getting rid of the skin and popping it right in there because it's gonna happen is see because we're not roasting it all in a single layer it's not going to develop a lot of color and burn it's going to kind of bubble in its own juices stop again I'm going to caramelize a bit at the top but those flavors are going to be so sweet and delicious that I'm putting a lot of garlic in there because it is going to be so sweet so when you do go ahead and puree it it's just there's an absolutely no overpowering of garlic whatsoever you of course could leave some out it's completely up to you I'm adding some shallots last time I made this you know in the vlog I even added some green onion tops because I use the whites for a different recipe I mean again it's all going to get pureed anyway so might as well just going to take the very first layer off I'm starting my shallots right in adding my hot pepper flakes and dried oregano small little pinch of sugar it's about a teaspoon of sugar and then just a touch of balsamic vinegar you know the sugar balsamic vinegar all they're really doing is helping with a whole carmelization it's really all it's doing and bringing out the sweetness and the tomatoes tons of fresh basil stalks and all good amount of extra virgin olive oil because at the end of the day this is kind of what's going to give you those delicious juices and what those tomatoes are going to roast in so you want to make sure you add a good maybe quarter cup or so this is going to make about four to six servings depending on how big your serving is so about four tablespoons of olive oil it's completely enough for four to six it's hardly anything good now salt and pepper good amount of salt because tomatoes are very very sweet bring this closer to me and just go in with your hands and mix it all together this is gonna be amazing when you put this into the oven and you let it roast all right make sure you get that balsamic and that sugar distribute it really well oops okay I'm gonna wash my hands pop this into the oven 425 for about an hour and a quarter give it a stir every now and then I'll show you what they look like when they're done and I'm gonna show you the little cheese toastie I'm gonna serve this with can have soup without grilled cheese my version anyway my tomatoes were in the oven for about an hour and ten minutes and I just want you to look at what I was saying because we cook them in a slightly smaller pan you get all these incredible juices otherwise the tomatoes would roast which you know the record is great but you wouldn't get them to be kind of soft and their juices to release it's amazing now for me above mozzarella a piece of bread I'm good to go that would be supper all on its own what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put it in my blender now if you don't have a powerful blender I have been thinking for a long time if I wanted to invest in a powerful like a good blender and I'm glad that I did because I use my Blendtec constantly if we don't have a powerful blender you're gonna need to sift massive strain the soup otherwise the skins of the tomatoes are going to be left all over now for me this one I kind of put it on the you know press the soup setting or whatever and it's just purees smoother than I've ever seen it before now don't need to strain it because there's nothing to strain so it's perfect but it's completely up to you I'm just going to try and get it all in here without really making a mess oh good awesome and I'm just going to turn this on and puree it lid on and off she goes boom I love that I don't have to turn it off either is it on its own now you can I mean it's it's totally smooth you concern this as is nice and thick but what I'm going to do is going to pour this into my saucepan I'm going to turn this on that's super high and I'm just going to take some vegetable stock now obviously I don't want to get rid of all that so what I do is I kind of pour my vegetable stock in there give it a swirl and then you can just add as much stock as you'd like to make it as thick or as thin as you like I usually add about a cup of vegetable stock um usually seems to be perfect for me but again you could serve as as is you can thin it out if you want to the world is your pick up my friend might as well like a little splash in there now what I'm gonna serve with this is my little cheese toastie I've got here is a couple slices of these are just whole-wheat baguette because that's just what I buy one of my favorites what I'm gonna do is I just cut them and on a diagonal kind of really as large as I could so I can hit some nice big pieces I'm gonna turn my little skillet on I've got an itty-bitty little skillet here don't turn it on too high maybe but medium low otherwise it'll burn before the cheese get it gets a chance to melt then I'm going to do first of all let's work on the outside take a little bit of butter and just kind of smear it on one side of each one because that's gonna end up being the outside that's going to get all nice and brown and then I'm going to just on a place those and get all dirty take just that any bitty amount of basil pesto store-bought homemade up to you I'll just use a tiny little bit on each side not too much because it can basil pesto can be a bit overpowering and it's got a lot of oil in there so you don't want your end result to be super oily then just a couple sizes this is just a block of mozzarella I had in the fridge sandwich just baby together like so so it's like a fancy grilled cheese and then just kind of keep it there until it gets beautifully colored on one side it's got lovely color and she's all melted that's it we're gonna do that that's gonna happen the same time the soup is getting more and be ready to go look at that delicious creaminess no cream whatsoever it's just pure delicious tomato I'm just I'm too excited to eat to even talk because I want to eat I would also get my little toasty ready it just took a couple of minutes oh my goodness so smooth so creamy oh let me give you I'm doing it mm-hmm so so I think we just went time with me guys I don't know what to lower in the kitchen to get the written recipe I'm going just playing time with me I'm gonna keep Duncan and Eden I'll see you next time bye-bye you
