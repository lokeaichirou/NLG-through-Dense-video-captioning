 hey there I'm back spring now and I wanted to show you how to harvest and enjoy eating your garden snails you're anything like me eating snails a lot in restaurants they're family favorite around here and if you're a gardener you also find the little garden snails pretty obnoxious if you have enough of them making you some real damage to your plants so the best solution for your snails is to harvest them eat them and enjoy them I'll be out of your hair and you get a really nice appetizer out of it if you're going to harvest your snails there's just two things you didn't need to make sure you have in advance one is a bag canvas bag or paper bag to collect them in you want to make sure you'll use plastic because the snails need to breathe and the other is a good container that also allows the snails to breathe so here I'm going to use this plastic Tupperware and I'm going to cover it with some breathable washcloths there once I've collected my snails so make sure you have both of those things before you start otherwise you're not going to have anywhere to put your snails and you collected the best time to look for snails is right after a rain you just had a little bit of a rain shower here and now all of the snails are coming out you can see them there to the tops of the foliage they look for the moisture so they come out into plain view and it easy to find otherwise they're probably hiding under leaves or wherever they can hide during the heat of the day so wait till just after a rain when it's nice and cool and the snails will start coming out be easy to harvest snails because they're very very slow so all you need to do is reach out and pick them off I'm going to put this guy in my bag just like that and then he goes look for the big snails your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to ones you're used to at a restaurant so you just want to look for the big ones and leave the small ones alone I know it's a little hard to see these guys focus but here's another nice big one he comes and in the bag so after a nice spring shower if you're looking through leafy green areas of your garden which is where the snails like to hang out should take you just a couple minutes and get a nice bag full of pretty big snails you can see your garden snails should have these little striped shelves right just like that they're pretty and these are the guys you're looking forward to eat so all I'm going to do now is take my little harvest and put it in my bit come in there and pick off anyone who's trying to escape there we go the garden snails are perfectly safe to eat and really tasty as I said but you don't know what they've been eating the whole time I live out in your garden so one important thing about harvesting snails you can't eat them right away you have to keep them for about a week and feed them a nice clean diet to be sure that they're going to be safe out somebody's escaping so what I like to do is just feed them a little bit of yellow corn just like this just pour some in there they don't really need very much you can actually just feed them nothing for a week as well some people do that but I like to give them a little bit of food so that they stay nice and big so put some formula in your container snails and then cover it up like I said earlier it's very important that the snails be able to breathe because you need them to stay alive during this first week so it's been about two days since I put my snails in their container and here you can see it it actually eating all the cornmeal so they're pretty hungry and you can see there's a lot of snail poop in there as well it's all that white and brown stuff that's a good sign means they're cleaning themselves out so what we need to do now is wash the snails off and wash out their container that's going to get rid of the poop and it's also going to give them a drink they need water like any living creature so this will help them get a drink so what I'm going to do is put them in their column column here just like that as you can see right now they're all dormant they're not moving [Music] and that's perfectly normal at this stage for them to be dormant but they should all wake up once I started spraying them with water so one other benefit of doing this is that you'll find any any dead snails you can take out cuz you don't want any dead ones so just going to turn on cool water and rinse them now you can start to see some of the snails are waking up the little feet are coming out that's what the bottom the snail is called the foot and so for example this guy here clearly awake there's a little antenna and he's getting annoyed at me so I'm going to play him back in the container and as long as they're all waking up get them back in your container and seal it again make sure once again that the snails can breathe and leave them for another couple days and then clean them again so you can see everybody is alive and active and you got to be careful at this point because you will have a lot of attempted escapees they really get going after you spray them down with some water but as long as you've seen them move a little bit or sees a little something coming out of every one of their feet they're definitely alive just make sure you add some more food for them and cornmeal or if you're using white flower or a leaf that's fine too just give them a little more food and seal them back up so it's been one week and my snails have been eating their clean diet of cornmeal there and now it is time to cook the snails the first thing we're going to do is clean them off they've gotten into their own poop a little bit they've probably touched that so we want a nice and clean I'm going to pour a little bit of vinegar bowl here and add some water business vapor and water mix and drop all my snails into a vinegar and water mixture [Music] from an icon [Music] so okay here I have a stockpot with enough water to cover all my snails I've got it at a vigorous boil the snails are clean and they're in their colander and I'm now going to toss them into the stockpot vigorous boil and then put them in for about five minutes so what I'm doing right now is I'm killing six maybe they're alive up to this point and this will kill them and that's one of the reasons I like to make sure the stockpot is at a rolling boil before I throw them in there I figured that we hit go faster it I don't torture the poor little guys so there they are boiling away and we'll give them five minutes in the stockpot so now I boil my snails for five minutes and in water and just let them cool down enough so you can touch them and work with a little bit what we're going to do now is remove the shells your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to snail that you're going to get at a restaurant and so you may have seen in a restaurant snails that are served in their shells one thing that's important to realize about that is that those snails have been taken out of their shells first they've been cooked like I'm going to show you and then they've been put back in their shells for decoration it's very difficult to do that with your garden snails because their shells are small so the technique I'm going to show you is just going to destroy the shell and you'll serve them out of the shells which is another way you'll see them sometimes anyway so all I'm going to do is just crack into the shell with a knife I happen to use a Chinese chef's knife but if you use a Western chef's knife that's fine I'm just going to give them a good crack like this sort of like an egg and the shell is going to crack apart and again kind of like an egg I'm going to remove the shell from around the snail shouldn't come off pretty easy and here you got a snail keep the shells away we're going to rinse those off later and this is a taste is now ready to go so here I've got my snails with the shells removed now the way I showed you how to remove the shells can sometime very small bits of shell on the snail so you want to do is rinse them one more time and just run your fingers through them and your fingers will tell you if you feel anything hard or sharp this little piece of shell and just try to get it out of there but it usually comes off pretty well with the rinse [Music] and you should be all set so now it's time to actually cook the snails and that's pretty easy to do I like to get my snails in beer you could use a white wine as well or just some kind of the stock if you like so I'm going to put in one bottle of the nice Canadian beer here and about a cup and a half of water usually about a one-to-one proportion of beer to water and then put my snails on it I'm going to heat that up bring it to a boil and then I'm going to simmer the snails for between one and three hours one hour for these snails should get them pretty tender but you really can't overcook it so if you want to just keep going that's fine as well so somewhere between one and three hours simmering and just at a boil on the stove top so in here I'm going to make my garlic butter can't have snails webknights garlic butter this is about for the dozen garden snails that I've picked up about a quarter cup of unsalted butter and I've put three cloves of minced garlic already I'm just going to add some herbs to it here I've got about a teaspoon of marjoram a teaspoon of dried parsley and a little bit of tarragon if you don't like tarragon then don't add it salt and pepper to taste and off you go so my snail isn't boiling for about an hour and a half I'm just going to scoop them up with a strainer put them in my butter mix everything together and they are to go a serving dish and to eat snails of course are traditionally eaten with a nice little piece of toast so just pop one on there and there you go you're going to find that these snails from your garden are very tender a very nice flavor probably better than anything you've had before and snails so enjoy
