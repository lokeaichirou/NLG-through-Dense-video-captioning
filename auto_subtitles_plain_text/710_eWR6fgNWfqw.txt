 hi chef Nicole back here on CT bites happy new year you know the weather's getting colder all cooking more I have a delicious recipe I'm going to say today for turkey Asian pot stickers you can even make these vegetarian by simply leaving out the turkey meat so we're going to start with a large nonstick pan we've got two cubes of frozen ginger in here you know how much I love those frozen herbs and we're gonna put in some turkey meat now a little they don't really you don't need much of the filling makeup mousse Hercules we have to shred it terrace which is great you know me I'm always trying to get extra vegetables into my kids and then we are some cold ones of course cut your own cabbage but why bother by this stuff this is great this is really where the pull of the feeling comes in so of course you're getting lots of vegetables if I remember in some bamboo shoots which are also reserving a lots of fiber in which is really nice solar system of those and now on the process all of this little Cuisinart some rice wine vinegar you don't need much always keep your finger over the top you doing delicious language flavor sauces a lot of Chinese cooking you know why I wasn't really wing it it's a full tablespoon and a little bit of soy sauce nobody likes another top and it generally helps get a finger over it and then our final thing a little sweeter some people put sugar on hold of the sweet and sour sauce really gives a nice kind of a sweet tangy flavor to the filling of this and then are you going to do just let this cook down seven minutes get the heat going nice and high break this up as much as you can we are going to process this and the Cuisinart we're going to cook this until it's completely cooked through so it's been about six or seven minutes and you can see our delicious turkey pasta core filling is done you want to make sure that most of liquid has evaporated definitely do not want wet and yucky on the inside of your plastic are now what you want to do is put these in the Cuisinart a food processor you can really chop this by hand if you don't have one but you want to get the check they're pretty fine on the inside and the other trick here you just want to pulse this really quickly so this is all in we're going to sort of uncooked scallions or green onions throw those in I'm just actually found out that you can freeze your leftover chops guys I'm going to go do that today at home want to make sure before you do your paw stickers that you just piss the feeling just finally cottage cheese three or four pulses now look on the inside here you see how it's chopped but not completely machine you know charade now this is going to come on film I'm going to now show you how we're going to actually make the pot stickers all right these positives are all ready to be put together this is actually a really great thing to do with your kids on the weekend just make sure you've got plenty of time to do it now you can buy these rappers one of two ways you can either buy them as egg roll wrappers and they come like right by your produce section of your supermarket or you can fire them as wonton wrappers and if you can't find the wonton wrapper simply cut the egg roll wrappers in half now this is important room you some water I'm just going to basically paint the edges with your finger you can use a brush but of course your hands are your best tools and then all you do is you just fold it over like this now here's the only important part a don't fill it up too much and be make sure these are really pushed together well just like that pretty easy to do my kids love to do this because they can make all sorts of funky shapes they make what they call packages so we're going to do one more they just so I can show you and the other thing that's really great about this feeling is you can also make egg rolls which is really cool so we'll do one more wanton all you do is put the filling in the middle again you don't need much and then you simply fold this over like this and it makes almost instant little pot stickers now egg rolls almost the same thing you just take a whole rapper like this now the only trick is you want to put these sort of at an angle and you can put a little morn now this goes right in the middle just like this and the way that I taught my kids to remember how to do these was I said you tuck the baby in and then you roll them up and look at that you got gorgeous really easy to make turkey egg rolls and now we're going to fry them up and we'll be ready to go we have about three quarters of a cup of hot vegetable or peanut oil do not want to use olive oil it'll get it to fit just cooking we're just gonna pan fry these up remember these are the top too badly because there's no water it's just pretty dry and he's only takes about 30 seconds per side you see we've had this one in about 30 second parts of gorgeous and then all you need to do is make a little dipping sauce over here which is simply soy sauce rice wine vinegar and a tiny pinch of sugars to cut India city you can do a little bits of sesame seeds on top for garnish that's a 10 inch thick in our house so let's get attorneys over and just serve them up and if you want you can also kind of dry these off on soil and we'll just serve these up these past occurs there gorgeous you want to make sure your oils really hot hot hot hot that way you don't just stand the oil for too long and very quickly before you play them up just let them you know Pat them off on a paper towel look at these egg rolls aren't those yummy and then these are going to go right onto here I like to put them a little bit a bit of carrots or some cabbage just add some color look at those we have our beautiful dipping sauce and this is a fabulous meal and quite frankly a really fun thing to do with your kids and there you have a delicious Asian turkey pot stickers from CT bites happy cooking
