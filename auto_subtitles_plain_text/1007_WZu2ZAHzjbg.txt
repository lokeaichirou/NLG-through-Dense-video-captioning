 all righty chef buck here and today we're gonna cook us up a China masala which is an Indian style chickpea dish super delicious super easy give it a try you're gonna love it heat your skillet up on medium-high and we're going to add about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil and once that's heated up we'll throw up cumin seeds in there and then a little bit of asafoetida just a wee little bit if you don't have a sativa that's alright you know you don't have to use it but if you love Indian cooking you want to get a hold of some of this acid Patito it's a super pungent spice and angular lime and the stuff flat-out stinks you know the reason it's called asafoetida is because it smells like ass but you know when it cooks it just totally transforms we're going to throw in some chickpea flour you know what this is going to do it's going to soak up that oil you know we're going to push it around get it a little thick and brown and then we're going to add one can of diced tomatoes now I like to use canned tomatoes when I'm doing most of the Indian dishes I cook I use a canned chickpeas and canned tomatoes you know because they're right there in the cabinet you know I can just boom you know if I'm in a fix you know if I need to cook something quick for dinner Indian food is a great option now it's East Tomatoes start to cook down a little bit I like to beat them up with the spoon you know smash them down a little bit you can blend them before you put them in there if you wanted to but I don't think it's necessary now I'm going to go ahead and add my minced garlic and ginger and stir that around for about a minute man it smells fantastic you know this is such a great dish when I add my chili powder and tumeric you know the chili powder gives it a nice little kick you know you can make it as hot or mild as you want but I like I like a little bit of heat so I'm going to add a hot pepper in here too but there's a million variations of this dish so definitely play around with it throw your chickpeas in there and give those a few minutes turn those around and let that cook up a little bit add you some salt to taste and then a little bit of garam masala now the word masala just means a collection of spices you know and I guarantee I'll you know you can get those in most US groceries now as a cos Indian cooking is so popular and garam masala is kind of a sweet combination it's got some cardamom some cinnamon some cloves fennel black pepper you know all sorts of things there's all kinds of varieties of it now I have one cup of water into the mix get that stirred up and we'll raise the temperature you know we'll bring the dish to a bubble then we'll reduce it down to a simmer throw a lid on there and let it simmer away for about ten minutes now chickpeas are going to be softened up and you can take a fork and go ahead and start to mash some of them down a little bit but I like to go ahead and grab my little potato masher and just randomly crush some of those chickpeas up you know that add that adds kind of a nice thickness to the dish and Plus as with simmers away and you know once we get it off the heat because we put that flour in there earlier that's going to help to thicken it up so just go ahead and stir it around for a few minutes and there you go China masala man this dish is so easy it's so quick to make you know it's a great introduction to Indian cooking so give it a try and let me know what you think ma'am and Bon Appetit
