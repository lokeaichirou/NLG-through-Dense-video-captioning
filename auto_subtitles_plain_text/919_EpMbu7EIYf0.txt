 g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to be cooking my recipe of scrambled eggs so what you're going to need is four eggs 50 grams of cheese grated pinch of salt and about roughly 20 grams of garlic and half a cup of milk I use light milk you can use full cream if that's what you use so those the ingredients for my scrambled eggs recipe now let's get started making first thing you want to do is you want to turn the gas or if you've got an electric stove on too high now most people get their eggs and they put them in a mixing bowl and with milk and stuff and they mix it all together I'm going to do it that way I just do it this way just straight in straight in like that and then turn it down to low add the milk not too much add the garlic now add the cheese so I add all the ingredients at once therefore everything will cook and blend at the same time so there we go just a little bit left just a little bit salt just a pinch and there we have our scrambled eggs and just chop it all together mix it like this now with a little bit of cheese little bit of garlic just give it just a little bit of a kick rather than often people just get scrambled egg mix it together with some milk put it in and and that's it just do an extra two or three little bits of ingredients can go a long way as you can see it's already starting to thicken but as you can see when you look at it it's very even very smooth it's going to come out a really nice texture and keep it on high and constantly constantly mix it in with this constantly mix it don't leave it a mistake that a lot of people make when they're cooking with of its eggs or just regular meals is they go away and leave it come back to get has developed a across its burned from from the underside or the trick that I've learned is keep it moving constantly constantly moving now is we just leave it for a second over about 30 seconds okay mix again so basically what you want is the excess milk here then it's have a bit too much than not enough is there will be some excess milk if you put a little bit too much in which is what I like to do and then you let that evaporate slowly that way it slowly cooks the eggs so rather than rushing and often people make eggs don't have many ingredients in them and you hear people saying you know my eggs that you know they're always dry or their flavorless well do it this way spit you just spend an extra few minutes they would certainly won't be dry they will not be flavorless these are pretty much ready now it's still a little bit of milk of the excess milk that's almost funny you don't want to cook it until all of that is gone because then what's happening is it's no longer evaporating it's saying to suck the moisture out of the eggs and there you go simple different egg recipe scrambled eggs a different way and all that was was four eggs and that's enough if you're having toast that's easily enough for two or three people if you're having eggs just by yourself like I'm going to this is probably more than enough for me very simple very tasty boosting the flavor actually boosting the flavor so join me next time for my next meal
