 chicken curry hi I'm an oppa and I welcome you to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana and a warm welcome to a series of cooking for beginners now let's make a very basic chicken curry chicken curry is something that can be made in so many ways every region has its own peculiar recipe this one is a basic recipe made all over India and there is no specific name for this is it's just plain simple chicken curry and I'm sure you'll love this recipe so let's quickly see what all we need to make this basic chicken curry for chicken curry we need chicken pieces which are cut on the bone grated onion fresh tomato puree oil salt chopped coriander leaves red chilli powder turmeric powder cumin powder garam masala powder garlic paste ginger paste coriander powder cinnamon stick green cardamom cloves okay so let me first explain to you what is an Indian chicken curry Indian chicken curry is quite high in seasonings in spices so and there are a lot of things that actually attribute to make this chicken curry a hit preparation now what happens is that we use some fresh ingredients and we use some powdered whole spices so I'll just explain to you in case of fresh ingredients I have onion and tomato which is going to be my base of the gravy but to make this even more tasty I am going to be adding some whole spices and some powdered spices so primarily I'm going to be using onion now onion here is grated why grated because that is the easiest way to process the onion of course to puree tis even easier but since we are using pureed tomatoes we need not use pureed onions cause you need that little bite or you need that little chunk in the chicken curry so onions we have grated and tomatoes we have used nice bright red ripe tomatoes which we have pureed puree is very simple just cut the tomatoes as in cut the eye of the tomato or the cut it into two to three pieces and blend it in the mixing so you have this tomato puree and you have the onion so first of all we'll first take oil in a non-stick pan I prefer to work in a nonstick pan because it surely saves the efforts and secondly nothing really sticks to the bottom of the pan so you not really worried about your chicken curry or any other preparation getting burned unless you really leave it in the pan for our hours and forget totally about it nothing like this is gonna happen here so once you add oil to this we'll add some whole spices in whole spices will be using cinnamon cloves and green cardamom Indian preparations or Indian curries are quite flavorful with whole spices as well and these ingredients impart a lot of flavor to the curry but you don't need to add lots of it maybe a small piece of cinnamon green cardamom and some cloves so as you add this to the oil you'll automatically get a very nice aroma and this will be there in the curry all the while so it's very important to add whole spices and then there is something that is known as garam masala powder which is a powder or a masala which is made by grinding whole spices not just these three a lot of other and they are lightly roasted and then they are powder so this is a garam masala which is generally used in all Indian preparations across India so after you've added the whole spices and onion now what happens is after you grate onion it kind of leaves water like this so try and squeeze out this excess water cause if there is water in the onion which means it will take a while to brown and in the chicken curry you need nice Brown onions so just squeeze out this excess water like this so when you squeeze out this water browning happens faster and you add it to this oil and you start sauteing this till the onion starts browning now sometimes what happens is while 14 you'll have already got absorbed by the onion because initially we had not added a lot of oil you can easily go on and on with this much oil as well if you are quite calorie con if you think you can easily carry it off by adding some more oil you could add it here or in this case if you were to make it with very less oil you have to keep on sauteing this till the onion starts browning once onion starts browning we will add the other ingredients all the other spices shouldn't be added before the onion Browns because once you added everything else onion will not Brown it will only stay white but since we want the onion to Brown we will not add anything right now what is basically browning of onion onion has got a lot of sugar and when it comes in contact with heat like this it's caramelizes and that is why brown onions always stay sweet since the sugar has got caramelized it tastes sweet and it also turns golden brown so that is a very simple logic behind Browning of onions and of course it also gives a very good flavor to the curry most of the biryani is you see have a brown onion as garnish is only because it gives good look at the same time it also tastes nice and in case of chicken curry we have to brown the onion because in case of onions like this it stays quite raw it doesn't give a good mouthfeel so once you brown the onions it really gets combined with all the gravy and it doesn't separate from the gravy you'll always notice if onions are left raw as and if they are not truly sauteed well they will always separate us and you'll have a tomato grate on one side and you'll have the onions on one side so it is always important to saute the onions to an extent that it starts Brown okay so you see the onion has already started browning now is the time to add other spices we'll first start off with ginger-garlic paste after you add ginger-garlic paste we'll now add turmeric powder we'll add red chili powder red chili powder would depend upon the kind of spicy food you eat at home we'll add some cumin powder and some coriander powder now after you add the whole spices there are chances that it may burn so you may add very little water and just mix this or else the spices would have all got burned since there was very little oil that we had used in the masala okay so now this needs to be sorted for about a minute after you have done this we have to now add tomatoes and tomatoes are in pureed form so we have pureed the tomatoes we'll add all of it here you see after you add the tomato puree the color changes and it goes nice and bright red now in this case if the tomatoes were not red this would not have looked very good it would have given an insipid look and apart from that the red chili powder also that we have used is the Kashmiri when it is not very spicy in it imparts good color so as far as possible try and use kashmiri red chilli powder and bright red tomatoes so this way you'll have a very good nice bright red chicken curry now after we've added the tomatoes will now add salt salt should also be added soon after the tomatoes because that way the tomatoes cook faster because once we add salt to Tomatoes it automatically leaves all the moisture and once all the moisture in the tomato is evaporated the tomatoes are done so here the actual cooking happens where the tomatoes have to cook as in tomatoes if they are left raw the chicken curry doesn't taste too good so onion has to Brown and tomatoes have to cook well so these two things if they happen properly in a chicken curry is a hit so while your tomatoes are getting sorted you can actually get the flavor of the tomatoes which are slightly raw and after a while once the oil starts separating you'll automatically come to know what I mean by cooking of tomatoes so right now we have to saute this for some time till the actual raw flavor of tomato goes off okay so now that the tomato is done you can see little little specks of oil which are seen on the sides like this so which means the tomato has already left the oil and it's now time for us to add the chicken so we have chicken which we have used on the bowl so all of this in this after which we'll add little salt we have already added some salt to the tomatoes we should keep that in mind and not add excess in that case the chicken curry will go quite salty and right now we'll add some coriander as well because fresh coriander when you add it in the gravy it imparts very good flavor so after this just makes this nicely now don't add any water right now because chicken also has a lot of moisture in it and it will also leave all the moisture and giving the curry the required consistency so just mix this in like this we'll add some garam masala powder here this is available most of the grocery stores once again will mix this if needed we'll add water but that will be towards the end and water whatever that you add to the curry will have to be hot cause if you add cold water here the temperature of the gravy will go low and the chicken may go tough so it's very important to add hot water to any curry so let's mix this well yeah that's perfect and after we have mixed this we just gonna cover it and let this cook now chicken curry doesn't take very long to cook it will take somewhere around 20 minutes and so we'll cover this on medium heat for 20 minutes and by the end of it chicken curry will be ready okay so you see the chicken curry is almost done I can see the gravy thickening at the same time the chicken also looks scope okay so all of this looks perfect now if you feel that the curry is thick which even I feel what we can do is we'll adjust it by adding some water but after you add water you'll have to just give it a boil so that it mixes well and that's it then don't for the hook it because again it is going to as far as the curry is concerned this is done we will garnish this with some more coriander just like this and it's good to go if it's thick like this you can serve it with nice paratha which I've already shown you or you can make the simple boiled rice and so it with that it is just amazing to have hot chicken curry and a bowl of plain steamed rice make this recipe just the way I have made it and you'll be very proud of yourself [Music]
