 Nihao hello namaste Salam alikoum cycle he's getting near the festival time at the end of 2007 with whatever entering into more and more homes and kitchens I am flooded with requests for the recipe to the holiday treats and entertainment treats so the fact that I said hello in the house in Chinese should tell you what we are going to do today you got it one of the most popular snacks for entertaining has been the tiny change spring rolls so what exactly are these spring rolls and how do they differ from egg rolls one can easily confuse them with each other the main difference in the two is that the spring rolls are made out of rice or Congress while egg roll wrappers are made with feed base some vary because on culture and individual choices spring rolls are usually eaten using spring festival in China and that is where it gets its name from not because it looks like spring or bounce around in your tummy making you happy so today let's make these spring rolls for this preparation you need to steam your vegetables and squeeze out the water the same way we try to do with our Kafka's so I put one cup of water in a pan what I am going to do I have a lot of vegetables here I have got some cabbage I've got some capsicum carrot onion I even have some spring onion and I used celery celery is one of my favorite term vegetables to get very good flavor so I added all of these and then I'm going to cover it up with a lid so because of the water they don't get burnt first thing second thing is that steam slightly softens this vegetables the reason why I am steaming these vegetables and squeezing out water first thing is you want very little water in your mixture because when you fry the spring rolls you want the spring rolls to remain crispy for longer time the second reason is you want your vegetables to be soft because when you put this as a stuffing and roll you don't want you seat to get tall so for that reason we are going to soften these vegetables and squeeze out the water so as usual all our vegetarians and non-vegetarians like their own variant and you can stop it purely with vegetable filling or even try adding shredded chicken or any other meats to this steaming process and you can make delicious beef spring rolls to prepare these rolls today I got two kinds of roles one is from the refrigerator section other one is a freezer section these are the egg roll drafts you know they are made with the beat based and they could also be used for lasagna so I'm going to use this and second variety which is my favorite for spring rolls because you could buy this tea by J's spring roll pastry it's in your freezer section these are made with confer whereas these are made with little read based so you will see the difference when we fry them but one of these days I promise I'll teach you how to make these spring roll sheets at home so now my vegetable already so these vegetables on my chopping board and let me put my other ingredients down so before I use my chopper let me do me harm the reason is whenever I made this chef's coat and think of chains I think of doing really cool food so why not we do cool food with our vegetable you don't have to chop too much just make sure you chop them a little bit smaller okay now that my cool foo ended so let's put all these vegetables into a muslin cloth so what we are going to do we are going to squeeze out any excess moisture that is there in the vegetables now season these vegetables so they're going to use well as you know motor for nice flavoring very little soya sauce and little pepper and we'll salt little bit chili sauce now that done I've added a chili garlic sauce I will also add some of the Indian spices you know you do add some cumin powder some cumin seeds or whatever spices you want this is what I like about any cooking is making it to your own taste okay so I'll keep this okay take the spring roll sheet put your spring roll mixture okay how much ever you want and then tightly roll it okay if you want a good spring roll tightly roll it bring it to a point then press it they I just till then apply egg wash and then fold it in fold the other side in and press it in and again apply little more egg on the other edge so squeeze it hard and then roll it out so your spring roll is ready so let's make quick so let's make with this egg roll sheets you can see the color difference they are a little bit brownish in color so just put a little bit I'm going to make these are little smaller than those so I'm going to make the smaller spring rolls see watch out fold them in the third edge just you have made this rolls with egg roll and as well as the sprinkles let's see how they turn out one egg roll one spring roll one spring roll one egg roll so make sure you don't dump all of them the oil will get cool and especially for spring rolls you want behind to be nicely hot at 350 if you fry them with like a lower temperature so oil will lose into those spring rolls now look at this the egg rolls which are made with the wheat flour they are ready so we're going to keep them aside whereas our spring rolls that is made with corn flour will take a little longer time but you know they have they will get a different texture okay okay friends today we made them kind of rolls with this spring roll sheets and with the egg roll sheet this is one of the greatest appetizer you can make while you're making your change meal or even a snack for your good party and here is the egg roll skin sheets that is made with wheat flour these are the spring roll sheets that is made with corn flour so now when you go to a Chinese restaurant and you see little bit dark brown color not as crispy they are egg rolls and the ones which are crispy and will lighter and golden in color they are sprinkles you can have your spring rolls with nice silly garlic sauce or any soya base dipping in fact they go very well with the Indian nice sweet tamarind sauce and tomato sauce so then I have gone now and please my Chinese cuisine fans come back and tell me how you did with these spring rolls remember that Wawa is all about eating fresh food and
