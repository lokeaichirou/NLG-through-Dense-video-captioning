 hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make penne vodka now I've gotten so many people requested for this recipe and I mean it's so easy but it's really really delicious and this is the exact recipe we use at our restaurant so I know you guys are gonna love it was a huge hit every time let's go over the ingredients so we can get started I'm gonna need some crushed Tomatoes some vodka heavy cream dried oregano hot pepper flakes small onion finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic minced you're gonna need some olive oil obviously song pepper penne pasta and Parmesan cheese but this is just to make the sauce so let's get started let's go over to the stove and stuck a clean up our onions and garlic I have a nice deep pain here with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and you can use regular olive oil not the expensive extra-virgin stuff and I'm going to put in it's not heating it's not too of too hot which is fine and then just add in my onion and I'm going to cook this this is over medium heat and I put it over medium high and I'm just going to cook this to get to bow kind of translucent and I wanted to get to 2 colored about 5 6 minutes or so my onions are perfect at this point we got a little nice color on them I'm gonna put in my chopped garlic and let this cook for about a minute or so I've reduced the heat to medium medium-high I was a little too hot I'm gonna let this cook for a minute now after a minute I'm going to add in a pinch of hot pepper flakes and you can add as much or as little as you want and depends on how hot you like your food and I'm going to add in a nice pinch of dried oregano try to make it out in fresh oregano with any drier in fresh herbs but the dry herbs you put them in at the at the beginning of your dish with fresh herbs you put them at the end the drive everything to develop their flavor just gonna okay perfect now I'm going to add in our bathtub this is regular not flavored vodka you do not want flavored vodka you wouldn't pull like vanilla vodka and here anything it would just be horrible put this in okay I'm going to let this reduce by half Maybach is reduced by half concentrate all the flavor now we're going to add in our crushed tomatoes I like it every little bit out of the 28 ounce can okeydoke give this a stir oh yeah this is going to be so so good now I'm gonna knock the back not to be back to medium-low partially cover this just like that and let this cook for about 45 minutes and you want to come in and stir it every 10 minutes or so just to make sure nothing's sticking and after about 30 minutes get a big pot filled with water get that to come to a boil soaking and your pasta but otherwise the sauce needs to cook for 45 minutes my sauce has been cooking for 45 minutes on low and it's exactly how it should be very very thick that's perfect it's about 10 minutes away from being done which is exactly the perfect time to add the pasta to your boiling water just kind of add my head am using penne with lines on them they really grips to the sauce really well but that in salted water make sure you salt it well you know the ruler should be as salty as a Mediterranean okay back to this we're going to pass the end now we need to season it with salt and pepper because we haven't seasoned it yet you have a season that at all actually okay put the heat up to medium season it with some pepper perfect just going to give this a quick little taste so where is my spoon I lost my spoon so I'm just going to exact the perfect amount of seasoning so that's good so now I'm going to add in the heavy cream very very important when you're making vodka sauce okay put my heat up to medium what's not bubbling as much as I would like it to so I'm going to let's just put it up to medium-high incorporate your cream in just like so and this is going to cook for another eight minutes or so I've had my sauce cooking it's about eight minutes now I've also drained my pass I'm adding just a couple of fresh basil leaves smells fantastic oh I wish you could smell this it's really amazing okay now we're going to add our joint oops our dream pasta now you want to make sure to cook al dente nothing Orson overcooked pasta you can turn this off at this point and just mix it from the bottom up just like so I'm just going to continue to mix this and then we're going to go over to the table and plate this up everything's pretty much mixed now the last thing greedy very very very important is fresh Parmesan Reggiano and we're going to give this a good great bout quarter cup of this in here and this really really rounds out the sauce I mean without it it's so good and everything but with the fresh parmesan in there it just makes it that much better it makes it restaurant quality which is why it was such a hit in our restaurant and now I know that my daddy would be very proud to see this because it was one of our best sellers and I was thrilled to be able to share it with you guys okay that's about right but a quarter cup and you want to make sure you use a good Pomodoro Jonel I mean I know it's a little bit more expensive to use the authentic stuff but it makes a world of a difference and if you're trying to achieve that restaurant quality taste in your own kitchen then just go ahead and best in like 12 bucks and buying a good piece of coming down at Jonel rather than buying you know the little tubs of pregrated cheese for like four dollars i mean who are they kidding that's the best stuff is dry and it just smells awful and the real stuff is really worth it so this is just this is done this is absolutely done all I need to do is give this a test before I plead it it smells so good well it's gonna be a big bite like dynamite I could eat this entire pan and look at this from cooking the sauce low and slow look how thick that is you see there's no liquid here there's no water coming out from the tomatoes it's not going to do that because we cooked it for so long it's a perfect consistency I don't know this is amazing I hope you guys enjoy spending time with me I hope you go ahead and make this because we're gonna absolutely love it and to get this recipe on the recipes check out my website WWE title arnica chin they're calm after next time bye you
