 yeah hi thanks for watching this video we're going to make a California roll and first we need a piece of see with this is half of the that normally comes this is the way they could we use it on the sushi bars okay so we put the sea with this way and you put some water on our hands so the rice doesn't stick and make sure don't put too much water otherwise the rice will absorb it ed fall apart just whatever you need so we're going to do on the shape of a tamale kind of the sushi rice and split it spread all over this way some substance get to it then we have a digging naked kind of perfect if you want to but this will be good enough we have a wet towel which is going to wet the cutting board so the rice doesn't stick to our cardboard as you can see and next we're going to put some couple slices of avocado couple slices of cucumber if we have our crab salad it is a video in my channel and how to make this or you can just put strips of imitation crab or king crab but I recommend you to do these mix it is have some mail in sesame oil and gives a very good flavor to it so gonna grab some of that in put it right on the middle not too much because otherwise you will have a room to roll it up little water in our hands then we're going to get this corner and push everything with our finger so weak and roll it you go this way and make sure there is the other edge still room in there so you can roll it up once you roll it you have visible last Rock put it on top so often so the one who doesn't stick to it we have given boot right here and then we're going to push this we have this common a finger on the corners then this one right in the middle at the same time you cannot push and if we should right in the middle only everything will come up so put the corners push it then we got the square square one you can also make the angels what each way then we have a nice square drove to cut it we got to put some water in our life so the rice doesn't stick to it we're going to slice right on the middle do the same thing with the other pieces so we can have a equal sizes as you can see this is a nice California Road let's see sesame seeds around already you can put some more reviews 1-2 on top and then i'll put on a play they create the way to you like it and i hope you like this recipe thank you so much
