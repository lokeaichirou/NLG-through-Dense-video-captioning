 the chef Julian Inge of station 5 table and bar in South Miami a new American cell restaurant with some international Flair I wanted to bring all of these soulful traditional dishes and unite them in one place it's kind of like a home away from home it's got food that's comfortable and interesting station five serves dinner Tuesday through Sunday with lunch on Thursdays and Friday and brunch on the weekends and any time is good for the dish we're making today croque monsieur it's very very indulgent it definitely would satisfy the hungry man and all of us first chef Julia makes a bechamel sauce in a hot pot add butter and let it melt then add flour and stir we're gonna let that toast now add whole milk kosher salt blend and simmer simmer several minutes and when it starts to thicken add grated Parmesan and Gruyere cheese --is when they melt set aside on low heat next put butter on the grill and toast slices of sourdough bread and black forest ham I personally like to grill my ham I do that to add more Gruyere on the ham and some Dijon mustard on the bread now put the ham on the bread and top it with the bechamel sauce this is not a sandwich for the faint of heart pop it in the oven under the broiler for a couple of minutes to toast the cheese when it's ready plate with French fries the croque monsieur sandwich and some homemade ketchup trip on with our croque monsieur we suggest having a fresh mimosa welcome to station five table and bar this is our croque monsieur enjoy
