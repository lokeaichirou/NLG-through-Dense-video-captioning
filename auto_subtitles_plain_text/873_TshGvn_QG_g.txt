 hi thanks for watching we're gonna make a traditional California action douses the first telephone at all we make with the sea with outside a lot of people prefer the flavor of the sea with outside in a lot of people prefer the rice outside so what we're gonna do is we have water to turn our hands of the rice doesn't stick in our hands the other sushi rice right here so we gonna put instead of this way you know this way for this row so we have more room with rice on it this will be enough amount right just half of it we will see some uses on it slice of avocado slices of cucumber in our crab salad we have this crowd saveth already made in my channel this is a video on how to make this with all the ingredients so we put the crab salad or you can just put shape of a crab or king crab imitation crab whatever you want in there but the salad is better he has a little Mayo in a sesame oil and then it gives a very special flavor so we can roll it up right here now to the other just this much just enough to press it and we can slice and either the seaweed if this is coming too much you can make it bigger but it's not really nice and hearty so this size is pretty good so we use the Devon goo and press it this has a plastic wrap already / then you can just put the plastic and use the bamboo little water on the other edge so these sticks together and just slice it we put water on our knives of the doesn't stick in the net the resin power knife this is the traditional California Road thank you so much
