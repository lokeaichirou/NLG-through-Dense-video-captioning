 if you're looking for a great easy left over friendly dinner you can't get any better than fried rice not only does it use cold leftover rice from your refrigerator but you can throw kind of anything in there and it makes a great meal today I'm making a version with ground pork start off by mincing one sort of large clove of garlic and one tablespoon of ginger or make sure that you peel it first and then very thinly slice it across you could grade it too but I find that the yield on minced ginger is much greater than when you grate it and I don't mind little pieces of ginger in fact I love little pieces of ginger so you cut it into little thin strips and then cut crosswise those strips into mints I like to add a little bit of egg to my fried rice so I'm gonna scramble two eggs whisk them these with just a little bit of soy sauce about a quarter of a teaspoon that's in place of salt though I do find that sometimes you want to add just a little bit of salt to fried rice anyway because soy sauce while it's salty it doesn't enhance the flavors in quite the same way as salt so add about a tablespoon of oil to a walk or a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat add your eggs what you're doing here is making a very thin omelet and it should cook really really quickly in a hot pan in classic style you don't even stir it you just sort of let it sit in there and set which is happening very quickly it's almost set if you can flip it over I'm gonna do it guys oh hey good enough you're gonna cut it up into little pieces anyway take your eggs out sort of chop your egg or cut it into little thin shreds whatever you want the egg will be added back in after everything else is incorporated so you can just set that aside while you're cooking everything else add another tablespoon of oil to your pan and then add one scallion just the white parts the green parts you'll save for later the ginger and garlic and you want to cook that until they're fragrant and that won't take very long because that pan was already hot so like 30 seconds to a minute mm-hmm may be one of my favorite smells add your pork it's a half a pound of ground pork if you're using precooked pork like you had some leftover if you would add it at the end just to heat through but this pork needs to be cooked when your pork seems to be almost completely done which mine is nice and opaque add two carrots shredded half a cup of peas these can be defrosted frozen peas or any other vegetable stir it around then add two cups of cooked rice the great thing about this recipe is leftover rice actually worked better than fresh rice stir and then you're basically done except for the seasoning and I'm gonna season this today with soy sauce and rice vinegar about two tablespoons of soy sauce and rice wine vinegar not the seasoned kind but the unseasoned kind so plain rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar has sugar and other seasonings in it it doesn't go so well with all things so I always buy the unseasoned it's a very specific flavor now you're wanting to keep everything through add your egg dinner is served and I'll tell you something else this makes a fantastic breakfast simply fantastic use for leftovers and just like that dinner is on the table fried rice great with leftovers and great from scratch you hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this
