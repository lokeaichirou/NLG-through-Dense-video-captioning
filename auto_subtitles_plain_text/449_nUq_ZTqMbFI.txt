 hi everybody this is Valentina from the real Italian kitchen and today we're gonna make carbonara so the first thing I did for carbonara was to put large pot of water on the stove to boil the pasta that I'm gonna use is spaghetti by the chico and they need to cook in abundant boiling water while that happens I prepare I grate the cheese that I'm gonna use which is going to be half parmigiano-reggiano and half pecorino romano and I'm gonna cut my main ingredient of carbonara which is well actually it's one Charlie but you can't get it here so I'm using fanchetti that I bought on supermarket Italy calm you can find a detailed list of the ingredients in the more info area below the video so let's cut it I've never tried this so I'm really curious its vacuum sealed and what I want to do is just cut cut into little cubes warming up the non-stick pan and I'm just gonna throw the punch it top in it and I'm gonna let it sizzle let it brown and it's gonna create its own oil its own fat so I'm not gonna add any cooking time for the spaghetti is nine minutes I'm gonna cook it for seven minutes and then check it and see if it's al dente which is the way I like it our pancetta is definitely ready look at how golden-brown it it became it's nice and crispy I'm gonna turn the fire off and just let it sit there for a second until my spaghetti and my eggs are ready break the egg in a bowl and then whip it with a fork one thing you can do to make sure that the egg is not too runny in the pasta is to pull the egg out of the fridge earlier so that it's not fridge cold and warm it up in some warm water and I also warmed up the glass bowl with some warm water as well so that it doesn't it's not gonna cools down the pasta when we throw it in there strain the pasta make sure there is no extra water in it and just mix it in with the egg see beautiful the parmigiano mixed with the pecorino a lot of it and the pancetta with all its beautiful natural fat this is for two people and I used approximately 150 grams of pasta which is 1/4 of the box there it is it's done serve with some more parmigiano or pecorino on top and if you like it and you can have it some pepper it's delicious on top of it and la mort de siouah how they say it in Rome and I hope you enjoy I hope you try it thank you for following the real Italian kitchen touch ow
