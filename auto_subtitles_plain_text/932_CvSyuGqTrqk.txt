 yeah [Music] hey what's up guys I know you guys can see the Olympic rings on my screen and the Olympics on this o'clock board and basically this is because I'm taking part and this thing that YouTube's next lab has set up they've chosen 100 youtubers to basically use their channels as a vehicle to support the Olympics and sort of just a rally around the Olympics among those hundred youtubers they're teamed up into a dozen different teams and I'm teamed up with a few awesome youtubers they're way way cooler than me please check them out I'm going to link them at the end of every one of these videos that I'll be posting for the next I think four or five weeks so please keep on the lookout for these videos today's recipe is going to be fish and chips and honor where the Olympics are being held and this is the dish that I really really enjoy because from my childhood I always used to go to Long John Silver's and I really thought that was like the only place you could ever get fish and chips and then when I became a chef I realized I can make my own fish and chips so I'm gonna teach you guys how I make my fish and chips and you guys can modify it however you like but this is a pretty good base on sort of how to fry and batter it and what it should look like it's a little bit more rustic but I think you guys enjoy it so let's dig in I think I hear the turning of key I'm fine leo so the first thing I want to start out with is slicing these Yukon Gold potatoes and then julienne them into the chips or fries as we all know it that helps me conquer this great divide the distance it's not everybody has a deep fryer at their home I'm gonna fry these in a shallow amount of oil and they're gonna come out more like hash browns and fries [Music] so this is a pretty straightforward beer batter recipe all you need is a nice light blonde beer flour salt and pepper there once was a time when we were young and pirates and spaceships we're heroes unsung in all the battles we had won I'm coming pretty much any white fish can be used for this recipe just make sure you cut them into uniform pieces for even cooking times turning inside that helps me conquer this great day the distance is far and wide I'm coming home [Music] you want your oil at about 375 degrees before you start frying that helps me conquer this Great Divide the distance is far and wide I'm coming home since fish and chips can be a pretty greasy mess just blot everything off with a clean towel there once was a time when we were young when pirates and spaceships where our heroes unsung in all the battles we had won I'm coming home I'm gonna garnish this with a roasted lemon and a bit of cilantro and basically just kick back and watch the Olympics and really enjoy this fish and chips yonward may have no end but I'll never stop my friend find my way home [Music] there's something churning inside that helps me conquer this great the distance is far and wide I'm coming home you [Music]
