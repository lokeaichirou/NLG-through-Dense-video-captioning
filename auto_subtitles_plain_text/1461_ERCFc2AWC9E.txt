 bozo Metheny and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan this month I've got to do a series of French recipes so let's waste no time and get stuck into what is my favorite beef stew it's rich it's delicious it's beef bourguignon for the beef I've got 500 grams of steering steak cut into things resembling cubes now I need to make a marinade for this never mind mate I've got a sliced stick of celery a sliced carrot a sliced leek a small one yet that I've cut into quarters and sliced 2 finely chopped cloves of garlic and a dozen black peppercorns put all the ingredients thus far into a large bowl pour on half a liter of red wine obviously if you're making boeuf bourguignon then add wine from the Burgundy region would be good now I know the Ison nut jobs will have a problem with me even using the word wine so I have a message for those people it's your problem get over it mix it all up cover it and then put it in the fridge for at least four hours but preferably overnight strain the vegetables in the marinade pick the beef out just patted dry and some kitchen towel and put it into a clean bowl now add 3 tablespoons of plain flour to the beef and mix well put the marinade in a pan bring to the boil then simmer to reduce the volume by a half meanwhile melt a hundred grams of butter in a pan over a medium heat now in the key 5 minutes once the meat browned you can add in the strained vegetables together with a teaspoon of tomato paste squirt things stir-fry for a further five minutes this is looking good so I'll now add in the reduced marinade together with five hundred mils of beef stock and a bouquet garni which in my case has to be in the form of a tea bag now just to be clear I'm not using a tea bag instead of a bouquet garni the bouquet garni I use it comes in tea bag for a cube form and nobody's paying me to show you those mix it all around bring it all to the boil then when it comes to the boil turn the heat down cover and simmer for about an hour there and a half meanwhile melt 40 grams of butter in a pan over a medium heat add a hundred grams of small onions and so taking is gently for five to ten minutes you can also add a hundred grams of lardons or chopped bacon establish whatever your needs have browned a little add in a hundred and fifty grams of mushrooms cut the baking mushrooms into quarters now I'm going to continue to saute this for another five minutes after 5 minutes turn off the heat one less stir then just put to one side after beefs been singing for an hour at the mushrooms and onions in mix well now cover and cook for another hour before serving this is just so flavorful eat it with some good crusty French bread so there you have it the best beef stew in the world notice how I've decided to dress like the French because all French people wear Berets and stripy shirts and everybody knows that join me next time for some more French cuisine in my busy kitchen until then what happens
