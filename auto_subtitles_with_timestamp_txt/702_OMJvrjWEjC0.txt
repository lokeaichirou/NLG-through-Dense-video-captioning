00:00:30.869 bacon
00:00:31.140 here
00:00:31.500 so
00:00:32.340 in

00:00:36.989 a
00:00:37.110 sprig

00:00:37.530 of
00:00:37.680 rosemary
00:00:38.510 and
00:00:39.510 when
00:00:39.660 that
00:00:39.780 gets
00:00:40.110 looking

00:00:40.649 just

00:00:46.739 you
00:00:46.829 do
00:00:46.980 that
00:00:47.160 because
00:00:47.610 it
00:00:47.879 could
00:00:47.969 flare

00:00:48.300 up
00:00:48.450 and
00:00:48.719 it
00:00:49.320 usually
00:00:49.440 doesn't

00:00:53.309 really
00:00:53.430 shallow
00:00:53.699 panic
00:00:54.120 and
00:00:54.270 flame

00:00:54.449 up
