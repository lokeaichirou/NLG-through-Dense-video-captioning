00:00:13.620 what
00:00:14.610 it
00:00:14.760 does
00:00:14.970 is
00:00:15.300 basically
00:00:15.510 a
00:00:15.809 mold
00:00:16.139 so
00:00:16.740 you

00:01:06.030 line
00:01:06.440 it
00:01:07.440 will
00:01:07.620 come

00:01:14.250 scissors
00:01:14.460 for
00:01:14.640 this
00:01:14.880 one
00:01:15.170 just
00:01:16.170 make

00:01:16.680 very
00:01:17.190 fine
00:01:17.700 strips
00:01:18.480 of
00:01:19.160 about
00:01:20.160 one
00:01:20.760 centimeter

00:01:22.820 this
00:01:23.820 is
00:01:24.000 going
00:01:24.240 to
00:01:24.420 bind
00:01:24.660 the
00:01:25.230 sushi
00:01:25.530 together

00:01:25.680 with
