00:01:29.810 it's
00:01:29.960 a

00:01:30.020 little
00:01:30.229 different

00:02:12.770 I
00:02:12.980 mean

00:02:13.160 literally
00:02:13.430 it
00:02:13.580 takes
00:02:13.880 under
00:02:14.240 a
00:02:14.270 minute
00:02:14.540 to

00:02:14.660 make
00:02:14.780 the
00:02:14.960 stone
00:02:16.090 okay

00:02:17.360 is
00:02:17.540 in
00:02:17.660 a

00:02:17.720 nice
00:02:17.900 ball
00:02:18.290 so
00:02:18.920 we're
00:02:19.250 going
00:02:19.370 to
00:02:19.430 take
00:02:19.580 just
00:02:19.850 a

00:02:19.970 couple
00:02:20.150 of
00:02:20.300 drops
00:02:20.570 of
00:02:21.230 oil
00:02:21.790 just
00:02:22.790 to
00:02:22.910 lightly

00:02:23.150 coat
00:02:23.510 it
00:02:23.780 and
00:02:23.990 that
00:02:24.560 way
00:02:24.710 it
00:02:25.190 doesn't
00:02:25.520 form
00:02:25.730 a

00:02:25.850 dry
00:02:26.090 skin
00:02:26.570 on
00:02:26.780 top
00:02:27.260 of
00:02:27.320 the
00:02:27.500 dough
00:02:27.820 okay
00:02:28.820 so
00:02:28.880 the

00:02:29.060 dough
00:02:29.210 is
00:02:29.390 nicely
00:02:29.630 coated
00:02:30.020 with

00:02:33.200 about
00:02:33.320 15
00:02:33.740 to
00:02:33.950 20
00:02:34.310 minutes
00:02:36.850 so
00:02:37.850 if

00:02:37.970 you're
00:02:38.210 not
00:02:38.780 comfortable
00:02:39.050 using
00:02:39.560 your
00:02:39.860 hands

00:02:40.220 while
00:02:40.400 making
00:02:40.670 the
00:02:41.060 dope
00:02:41.840 here's
00:02:42.709 another

00:02:42.830 alternative
00:02:43.700 way
00:02:43.820 of
00:02:43.850 doing
00:02:43.970 it
00:02:44.330 here

00:02:48.890 processor
00:02:49.430 and
00:02:49.640 if
00:02:50.510 you
00:02:50.600 notice
00:02:50.930 I'm
00:02:51.200 using
00:02:51.400 a

00:02:52.400 chopping
00:02:53.150 blade
00:02:53.930 and
00:02:54.260 setup
00:02:54.740 for
00:02:54.770 dough
00:02:55.070 blade

00:02:55.220 because
00:02:55.610 it
00:02:55.730 just
00:02:56.320 mixes
00:02:57.320 better
00:02:57.560 and
00:02:57.980 it
00:02:58.280 gets

00:02:58.580 all
00:02:58.760 the
00:02:58.940 edges
00:02:59.330 and
00:02:59.630 there's
00:03:00.080 nothing
00:03:00.320 left

00:03:00.500 of
00:03:00.650 the
00:03:00.800 sides

00:03:02.390 salt
00:03:02.630 at

00:03:02.930 this
00:03:03.050 point
00:03:04.540 and
00:03:05.540 I'm
00:03:06.320 going

00:03:06.500 give
00:03:06.620 it
00:03:06.739 a

00:03:21.390 for
00:03:21.810 30

00:03:22.049 seconds
00:03:22.620 and

00:03:23.819 going
00:03:24.150 to
00:03:24.239 pour
00:03:24.450 it
00:03:24.599 in

00:03:50.200 okay
00:03:51.200 I

00:04:09.799 really

00:04:10.340 good

00:04:10.909 making
00:04:11.450 going

00:04:22.880 at
00:04:23.000 a
00:04:23.120 time
00:04:23.360 and
00:04:23.660 just
00:04:23.690 use
00:04:24.139 it
00:04:24.320 every
00:04:24.620 day

00:04:24.970 and
00:04:25.970 with
00:04:26.330 something
00:04:26.539 to
00:04:26.720 put

00:04:31.880 little
00:04:32.060 bit
00:04:32.210 so
00:04:32.539 that
00:04:32.690 it

00:04:32.840 doesn't
00:04:33.110 dry
00:04:33.289 out
00:04:34.030 and
00:04:35.030 cover

00:04:44.599 for
00:04:44.630 about
00:04:44.780 15

00:04:45.320 to
00:04:45.979 20
00:04:46.280 minutes
00:04:46.610 and
00:04:46.820 we're
00:04:47.210 going
00:04:47.330 to
00:04:47.360 need
00:04:47.599 it

00:04:47.780 one
00:04:47.960 time
00:04:48.169 quickly
00:04:49.960 so
00:04:50.960 how
00:04:51.110 many
00:04:51.169 toboggans

00:04:54.889 flour

00:04:55.490 it
00:04:55.699 makes
00:04:56.330 approximately
00:04:56.650 90
00:04:57.650 puppies
00:04:57.979 so

00:04:58.729 there's
00:04:59.509 no
00:04:59.660 science
00:05:00.080 involved

00:05:01.190 big
00:05:01.550 chapatis
00:05:02.090 it
00:05:02.300 can
00:05:02.419 be

00:05:02.840 less
00:05:03.080 or
00:05:03.259 if
00:05:03.380 you
00:05:03.470 want
00:05:03.680 small
00:05:03.949 ones
00:05:04.160 you
00:05:04.340 know

00:05:04.490 it'll
00:05:04.699 make
00:05:04.729 more
00:05:05.030 but
00:05:05.650 something
00:05:06.650 that
00:05:06.800 fits

00:05:06.979 into
00:05:07.310 your
00:05:07.669 palm
00:05:08.240 a
00:05:08.479 closed
00:05:08.840 fist
00:05:09.139 that's
00:05:09.470 I

00:05:09.800 don't

00:05:47.960 your
00:05:48.320 first
00:05:48.500 chapati
00:05:48.919 on

00:05:50.990 heating

00:05:51.680 take
00:05:51.860 our
00:05:52.039 dough
00:05:52.219 and
00:05:52.460 form
00:05:53.419 a
00:05:53.509 nice

00:05:53.690 round
00:05:54.080 ball
00:05:54.199 if

00:05:55.039 start
00:05:55.310 off
00:05:55.400 with
00:05:55.550 a
00:05:55.580 round

00:05:55.820 ball
00:05:56.000 chances
00:05:56.479 are
00:05:56.630 your
00:05:56.870 final
00:05:57.199 chapati
00:05:57.620 will

00:05:57.830 probably
00:05:58.490 be
00:05:58.669 round
00:05:58.909 also
00:05:59.199 we're
00:06:00.199 going
00:06:00.320 to

00:06:00.380 dip
00:06:00.530 it
00:06:00.650 in
00:06:00.740 some
00:06:00.860 dry
00:06:01.070 flour
00:06:01.219 shake
00:06:02.150 off
00:06:02.330 the

00:06:02.419 excess
00:06:02.509 and
00:06:03.159 roll
00:06:04.159 it
00:06:04.310 out
00:06:04.430 now
00:06:05.300 this
00:06:05.449 rolling

00:06:05.659 pin
00:06:05.930 is
00:06:06.169 my
00:06:06.500 favourite
00:06:06.979 it's
00:06:07.159 a
00:06:07.310 thinner

00:06:07.669 version
00:06:07.759 but
00:06:08.659 a
00:06:08.690 lot
00:06:08.990 of
00:06:09.020 people
00:06:09.139 are
00:06:09.380 used
00:06:09.650 to

00:06:09.770 the
00:06:09.979 thicker

00:06:10.420 versus
00:06:10.630 rolling
00:06:10.960 pins
00:06:11.170 whatever
00:06:11.530 you
00:06:11.650 have
00:06:11.830 is

00:06:11.980 absolutely
00:06:12.160 fine
00:06:12.700 and
00:06:13.360 if
00:06:13.990 you
00:06:14.080 notice
00:06:14.350 that

00:06:14.470 your
00:06:14.590 chapati
00:06:14.890 is
00:06:15.010 sticking
00:06:15.460 to
00:06:15.880 the
00:06:16.000 ground

00:06:16.150 or
00:06:16.450 you
00:06:16.990 know
00:06:17.110 whatever
00:06:17.260 surface
00:06:17.530 you're

00:06:17.800 rolling
00:06:18.160 it
00:06:18.220 out
00:06:18.310 on
00:06:18.520 take
00:06:19.000 it
00:06:19.030 and
00:06:19.360 dip
00:06:19.900 it

00:06:20.050 again
00:06:20.140 in
00:06:20.470 the
00:06:20.560 dry
00:06:20.710 flour
00:06:23.370 well
00:06:24.370 you
00:06:24.640 make
00:06:24.790 it

00:06:24.820 look
00:06:25.030 so
00:06:25.090 easy
00:06:25.380 this
00:06:26.380 is
00:06:26.590 really
00:06:26.860 easy
00:06:27.070 but
00:06:27.520 the

00:06:27.760 key
00:06:27.940 is
00:06:28.090 it
00:06:28.330 takes
00:06:28.570 a
00:06:28.690 lot
00:06:28.840 of
00:06:28.870 practice
00:06:29.350 and

00:06:29.970 you
00:06:30.970 know
00:06:31.060 when
00:06:31.210 you
00:06:31.300 first
00:06:31.450 start
00:06:31.810 chances

00:06:32.380 are
00:06:32.530 your
00:06:32.830 two
00:06:33.070 parties
00:06:33.370 will
00:06:33.580 not
00:06:33.760 be
00:06:33.880 around

00:06:34.060 and
00:06:34.450 that's
00:06:34.660 perfectly
00:06:35.170 okay
00:06:35.230 they're
00:06:35.800 still

00:06:36.100 going
00:06:36.280 to
00:06:36.310 taste
00:06:36.520 great
00:06:37.620 the
00:06:38.620 more
00:06:38.830 you
00:06:38.950 do

00:06:39.100 this
00:06:39.250 the
00:06:39.310 better
00:06:39.940 chances
00:06:40.570 you
00:06:40.630 have
00:06:40.930 of

00:06:40.960 getting
00:06:41.350 a
00:06:41.410 prettier
00:06:41.830 final
00:06:42.310 product
00:06:42.780 and

00:06:43.780 this
00:06:44.560 is
00:06:44.710 a
00:06:44.770 trick
00:06:45.010 that
00:06:45.190 my
