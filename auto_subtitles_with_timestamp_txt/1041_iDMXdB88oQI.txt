00:02:11.900 are
00:02:12.020 a
00:02:12.050 lot
00:02:12.260 bigger
00:02:12.590 and

00:02:17.330 is
00:02:17.510 I
00:02:17.540 use
00:02:17.930 purple
00:02:18.290 onion

00:02:22.010 but
00:02:22.190 purple
00:02:22.580 I
00:02:22.670 think
00:02:22.700 this
00:02:23.060 really

00:02:23.209 makes
00:02:23.540 a
00:02:23.660 difference

00:02:24.000 in

00:02:24.480 I
00:02:24.810 use
00:02:25.260 about
00:02:25.470 1/2

00:02:31.080 use
00:02:31.230 more
00:02:31.530 if
00:02:31.680 you
00:02:31.860 want

00:02:33.420 that's
00:02:33.690 been

00:02:34.730 ok
00:02:35.730 so
00:02:35.790 this
00:02:36.060 is

00:02:51.030 it
00:02:51.240 goes
00:02:51.420 stale
00:02:51.750 so

00:02:52.020 this
00:02:52.140 was
00:02:52.290 a
00:02:52.320 great
00:02:52.650 way
00:02:52.890 to
00:02:53.190 think
00:02:53.880 of
00:02:54.060 how

00:02:54.230 another
00:02:55.230 use
00:02:55.530 for
00:02:55.560 stale
00:02:56.100 pita
00:02:56.340 bread
00:02:56.610 instead

00:02:56.820 of
00:02:57.000 throwing
00:02:57.150 it
00:02:57.360 away
00:02:57.480 they
00:02:57.989 came
00:02:58.140 up
00:02:58.320 with

00:02:58.500 this
00:02:58.650 so
00:02:59.040 I
00:02:59.330 have
00:03:00.330 whole-wheat
00:03:00.720 pita
00:03:00.900 bread

00:03:01.200 because
00:03:01.410 I
00:03:01.500 like
00:03:01.680 to
00:03:01.800 use
00:03:01.830 whole
00:03:02.070 wheat
00:03:02.130 if

00:03:02.430 you're
00:03:02.550 a
00:03:02.580 low-carb
00:03:03.060 person
00:03:03.450 you
00:03:04.080 can
00:03:04.290 use

00:03:04.500 sprouted
00:03:05.100 tortillas
00:03:05.700 if
00:03:06.000 you
00:03:06.360 want
00:03:06.540 for
00:03:06.810 a

00:03:06.870 change
00:03:07.170 so
00:03:07.830 I
00:03:07.860 have
00:03:08.340 a
00:03:08.370 whole
00:03:08.850 wheat
00:03:09.090 pita

00:03:09.660 bread
00:03:09.930 that's
00:03:10.080 been
00:03:10.170 cut
00:03:10.470 into
00:03:10.590 squares
00:03:10.830 and

00:03:12.110 actually
00:03:13.110 stale
00:03:13.380 bread
00:03:13.620 works
00:03:13.860 better
00:03:14.130 it

00:03:14.340 turns
00:03:14.550 out
00:03:14.700 crispier
00:03:15.120 in
00:03:15.270 the
00:03:15.360 oven
00:03:15.630 and
00:03:16.200 I'm

00:03:16.890 going
00:03:17.160 to
00:03:17.250 put
00:03:17.489 actually
00:03:18.150 a
00:03:18.180 little
00:03:19.170 bit
00:03:19.320 of

00:03:19.590 garlic
00:03:20.160 powder
00:03:20.190 too
00:03:20.790 to
00:03:21.000 season
00:03:21.360 it
00:03:21.450 and
00:03:21.630 salt

00:03:22.020 so
00:03:22.680 here's
00:03:23.010 some
00:03:23.220 salt
00:03:23.580 just
00:03:24.530 put
00:03:25.530 some
00:03:26.150 on

00:03:27.150 there
00:03:27.600 I
00:03:27.840 have
00:03:28.560 some
00:03:28.830 garlic
00:03:29.040 powder
00:03:29.220 in
00:03:29.700 here

00:03:29.910 I
00:03:29.970 believe
00:03:30.360 yes
00:03:31.170 I
00:03:31.350 do
00:03:31.760 so
00:03:32.760 here's
00:03:33.150 some
00:03:33.330 garlic

00:03:33.570 powder
00:03:33.720 just
00:03:34.680 a
00:03:34.830 little
00:03:35.070 sprinkle
00:03:35.519 you
00:03:35.730 don't

00:03:35.880 want
00:03:36.000 to
00:03:36.090 drown
00:03:36.720 the
00:03:36.930 stuff
00:03:37.140 in
00:03:37.260 garlic
00:03:37.590 powder

00:03:37.799 and
00:03:38.810 some
00:03:39.810 olive
00:03:40.170 oil
00:03:40.290 about
00:03:40.530 two
00:03:40.860 tablespoons

00:03:41.250 now
00:03:41.790 traditionally
00:03:42.510 this
00:03:42.690 salad
00:03:43.230 was
00:03:43.799 made
00:03:44.130 by

00:03:45.140 deep-frying
00:03:46.140 the
00:03:46.560 bread
00:03:46.799 but
00:03:47.489 what
00:03:47.700 is
00:03:47.820 the

00:03:47.940 point
00:03:48.150 of
00:03:48.209 eating
00:03:48.570 the
00:03:48.690 salad
00:03:48.959 if
00:03:49.500 you
00:03:49.709 are

00:03:49.890 going
00:03:50.130 to
00:03:50.220 deep
00:03:50.430 fry
00:03:50.459 the
00:03:50.730 bread
00:03:51.090 right
00:03:51.390 I
00:03:51.420 mean

00:03:51.660 you
00:03:51.810 want
00:03:51.989 this
00:03:52.170 to
00:03:52.380 be
00:03:52.410 a
00:03:52.769 healthy
00:03:53.400 salad
00:03:53.640 so

00:03:54.060 this
00:03:54.209 is
00:03:54.360 my
00:03:54.540 adaptation
00:03:55.440 my
00:03:55.590 modern

00:03:55.860 adaptation
00:03:56.730 of
00:03:56.850 the
00:03:56.940 salad
00:03:57.360 and
00:03:57.510 it
00:03:58.170 actually

00:03:58.410 don't
00:03:58.860 sacrifice
00:03:59.430 flavor
00:03:59.760 so
00:04:00.420 I'm
00:04:00.630 just

00:04:00.840 stirring
00:04:01.079 this
00:04:01.320 up
00:04:01.380 and
00:04:01.950 I'm
00:04:02.940 just
00:04:03.239 going
00:04:03.390 to

00:04:03.420 put
00:04:03.630 this
00:04:03.750 in
00:04:03.930 a
00:04:04.019 pan
00:04:04.260 and
00:04:04.650 I'm
00:04:05.010 going
00:04:05.370 to
00:04:06.230 bake

00:04:07.230 it
00:04:08.180 until
00:04:09.180 it's
00:04:09.360 browned
00:04:09.690 and
00:04:09.959 crispy
00:04:10.440 so
00:04:10.650 here

00:04:11.340 we
00:04:11.459 are
00:04:11.489 we're
00:04:11.820 going
00:04:11.850 to
00:04:11.970 put
00:04:12.209 this
00:04:12.329 in
00:04:12.540 a
00:04:12.600 nice

00:04:12.780 sheet
00:04:17.150 and
00:04:18.150 I
00:04:18.840 have
00:04:18.959 the
00:04:19.049 oven
00:04:19.290 set
00:04:19.350 for
00:04:19.739 400

00:04:20.700 degrees
00:04:21.000 and
00:04:21.030 it
00:04:21.390 only
00:04:21.570 takes
00:04:21.959 about
00:04:22.320 6

00:04:23.190 minutes
00:04:23.460 to
00:04:23.760 cook
00:04:23.940 up
00:04:24.150 nice
00:04:24.570 and
00:04:24.840 brown
00:04:25.020 so
00:04:25.290 I'm

00:04:25.380 going
00:04:25.530 to
00:04:25.560 just
00:04:25.710 put
00:04:25.860 this
00:04:25.950 in
00:04:26.100 the
00:04:26.130 oven
00:04:26.220 right

00:04:30.230 okay
00:04:30.620 so
00:04:30.680 my
00:04:31.070 croutons
00:04:31.340 are
00:04:31.850 nice
00:04:32.090 and
00:04:32.360 crispy

00:04:32.870 now
00:04:33.380 you
00:04:33.440 can
00:04:33.860 use
00:04:34.070 store-bought
00:04:34.460 pita
00:04:34.970 chips

00:04:35.270 if
00:04:35.450 you
00:04:35.570 want
00:04:35.780 but
00:04:36.050 why
00:04:36.440 bother
00:04:36.680 if
00:04:36.890 you
00:04:37.070 can

00:04:37.250 make
00:04:37.400 it
00:04:37.550 so
00:04:37.730 quickly
00:04:38.090 and
00:04:38.150 easily
00:04:38.390 at
00:04:38.690 home
00:04:38.720 a

00:04:39.170 lot
00:04:39.560 of
00:04:39.650 other
00:04:39.770 times
00:04:39.980 those
00:04:40.220 pita
00:04:40.460 chips
00:04:40.730 have

00:04:40.940 a
00:04:40.970 lot
00:04:41.240 of
00:04:41.270 funky
00:04:42.110 oils
00:04:42.440 in
00:04:42.560 there
00:04:42.740 that
00:04:42.950 I

00:04:42.980 wouldn't
00:04:43.340 want
00:04:43.520 putting
00:04:43.910 it
00:04:44.030 in
00:04:44.210 my
00:04:44.240 food
00:04:44.690 and

00:04:44.960 they
00:04:45.350 also
00:04:45.500 put
00:04:45.770 too
00:04:45.890 much
00:04:46.040 sodium
00:04:46.340 so
00:04:46.700 this

00:04:46.850 way
00:04:47.000 I
00:04:47.030 can
00:04:47.330 control
00:04:47.600 how
00:04:47.780 much
00:04:47.810 sodium
00:04:48.140 how

00:04:48.500 much
00:04:48.650 fat
00:04:48.920 goes
00:04:49.190 into
00:04:49.430 my
00:04:49.550 croutons
00:04:49.760 so
00:04:50.660 that's

00:04:51.020 that
00:04:51.380 now
00:04:51.800 we're
00:04:52.160 going
00:04:52.250 to
00:04:52.310 go
00:04:52.460 back
00:04:52.670 to
00:04:52.700 the

00:04:52.970 salad
00:04:53.210 we're
00:04:53.420 going
00:04:53.540 to
00:04:53.600 make
00:04:53.720 the
00:04:53.840 dressing

00:04:54.140 it's
00:04:54.950 just
00:04:55.160 so
00:04:55.580 easy
00:04:55.850 it's
00:04:56.120 ridiculous

00:04:56.690 basically
00:04:57.560 I've
00:04:57.680 got
00:04:57.740 the
00:04:58.070 juice
00:04:58.280 of
00:04:58.460 one

00:04:58.520 lemon
00:04:58.820 already
00:04:59.240 squeezed
00:04:59.690 into
00:04:59.900 this
00:05:00.110 bowl

00:05:00.410 I'm
00:05:00.980 going
00:05:01.220 to
00:05:01.280 add
00:05:01.370 about
00:05:01.580 two
00:05:01.970 tablespoons

00:05:02.000 of
00:05:02.840 olive
00:05:03.020 oil
00:05:03.320 and
00:05:04.750 to
00:05:05.750 that
00:05:05.960 I'm
00:05:06.260 going
00:05:06.410 to

00:05:06.500 add
00:05:06.620 some
00:05:07.040 Mac
00:05:07.280 now
00:05:07.640 so
00:05:07.940 Mac
00:05:08.150 is
00:05:08.360 that

00:05:08.390 beautiful
00:05:09.250 purple
00:05:10.250 spice
00:05:10.760 that's
00:05:11.090 made
00:05:11.360 from

00:05:11.570 a
00:05:11.750 berry
00:05:12.080 and
00:05:12.410 it
00:05:12.650 gives
00:05:12.830 it
00:05:12.950 a
00:05:13.040 nice
00:05:13.220 tangy

00:05:13.610 flavor
00:05:14.000 so
00:05:14.720 I'm
00:05:14.780 going
00:05:14.930 to
00:05:14.960 add
00:05:15.080 that
00:05:15.320 and
00:05:16.310 I'm

00:05:16.520 just
00:05:16.670 going
00:05:16.820 to
00:05:16.880 whisk
00:05:17.060 it
00:05:17.560 doesn't
00:05:18.560 take
00:05:18.710 long

00:05:18.740 I
00:05:19.160 don't
00:05:19.310 need
00:05:19.460 any
00:05:19.610 fancy
00:05:19.820 contraptions
00:05:20.750 this

00:05:20.990 is
00:05:21.170 this
00:05:21.350 is
00:05:21.530 a
00:05:21.560 salad
00:05:22.040 dressing
00:05:22.130 folks
00:05:22.610 it

00:05:22.790 doesn't
00:05:22.820 get
00:05:23.180 simpler
00:05:23.540 than
00:05:23.750 this
00:05:25.000 so
00:05:26.000 the

00:05:26.240 sumac
00:05:26.540 is
00:05:26.750 really
00:05:27.020 what
00:05:27.170 makes
00:05:27.410 this
00:05:27.680 salad
00:05:28.520 a

00:05:28.610 lot
00:05:28.730 different
00:05:29.210 than
00:05:29.330 tabouleh
00:05:29.750 as
00:05:29.930 well
00:05:30.140 so

00:05:30.530 anyway
00:05:31.100 we're
00:05:31.460 going
00:05:31.550 to
00:05:31.640 add
00:05:31.790 this
00:05:32.060 to
00:05:32.360 the

00:05:32.620 vegetables
00:05:34.090 look
00:05:35.090 how
00:05:35.240 gorgeous
00:05:35.510 this
00:05:35.780 is
