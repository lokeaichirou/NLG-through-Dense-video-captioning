00:00:27.410 just
00:00:28.410 like
00:00:28.529 that

00:00:30.210 watch
00:00:30.449 for

00:00:30.750 a
00:00:30.779 couple
00:00:31.109 of
00:00:31.170 minutes
00:00:31.399 you'll
00:00:32.399 see
00:00:32.640 the
00:00:32.790 tub

00:00:33.030 as
00:00:33.390 the
00:00:34.350 bottom
00:00:34.800 of

00:00:35.010 heats
00:00:35.219 up
00:00:35.430 bubbles

00:00:36.210 will
00:00:36.420 appear
00:00:36.480 on
00:00:36.780 the
00:00:36.899 top
00:00:37.079 just
00:00:37.380 like
00:00:37.410 when

00:00:37.649 you
00:00:37.739 go
00:00:37.770 to
00:00:37.920 a
00:00:38.010 tenon
00:00:38.340 or
00:00:38.430 a
00:00:38.550 restaurant
00:00:38.760 and

00:00:39.540 they
00:00:39.660 bring
00:00:39.809 out

00:00:41.129 top
00:00:41.160 I've
00:00:42.000 actually
00:00:42.270 found

00:00:42.540 that

00:00:42.989 it
00:00:43.079 this
00:00:43.200 way
00:00:43.260 is
00:00:43.590 better
00:00:43.739 than

00:00:44.280 in
00:00:44.399 the
00:00:44.489 oven
00:00:44.640 now
00:00:45.260 it's
00:00:46.260 obviously

00:00:46.590 better
00:00:46.829 in
00:00:47.010 a
00:00:47.039 tandoor
00:00:47.520 but
00:00:48.620 if
