00:02:45.870 lay
00:02:46.470 everything
00:02:46.770 all
00:02:47.070 the
00:02:47.190 vegetables
00:02:47.580 out
00:02:47.700 on

00:02:47.880 a
00:02:47.910 baking
00:02:48.270 sheet
00:02:48.450 this
00:02:48.989 cools
00:02:49.440 down
00:02:49.650 the

00:02:50.010 filling
00:02:50.430 very
00:02:51.090 quickly
00:02:51.420 the
00:02:52.110 reason
00:02:52.470 why
00:02:52.560 this

00:02:52.620 is
00:02:52.860 important
00:02:53.340 is
00:02:53.430 because
00:02:53.459 if
00:02:53.760 you
00:02:54.000 try
00:02:54.209 to

00:02:54.239 use
00:02:54.600 hot

00:02:55.530 hot
00:02:55.830 filling
00:02:56.310 to
00:02:56.720 wrap

00:02:57.720 with
00:02:57.959 it'll
00:02:58.560 make
00:02:58.800 the
00:02:59.220 the
00:03:00.090 skin
00:03:00.450 of
00:03:00.660 the
00:03:00.750 egg

00:03:00.900 roll
00:03:01.200 really
00:03:01.650 soggy
00:03:01.950 also
00:03:02.610 another
00:03:02.820 tip
00:03:03.060 prop

00:03:03.630 up
00:03:03.840 the
00:03:04.350 baking
00:03:04.950 sheet
00:03:05.190 so
00:03:05.220 that
00:03:05.430 any
00:03:05.730 extra

00:03:06.390 oil
00:03:06.690 or
00:03:07.290 sauce
00:03:07.739 or
00:03:08.010 juices
00:03:08.190 collects
00:03:08.640 at
00:03:08.790 the

00:03:08.820 bottom
00:03:08.910 and
00:03:09.390 you
00:03:09.480 can
00:03:09.630 throw
00:03:09.840 that
00:03:09.989 away

00:03:10.080 discard
00:03:10.739 that
00:03:10.890 any
00:03:11.130 extra
00:03:12.030 liquid
00:03:12.390 this
00:03:13.019 helps

00:03:13.739 prevent
00:03:14.160 your
00:03:14.280 egg
00:03:14.790 roll
00:03:14.970 again

00:03:18.540 to

00:03:19.049 make

00:05:37.199 I'll
00:05:37.710 show
00:05:37.919 you

00:05:37.979 what
00:05:38.190 it
00:05:38.279 looks
00:05:38.460 like
00:05:38.669 it
00:05:38.819 should
00:05:38.849 look
00:05:39.210 tight

00:05:39.710 small
00:05:40.710 maybe
00:05:41.279 about
00:05:41.699 an
00:05:42.000 inch
00:05:42.270 and

00:05:46.469 lay
00:05:46.770 them
00:05:46.800 flat
00:05:46.949 on
00:05:47.340 a
00:05:47.400 baking
00:05:47.669 sheet
00:05:47.819 can

00:05:48.389 make
00:05:48.539 sure
00:05:48.690 you
00:05:48.810 covered
00:05:49.080 it
00:05:49.199 with
00:05:49.380 a
00:05:49.680 damp

00:05:50.039 towel
00:05:50.370 a
00:05:50.639 very
00:05:50.880 very
00:05:51.120 damp

00:05:52.380 wrap
00:05:52.860 to
00:05:53.039 prevent
00:05:53.370 them
00:05:53.580 from
00:05:53.610 drying
00:05:54.029 is

00:05:54.270 another
00:05:54.569 tip
00:05:54.840 if
00:05:54.990 you'd
00:05:55.110 like
00:05:55.259 to
00:05:55.500 freeze
00:05:55.800 them

00:05:56.130 freeze
00:05:56.940 them
00:05:57.240 just
00:05:57.690 like
00:05:57.930 this
00:05:58.199 or
00:05:58.469 just
00:05:58.529 make

00:05:59.159 sure
00:05:59.370 that
00:05:59.490 they
00:05:59.669 are
00:05:59.729 all
00:06:00.029 on
00:06:00.509 a
00:06:00.569 single
00:06:01.529 layer

00:06:01.740 try
00:06:02.520 not
00:06:02.699 to
00:06:02.909 have
00:06:03.029 them
00:06:03.240 touch
00:06:03.449 freeze
00:06:04.080 them

00:06:04.319 first
00:06:04.620 and
00:06:04.889 then
00:06:04.979 once
00:06:05.219 they're
00:06:05.400 frozen
00:06:05.669 you

00:06:05.940 can
00:06:06.120 gather
00:06:06.300 them
00:06:06.599 up
00:06:06.630 and
00:06:06.930 put
00:06:07.080 them
00:06:07.199 in
00:06:07.319 a

00:06:07.380 freezer
00:06:07.529 bag
00:06:07.770 if
00:06:08.130 you
00:06:08.550 try
00:06:08.849 to
00:06:08.909 squish
00:06:09.779 them

00:06:09.960 too
00:06:10.139 tight
00:06:10.409 or
00:06:10.710 have
00:06:10.979 them
00:06:11.159 overlapping
00:06:11.639 while

00:06:12.120 in
00:06:12.270 the
00:06:12.360 freezer

00:06:12.840 they'll
00:06:13.169 just
00:06:13.349 freeze
00:06:13.560 in
00:06:13.710 a
00:06:13.770 giant
00:06:14.099 clump
00:06:14.729 and

00:06:15.029 then
00:06:15.389 you
00:06:15.509 won't
00:06:15.659 be
00:06:15.779 able
00:06:15.870 to
00:06:15.990 get
00:06:16.139 them
00:06:16.289 apart

00:06:16.729 to
00:06:17.729 end
00:06:18.000 to
00:06:18.120 cook
00:06:18.300 them
00:06:18.479 frozen
00:06:18.930 all
00:06:19.080 you
00:06:19.380 have

00:06:19.500 to
00:06:19.620 do
00:06:19.800 is
00:06:20.039 put

00:06:23.490 very
00:06:23.729 careful
00:06:24.180 you

00:06:24.419 don't
00:06:24.900 need
00:06:25.169 to
00:06:25.319 defrost
