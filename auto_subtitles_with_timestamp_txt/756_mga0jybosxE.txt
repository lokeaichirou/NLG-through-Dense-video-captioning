00:02:26.590 those
00:02:26.800 little
00:02:26.980 white
00:02:27.190 things
00:02:27.459 on
00:02:27.640 top
00:02:27.790 that

00:02:28.030 mate
00:02:28.180 that
00:02:28.630 means
00:02:28.810 that
00:02:28.959 they're
00:02:29.110 fluffy

00:02:29.320 press
00:02:29.890 them
00:02:30.070 through
00:02:30.250 the
00:02:30.340 ricer
00:02:30.700 right
00:02:31.000 into

00:02:31.420 the
00:02:31.510 pot
00:02:31.690 look
00:02:32.290 at
00:02:32.380 that
00:02:32.560 so
00:02:32.980 fun
00:02:33.220 it's
00:02:33.370 like

00:02:33.430 using
00:02:33.730 one
00:02:33.850 of
00:02:33.970 those
00:02:34.090 play-doh
00:02:34.450 machines

00:02:34.989 right
00:02:35.580 this
00:02:36.580 is
00:02:36.730 already
00:02:37.120 nice
00:02:37.390 and
00:02:37.720 fine
00:02:38.250 so

00:02:39.250 you
00:02:39.340 can
00:02:39.519 just
00:02:39.700 stir
00:02:40.090 your
00:02:40.480 butter
00:02:40.720 one
00:02:41.260 thick

00:02:41.650 of
00:02:41.920 butter
00:02:42.190 make
00:02:42.400 sure
00:02:42.519 it's
00:02:42.670 room

00:02:42.820 temperature
00:02:42.850 so
00:02:43.390 it
00:02:43.510 melts
00:02:43.660 really
00:02:43.959 easily

00:02:44.470 I'm
00:02:44.980 gonna
00:02:45.250 break
00:02:45.670 it
00:02:45.820 into
00:02:45.940 little
00:02:46.090 pieces

00:02:47.140 it
00:02:47.410 pays
00:02:47.890 to
00:02:47.920 work
00:02:48.310 quickly
00:02:48.850 here
00:02:49.180 otherwise

00:02:49.630 if
00:02:49.989 your
00:02:50.260 potatoes
00:02:50.680 get
00:02:50.890 cool
00:02:51.130 your
00:02:51.400 butter

00:02:51.610 will
00:02:51.850 not
00:02:52.060 melt
00:02:52.330 so
00:02:53.200 just
00:02:53.530 stir
00:02:53.799 your
00:02:54.250 potatoes

00:02:54.760 until
00:02:54.940 the
00:02:55.180 butter
00:02:55.360 melts
00:02:55.450 and
00:02:55.959 then
00:02:56.440 you
00:02:56.620 can

00:02:56.799 add
00:02:57.040 your
00:02:57.070 warm
00:02:57.850 cream
00:02:58.269 and

00:02:59.680 can

00:02:59.860 start
00:03:00.100 adding
00:03:00.280 it
00:03:00.549 now
00:03:00.700 even
00:03:01.060 before
00:03:01.299 the

00:03:01.540 butter
00:03:01.690 is
00:03:01.780 completely
00:03:01.810 melted
00:03:02.260 and
00:03:02.680 of
00:03:02.830 the

00:03:02.920 warmth
00:03:03.250 of
00:03:03.340 the
00:03:03.400 cream
00:03:03.670 will
00:03:03.910 help
00:03:04.120 melt
00:03:04.299 the

00:03:04.480 rest
00:03:04.570 of
00:03:04.750 the
00:03:04.840 butter
00:03:04.989 I'm

00:03:06.850 cup
00:03:07.209 now
00:03:07.660 remember
00:03:08.140 you're

00:03:08.260 making
00:03:08.590 a
00:03:08.680 really
00:03:08.980 fine
00:03:09.549 sort
00:03:10.239 of

00:03:12.790 like
00:03:12.910 a

00:03:12.940 puree
00:03:13.360 so
00:03:14.140 if
00:03:14.350 you
00:03:14.530 were
00:03:14.650 interested
00:03:15.459 in
00:03:15.670 doing

00:03:16.000 this
00:03:16.239 and
00:03:16.420 you
00:03:16.510 really
00:03:16.870 wanted
00:03:17.170 it
00:03:17.350 extra

00:03:17.769 extra
00:03:17.799 fine

00:03:19.239 your
00:03:19.480 cream
00:03:19.750 you

00:03:20.380 could
00:03:20.560 pass
00:03:20.830 it
00:03:21.100 yet
00:03:21.549 one
00:03:21.880 more
00:03:22.090 time
00:03:22.330 through

00:03:22.720 a
00:03:22.750 sieve
00:03:23.110 so
00:03:23.890 that
00:03:24.040 it's
00:03:24.160 super
00:03:24.940 duper
00:03:25.540 silky

00:03:26.350 and
00:03:26.500 fine
00:03:26.769 I
00:03:27.090 am
00:03:28.090 going
00:03:28.299 to
00:03:28.420 forego
00:03:28.720 that
00:03:28.750 step

00:03:29.260 because
00:03:29.680 I
00:03:29.920 think
00:03:30.220 they're
00:03:30.370 super
00:03:30.760 fine

00:03:30.970 enough
00:03:31.269 having
00:03:31.630 passed
00:03:31.870 them
00:03:32.049 through

00:03:34.570 taste
00:03:34.870 it
00:03:35.049 I
00:03:35.230 think

00:03:35.410 you're
00:03:35.500 probably
00:03:35.620 need
00:03:36.010 salt

00:03:37.810 and
00:03:38.810 I
00:03:38.930 have
00:03:39.050 to
00:03:39.200 say
00:03:39.350 the
00:03:39.500 texture
00:03:39.800 of
00:03:39.860 this
00:03:40.010 is

00:03:40.070 good
00:03:40.370 and
00:03:40.550 I
00:03:40.670 don't
00:03:40.850 think
00:03:41.240 that
00:03:41.570 it
00:03:41.690 needs
00:03:41.870 any

00:03:42.050 more
00:03:42.140 cream
00:03:42.440 and
00:03:42.590 I
00:03:42.650 only
00:03:42.800 used
00:03:43.010 about
00:03:43.220 a
00:03:43.280 cup

00:03:43.520 so
00:03:44.150 don't
00:03:44.480 just
00:03:44.720 go
00:03:44.870 adding
00:03:45.320 all
00:03:45.530 the
00:03:45.680 cream
00:03:45.920 at

00:03:46.100 once
00:03:46.310 make
00:03:46.670 sure

00:03:47.060 a
00:03:47.090 little
00:03:47.330 bit
00:03:47.540 and

00:03:47.780 then
00:03:48.410 add
00:03:48.590 more
00:03:48.860 if
00:03:48.980 you
00:03:49.070 feel
00:03:49.250 like
00:03:49.370 it

00:03:50.270 doesn't
00:03:50.570 make
00:03:50.900 a
00:03:50.930 lot
00:03:51.260 but
00:03:51.620 it's
00:03:52.460 super
00:03:52.970 rich

00:03:53.450 so
00:03:53.570 everybody
