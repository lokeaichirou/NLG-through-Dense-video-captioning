00:01:18.689 good
00:01:18.900 mix

00:01:19.830 for
00:01:20.460 my

00:01:20.580 next
00:01:20.820 trick
00:01:21.119 I'm
00:01:21.270 going

00:01:28.170 gonna
00:01:28.259 mix
00:01:28.439 that

00:01:28.590 together
00:01:28.710 stop
00:01:29.670 worrying
00:01:30.329 about
00:01:30.420 over
00:01:30.810 mixing

00:01:31.170 this
00:01:31.710 meatball
00:01:32.189 recipe
00:01:32.549 is
00:01:32.640 indestructible

00:01:33.060 so
00:01:33.750 I'm
00:01:33.900 not
00:01:34.020 saying
00:01:34.320 intentionally
00:01:35.159 over
00:01:35.430 mix

00:01:35.640 it
00:01:35.790 but
00:01:36.060 once
00:01:36.240 it's
00:01:36.420 mixed
00:01:36.630 stop
00:01:37.200 so
00:01:37.650 right

00:01:37.770 there
00:01:37.920 I'm
00:01:38.040 good

00:01:38.549 going
00:01:38.729 to
00:01:38.820 stop
00:01:39.030 and

00:01:39.299 begin
00:01:39.630 to
00:01:39.840 shape
00:01:40.140 the
00:01:40.409 meatballs
00:01:40.829 but
00:01:41.490 before

00:01:41.820 we
00:01:41.909 shape
00:01:42.150 them
00:01:42.329 I'm
00:01:42.420 gonna
00:01:42.540 need
00:01:42.689 you
00:01:42.840 to
00:01:42.869 line

00:01:43.229 a
00:01:43.259 baking
00:01:43.619 sheet
00:01:43.860 with
00:01:44.130 some
00:01:44.579 aluminum
00:01:44.909 foil

00:01:45.149 and
00:01:45.450 then
00:01:45.720 brush
00:01:46.020 it
00:01:46.049 lightly
00:01:46.409 with
00:01:46.649 oil
00:01:46.890 and

00:01:47.100 then
00:01:47.640 for
00:01:48.270 the
00:01:48.360 most
00:01:48.570 time-consuming
00:01:48.899 step
00:01:49.770 in

00:01:49.979 making
00:01:50.189 meatballs
00:01:50.700 the
00:01:51.090 rolling
00:01:51.570 except

00:01:52.290 we're
00:01:52.380 not
00:01:52.409 going
00:01:52.680 to
00:01:52.740 roll
00:01:52.860 we're
00:01:53.460 gonna

00:01:53.579 scoop
00:01:54.119 besides
00:01:54.780 being
00:01:54.990 fast
00:01:55.439 because
00:01:55.799 it's
00:01:55.979 no

00:01:56.159 chop
00:01:56.549 this
00:01:57.090 method
00:01:57.630 uses
00:01:58.049 a
00:01:58.079 scoop
00:01:58.619 instead
00:01:59.100 of

00:01:59.219 rolling
00:01:59.490 so
00:02:00.180 you're
00:02:00.299 just
00:02:00.450 going
00:02:00.570 to
00:02:00.600 take
00:02:00.750 one

00:02:00.810 of
00:02:00.990 these
00:02:01.140 small
00:02:01.409 sorbet
00:02:01.920 scoops
00:02:02.310 they
00:02:02.850 sell

00:02:03.180 them
00:02:03.420 at
00:02:03.509 every
00:02:03.719 kitchen
00:02:04.290 supply
00:02:04.649 store
00:02:04.680 and

00:02:05.280 by
00:02:05.610 using
00:02:05.939 this
00:02:06.270 you
00:02:06.329 can
00:02:06.719 scoop
00:02:06.990 a
00:02:07.140 whole
00:02:07.350 tray

00:02:07.740 like
00:02:07.979 that
00:02:08.190 in
00:02:08.369 about
00:02:08.520 five
00:02:08.849 minutes
00:02:09.179 and

00:02:09.539 you're
00:02:09.869 going
00:02:09.929 to
00:02:10.080 get
00:02:10.229 the
00:02:10.349 same
00:02:10.560 basic
00:02:10.770 shape

00:02:11.039 except
00:02:11.700 they're
00:02:11.819 going
00:02:11.940 to
00:02:12.000 have
00:02:12.120 extra
00:02:12.569 nooks

00:02:13.380 cranny's
00:02:13.920 which
00:02:14.130 is
00:02:14.280 an
00:02:14.400 advantage
00:02:14.790 all
00:02:15.450 right

00:02:15.570 ask
00:02:15.690 anybody
00:02:16.080 that
00:02:16.140 slices
00:02:16.590 sandwich
00:02:16.890 meat

00:02:17.070 surface
00:02:17.700 area
00:02:17.970 equals
00:02:18.030 flavor
00:02:18.960 okay
00:02:19.650 so

00:02:20.970 the

00:02:21.120 edges
00:02:21.180 in
00:02:21.540 fact
00:02:21.720 I
00:02:21.810 have
00:02:21.900 like
00:02:22.050 a
00:02:22.080 pet
00:02:22.350 nickname

00:02:22.680 for
00:02:22.830 him

00:02:25.080 through
00:02:25.260 the
00:02:25.290 grapevine

00:02:25.560 that
00:02:25.770 DMX
00:02:26.400 is
00:02:26.580 not
00:02:26.820 happy
00:02:27.300 about
00:02:27.390 that
00:02:27.690 but

00:02:28.200 that's
00:02:28.290 another
00:02:28.560 story
00:02:28.800 and
00:02:29.040 this
00:02:29.430 method

00:02:29.820 really
00:02:30.120 does
00:02:30.330 save
00:02:30.630 a
00:02:30.660 tremendous
00:02:31.470 amount
00:02:31.680 of

00:02:31.860 time
00:02:32.070 so
00:02:32.640 we're
00:02:32.730 going
00:02:32.820 to
00:02:32.880 scoop
00:02:33.090 all
00:02:33.240 that

00:02:33.390 out
00:02:33.570 it
00:02:33.750 should
00:02:33.930 fit
00:02:34.080 on
00:02:34.200 one
00:02:34.230 sheet
00:02:34.650 tray
00:02:34.920 once

00:02:35.730 they're

00:02:36.390 have
00:02:36.540 to
00:02:36.630 brown
00:02:36.870 them

00:02:37.140 this
00:02:37.530 can
00:02:37.770 also
00:02:37.980 be
00:02:38.340 a
00:02:38.370 time
00:02:38.640 consuming
00:02:39.000 step

00:02:39.420 some
00:02:39.870 people
00:02:40.110 fry
00:02:40.380 some

00:02:45.090 broiler

00:02:45.630 it's
00:02:46.200 going
00:02:46.380 to
00:02:46.440 take
00:02:46.620 like
00:02:46.770 half
00:02:46.830 the
