00:00:04.799 guys
00:00:05.040 this
00:00:05.490 was
00:00:05.700 a
00:00:05.879 requested
00:00:06.359 video
00:00:06.569 by
00:00:06.779 a

00:00:06.810 subscriber
00:00:07.290 I'm
00:00:07.950 gonna
00:00:08.189 show
00:00:08.370 you
00:00:08.429 guys
00:00:08.519 how

00:00:08.670 to
00:00:09.059 make
00:00:09.300 Korean
00:00:09.870 style
00:00:10.080 spicy
00:00:10.769 pork

00:00:11.309 aka
00:00:11.670 a
00:00:12.059 Superbowl
00:00:12.570 game
00:00:12.960 typically
00:00:13.620 we
00:00:14.250 just

00:00:14.670 stir
00:00:14.880 fry
00:00:15.179 it
00:00:15.240 with
00:00:15.599 spice
00:00:16.560 but
00:00:16.980 I
00:00:17.250 like
00:00:18.000 to

00:00:18.300 boil
00:00:18.690 it
00:00:18.930 first
00:00:19.260 to
00:00:19.650 drain
00:00:19.890 the
00:00:20.010 fat
00:00:20.250 out
00:00:20.550 so

00:00:20.970 it's
00:00:21.090 a
00:00:21.150 little
00:00:21.449 bit
00:00:21.570 healthier

00:00:27.060 I
00:00:27.150 slice
00:00:27.570 it
00:00:27.720 in
00:00:27.810 the
00:00:27.869 middle
00:00:28.140 so

00:00:28.170 it's
00:00:28.710 smaller
00:00:29.160 pieces
00:00:29.570 typically
00:00:30.570 I
00:00:30.599 don't

00:00:30.720 like
00:00:30.990 pork
00:00:31.260 I
00:00:31.439 use
00:00:31.619 chicken
00:00:32.009 so

00:00:35.309 dokie
00:00:35.610 so
00:00:35.850 we
00:00:36.030 have
00:00:36.270 our
00:00:36.600 green
00:00:36.930 onions

00:00:37.320 and
00:00:37.680 regular
00:00:38.309 onion
00:00:38.730 I
00:00:38.879 will
00:00:39.120 list
00:00:39.360 the

00:00:39.690 specific
00:00:39.920 measurements
00:00:40.920 down
00:00:41.070 below

00:01:06.790 sake
00:01:07.150 this
00:01:07.690 actually

00:01:08.170 eliminates
00:01:08.890 the
00:01:09.220 smell
00:01:09.820 of
00:01:10.270 pork
00:01:10.810 when

00:01:22.060 bowl
00:01:22.630 to
00:01:23.290 mix

00:01:24.070 everything
00:01:24.430 up
00:01:24.640 later

00:01:36.460 mention

00:01:46.810 hot
00:01:47.440 pepper
00:01:47.770 flakes
00:01:48.130 if
00:01:48.460 you

00:01:49.210 guys
00:01:49.390 are
00:01:49.869 sensitive
00:01:50.770 to
00:01:51.040 spice
00:01:51.310 I
00:01:51.670 would

00:01:52.060 probably
00:01:52.270 use
00:01:52.570 six
00:01:53.170 or
00:01:53.350 seven
00:01:53.770 or
00:01:54.369 maybe
00:01:54.580 even

00:01:54.910 five
00:01:55.210 but
00:01:55.750 it
00:01:56.619 all
00:01:56.800 varies
00:01:57.220 on

00:01:59.979 the
00:02:00.850 brand
00:02:01.360 that
00:02:01.420 I

00:02:01.540 purchased
00:02:01.960 for
00:02:02.610 this
00:02:03.610 one
00:02:04.000 was
00:02:05.490 extremely
00:02:06.490 hot

00:02:06.759 and
00:02:07.149 I
00:02:07.300 didn't
00:02:07.570 know
00:02:07.660 about
00:02:07.780 it
00:02:08.020 until
00:02:08.530 after

00:02:09.570 well
00:02:10.570 even
00:02:10.869 when
00:02:11.020 I
00:02:11.050 was
00:02:11.380 cooking
00:02:11.920 the
00:02:12.310 pork

00:02:12.670 when
00:02:13.030 I
00:02:13.060 was
00:02:13.240 sauteing
00:02:13.720 it
00:02:14.020 I
00:02:14.340 knew
00:02:15.340 right
00:02:15.520 away

00:02:15.580 that
00:02:15.850 it
00:02:16.120 was
00:02:16.150 going
00:02:16.330 to
00:02:16.390 be
00:02:16.450 SuperDuper
00:02:16.870 spicy

00:02:17.560 because
00:02:18.060 my
00:02:19.060 nose
00:02:19.390 was
00:02:19.720 tingling
00:02:20.290 because
00:02:20.740 it

00:02:20.950 was
00:02:21.130 that
00:02:21.610 hot

00:02:31.160 okay
00:02:32.190 so
00:02:32.490 now
00:02:32.670 we're
00:02:32.880 going
00:02:32.970 to
00:02:33.030 add
00:02:33.240 one

00:02:33.690 tablespoon
00:02:34.380 of
00:02:34.620 hot
00:02:35.160 chili
00:02:35.459 paste
00:02:35.790 to
00:02:36.180 our
00:02:36.800 hot

00:02:37.800 pepper
00:02:38.250 flakes

00:03:01.880 now
00:03:02.510 we
00:03:02.570 have
00:03:02.960 to
00:03:03.110 add
00:03:03.230 five
00:03:03.710 tablespoons
00:03:04.340 of

00:03:05.180 low-sodium
00:03:05.990 soy
00:03:06.380 sauce
00:03:06.680 to
00:03:07.040 our
00:03:07.070 bowl
00:03:08.050 you

00:03:09.050 guys
00:03:09.230 can
00:03:09.410 use
00:03:09.560 regular
00:03:10.010 soy
00:03:10.220 sauce
00:03:10.520 if
00:03:10.730 you

00:03:10.760 want
00:03:11.180 you
00:03:11.570 guys
00:03:11.720 don't
00:03:12.050 have
00:03:12.110 low
00:03:12.500 sodium
00:03:12.800 but

00:03:13.280 I
00:03:13.580 prefer
00:03:14.240 low
00:03:14.420 sodium

00:03:26.819 so
00:03:27.000 now
00:03:27.180 I'm
00:03:27.239 just
00:03:27.450 going

00:03:33.780 distributed

00:03:45.330 all
00:03:45.960 right
00:03:46.200 so
00:03:46.410 now
00:03:46.590 it's
