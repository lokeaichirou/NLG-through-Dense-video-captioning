00:01:18.600 for
00:01:18.780 about
00:01:18.930 a

00:01:18.960 week

00:02:37.700 as
00:02:37.790 that

00:02:41.630 don't
00:02:41.780 deviate
00:02:42.110 too
00:02:42.260 much
00:02:42.500 from
00:02:42.710 the
00:02:43.420 from
00:02:44.420 the

00:02:44.450 two

00:02:46.100 and

00:02:46.280 cabbage
00:02:49.840 okay
00:02:50.840 so
00:02:51.290 I've
00:02:51.410 got
00:02:51.560 that
00:02:51.740 mixed
00:02:52.010 up

00:02:52.250 set
00:02:53.210 that
00:02:53.390 aside
00:02:53.709 now
00:02:54.709 if
00:02:54.830 we
00:02:54.950 use
00:02:55.160 two
00:02:55.880 heads

00:02:56.150 of
00:02:56.270 green
00:02:56.510 cabbage
00:02:56.930 will

00:02:57.350 with
00:02:57.380 green

00:02:57.709 sauerkraut
00:02:58.280 two

00:02:59.120 the
00:02:59.540 red
00:02:59.690 cabbage

00:03:00.110 will
00:03:00.290 have
00:03:00.800 a
00:03:00.830 nice
00:03:01.010 deep
00:03:01.370 purple
00:03:01.850 sauerkraut

00:03:02.420 but
00:03:02.870 you
00:03:02.990 can
00:03:03.140 find
00:03:03.410 that
00:03:03.620 you
00:03:03.860 combine
00:03:04.160 the

00:03:04.340 two
00:03:04.490 together
00:03:04.670 and
00:03:05.120 you
00:03:05.630 get
00:03:05.750 something

00:03:06.200 that's
00:03:06.320 just
00:03:06.760 lightly
00:03:07.760 pink
00:03:08.240 and
00:03:08.450 it's
00:03:08.540 really

00:03:08.720 quite
00:03:08.990 gorgeous
00:03:09.260 and
00:03:10.840 so
00:03:11.840 as
00:03:11.930 far
00:03:12.050 as
00:03:12.110 chopping

00:03:12.560 this
00:03:12.680 up
00:03:12.860 it's
00:03:13.010 really
00:03:13.220 quite
00:03:13.400 simple
00:03:14.080 we're

00:03:15.080 going
00:03:15.320 to
00:03:17.470 chop
00:03:18.470 into
00:03:18.650 big
00:03:18.920 chunks
00:03:19.180 discarding

00:03:20.180 the
00:03:20.270 core

00:03:35.840 that
00:03:35.990 coarsely

00:04:03.430 so

00:04:04.430 again
00:04:04.760 coarsely
00:04:05.300 chopped
00:04:05.600 into
00:04:05.900 the
00:04:06.140 food

00:04:06.320 processor
00:04:06.880 not
00:04:07.880 too
00:04:08.090 much
00:04:08.240 we
00:04:08.450 don't
00:04:08.480 want
00:04:08.720 to

00:04:08.780 overcrowd
00:04:09.230 it
00:04:14.020 doesn't
00:04:15.020 that
00:04:15.080 look
00:04:15.200 nice
00:04:16.450 okay

00:04:17.450 so
00:04:17.510 cabbage
00:04:17.989 is
00:04:18.109 all
00:04:18.230 chopped
00:04:18.500 it's
00:04:18.739 in
00:04:18.890 our

00:04:19.160 big
00:04:19.430 bowl
00:04:20.269 we
00:04:21.109 move
00:04:21.320 on
00:04:21.470 to
00:04:21.590 the
00:04:21.680 carrots

00:04:23.260 gorgeous
00:04:24.260 gorgeous
00:04:24.470 organic
00:04:25.460 carrots
00:04:31.510 so

00:04:32.510 that's
00:04:32.660 what
00:04:32.780 we're
00:04:32.930 looking
00:04:33.170 for
00:04:33.200 and
00:04:36.160 we

00:04:37.160 will
00:04:37.280 add
00:04:37.460 our
00:04:37.669 diced
00:04:38.270 onion
00:04:39.370 not
00:04:40.370 a
00:04:40.400 lot
00:04:43.330 and

00:04:44.980 our
00:04:45.980 diced
00:04:46.250 garlic
00:04:46.660 again
00:04:47.660 maybe
00:04:48.230 a
00:04:48.320 clove

00:04:48.669 onion
00:04:49.669 and
00:04:49.790 garlic
00:04:49.910 are
00:04:50.300 rather
00:04:51.110 powerful

00:04:52.390 ingredients
00:04:53.390 so
00:04:53.840 we
00:04:53.960 only
00:04:54.110 use
00:04:54.740 just
00:04:55.100 a
00:04:55.190 little

00:04:55.430 bit
00:04:55.580 just
00:04:56.120 to
00:04:56.270 add
00:04:56.419 that
00:04:56.630 little
00:04:57.350 underlying

00:04:58.160 flavor
00:04:58.640 which
00:04:59.390 I
00:04:59.540 like

00:05:06.770 and
00:05:07.569 toss
00:05:08.569 it
00:05:08.810 all
00:05:08.930 together
00:05:13.210 so
00:05:14.210 the
00:05:14.330 salt
00:05:14.599 is

00:05:14.750 going
00:05:15.020 to
00:05:16.389 draw
00:05:17.389 some
00:05:17.750 of
00:05:17.840 that
00:05:17.960 moisture
00:05:18.169 out

00:05:18.740 of
00:05:18.800 the
00:05:19.220 cabbage
00:05:19.669 the
00:05:19.699 cabbage
00:05:19.849 does
00:05:20.330 have
00:05:20.539 a

00:05:20.569 lot
00:05:20.810 of
00:05:20.840 moisture
00:05:21.430 so
00:05:22.430 does
00:05:22.610 the
00:05:22.759 onion

00:05:24.280 carrots
00:05:25.280 do
00:05:25.460 as
00:05:25.580 well
00:05:25.789 so
00:05:26.509 the
00:05:26.629 salt
00:05:26.870 will
00:05:26.990 draw

00:05:27.199 out
00:05:27.379 that
00:05:27.590 moisture
00:05:28.099 and
00:05:28.280 as
00:05:29.000 it
00:05:29.180 sits
00:05:29.419 in
00:05:29.599 that

00:05:29.720 croc
00:05:30.250 will
00:05:31.250 put
00:05:31.460 a
00:05:31.490 little
00:05:31.639 bit
00:05:31.819 of
00:05:31.879 weight
00:05:32.000 on

00:05:32.060 it
00:05:32.389 and
00:05:32.539 a
00:05:33.379 brine
00:05:33.680 will
00:05:34.039 start
00:05:34.310 to
00:05:34.430 form
00:05:35.020 and
00:05:36.020 we

00:05:36.110 want
00:05:36.319 that
00:05:36.379 brine
00:05:36.800 to
00:05:37.129 rise
00:05:39.009 above
00:05:40.750 the

00:05:41.750 vegetables
00:05:42.259 here
00:05:42.500 and
00:05:43.310 when
00:05:44.090 it
00:05:44.210 sits
00:05:45.460 there's

00:05:46.460 just
00:05:46.849 enough
00:05:47.150 salt
00:05:48.400 that
00:05:49.400 it
00:05:49.550 will
00:05:49.669 prevent

00:05:50.000 any
00:05:50.569 nasty
00:05:51.319 bacteria
00:05:51.530 from
00:05:51.979 growing
00:05:52.039 but
00:05:52.909 not

00:05:53.479 so
00:05:53.750 much
00:05:53.900 that
00:05:53.960 it'll
00:05:54.349 prevent
00:05:55.069 lactic
00:05:55.550 acid

00:05:55.970 from
00:05:56.150 being
00:05:56.360 produced
00:05:56.690 and
00:05:56.990 so
00:05:57.530 the
00:05:57.830 the
00:05:58.099 wild

00:05:59.110 airborne
00:06:00.110 bacteria
00:06:00.289 and
00:06:00.830 yeasts
00:06:01.250 will
00:06:01.400 start

00:06:01.639 to
00:06:01.759 work
00:06:01.940 away
00:06:02.270 at
00:06:02.449 the
00:06:02.659 at

00:06:03.199 cabbage

00:06:03.710 nettle
00:06:04.039 ferment

00:06:04.520 about
00:06:04.729 a
00:06:04.759 week

00:08:15.069 properly
00:08:15.189 and

00:08:16.800 into
00:08:17.800 Pickle
00:08:18.370 as
00:08:18.520 it
00:08:18.789 should
00:08:19.000 in
00:08:19.659 summer

00:08:20.050 months
00:08:20.409 when
00:08:20.530 it's
00:08:20.680 warmer
00:08:21.069 if
00:08:21.759 you
00:08:21.909 leave
00:08:22.060 it

00:08:22.120 out
00:08:22.270 at
00:08:22.419 room
00:08:22.539 temperature
00:08:23.020 it
00:08:23.050 might
00:08:23.379 be
00:08:23.500 done

00:08:23.680 in
00:08:23.860 five
00:08:23.889 or
00:08:24.250 six
00:08:24.460 days
00:08:24.719 but
00:08:25.719 we'll
00:08:25.810 probably

00:08:26.020 leave
00:08:26.289 this
00:08:26.469 for
00:08:26.710 about
00:08:26.800 eight
00:08:27.550 maybe
00:08:28.030 nine

00:08:28.120 days
00:08:28.539 and
00:08:28.870 check
00:08:29.740 on
00:08:29.889 it
00:08:30.009 periodically
00:08:30.400 like

00:08:30.849 this
00:08:31.120 this
00:08:31.360 is
00:08:31.419 again
00:08:32.019 why
00:08:32.200 I
00:08:32.229 like
00:08:32.560 using
00:08:33.130 the

00:08:33.370 clear
00:08:33.610 dish
00:08:33.880 and
00:08:34.209 the
00:08:34.329 pillowcase
00:08:35.050 I
00:08:35.260 can
00:08:35.380 just

00:08:35.500 kind
00:08:35.680 of
00:08:35.709 peek
00:08:35.890 underneath
00:08:36.159 it
00:08:36.459 and
00:08:36.550 just
00:08:36.700 see

00:08:36.940 how
00:08:36.969 everything's
00:08:37.450 going
00:08:37.829 so
00:08:38.829 when
00:08:38.979 when

00:08:39.820 those
00:08:39.940 eight
00:08:40.180 days
00:08:40.419 are
00:08:40.599 up
00:08:40.630 we'll
00:08:41.140 check
00:08:41.440 on

00:08:41.620 it
00:08:41.769 it
00:08:42.070 should
00:08:42.310 be
00:08:42.339 finished
00:08:42.820 there
00:08:43.000 might
00:08:43.120 be

00:08:43.149 a
00:08:43.269 little
00:08:43.419 bit
00:08:43.599 of
00:08:43.690 mold
00:08:43.839 on
00:08:43.990 the
00:08:44.140 top
00:08:44.320 but
00:08:44.500 we

00:08:44.560 can
00:08:44.680 just
00:08:44.800 scrape
00:08:44.980 that
00:08:45.190 off
00:08:45.250 and
00:08:45.700 we
00:08:46.540 can

00:08:46.690 store
00:08:46.959 them
00:08:47.140 in
00:08:47.170 large
00:08:48.040 glass

00:08:49.560 they
00:08:50.560 will
00:08:50.709 stay

00:08:51.190 fridge

00:08:54.760 eat
00:08:54.940 it

00:08:54.970 before
00:08:55.149 then
00:08:55.510 but
00:08:55.899 this
00:08:56.680 is
00:08:56.829 a
00:08:56.860 great
00:08:57.130 way
00:08:57.160 to

00:08:57.370 preserve
00:08:57.579 vegetables
00:08:58.329 they
00:08:58.779 really
00:08:59.079 do
00:08:59.649 last

00:08:59.920 a
