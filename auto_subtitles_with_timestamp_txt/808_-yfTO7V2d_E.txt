00:00:53.940 brings
00:00:54.180 out
00:00:54.390 that
00:00:54.449 tomato
00:00:54.989 flavor
00:00:55.350 you'll

00:00:56.010 need

00:01:05.369 tomatoes
00:01:05.790 obviously
00:01:06.299 you
00:01:06.360 don't
00:01:06.479 need

00:01:06.689 to

00:05:51.270 that
00:05:51.449 it
00:05:51.570 comes
00:05:51.780 up
00:05:52.050 to
00:05:52.229 a
00:05:52.260 bit
00:05:52.440 of
00:05:52.470 a

00:05:52.620 simmer
00:05:52.889 and
00:05:53.310 then
00:05:53.370 we
00:05:54.270 are
00:05:54.389 going
00:05:54.570 to
00:05:54.690 go
00:05:54.840 ahead

00:05:54.960 and
00:05:55.349 use
00:05:55.500 the
00:05:55.680 immersion
00:05:55.949 blender
00:05:56.130 now
00:05:56.699 just

00:05:57.630 before
00:05:57.990 we
00:05:58.110 get
00:05:58.229 there
00:05:58.530 I
00:05:58.740 just
00:05:59.010 want
00:05:59.370 to
00:05:59.430 be

00:05:59.490 careful
00:05:59.729 if
00:06:00.090 you're
00:06:00.780 using
00:06:00.810 an
00:06:01.199 immersion

00:06:01.620 blender
00:06:01.650 be
00:06:02.160 very
00:06:02.520 careful
00:06:02.970 make
00:06:03.090 sure
00:06:03.330 you

00:06:03.479 have
00:06:03.570 high
00:06:03.720 sides
00:06:04.080 because
00:06:04.530 if
00:06:04.680 you're
00:06:04.800 not

00:06:04.830 careful
00:06:05.039 it
00:06:05.760 could
00:06:06.240 splatter
00:06:06.630 everywhere
00:06:06.900 and

00:06:07.500 the
00:06:07.710 absolute
00:06:08.370 worst
00:06:08.669 thing
00:06:08.880 in
00:06:09.150 the
00:06:09.270 world
00:06:09.449 is

00:06:09.750 when
00:06:09.960 tomatoes
00:06:10.620 splatter
00:06:11.580 all
00:06:11.910 over
00:06:11.940 your

00:06:12.330 kitchen
00:06:12.510 it's
00:06:12.990 a
00:06:13.500 mess

00:06:14.230 and
00:06:14.320 it's
00:06:14.500 it's
00:06:15.070 such
00:06:15.490 a
00:06:15.520 disaster
00:06:16.330 so
00:06:17.020 try
00:06:17.500 to

00:06:17.530 avoid
00:06:17.770 that
00:06:18.010 so
00:06:18.400 I'm
00:06:18.700 going
00:06:18.910 to
00:06:18.970 go
00:06:19.150 off
00:06:19.300 camera

00:06:19.630 but
00:06:20.080 I'll
00:06:20.260 be
00:06:20.410 back
00:06:20.620 when
00:06:20.950 we
00:06:21.360 blend
00:06:22.360 it
00:06:22.540 all

00:06:22.630 together
00:06:22.810 so
00:06:23.500 I've
00:06:23.650 left
00:06:23.890 that
00:06:24.040 cook
00:06:24.430 for
00:06:24.730 a

00:06:24.790 little
00:06:24.970 while
00:06:25.320 I
00:06:26.370 covered
00:06:27.370 it
00:06:27.550 and
00:06:27.900 it's

00:06:28.900 looking
00:06:29.410 great
00:06:29.590 it's
00:06:29.950 thickened
00:06:30.430 up
00:06:30.580 a
00:06:30.700 bit

00:06:30.910 it's
00:06:31.720 got
00:06:31.930 an
00:06:32.080 amazing
00:06:32.170 tomato
00:06:32.920 smell
00:06:33.340 now

00:06:33.700 here's
00:06:34.480 the
00:06:34.750 thing
00:06:35.610 normally
00:06:36.630 actually

00:06:37.630 there's
00:06:38.050 a
00:06:38.110 few
00:06:38.350 options
00:06:38.470 normally
00:06:39.400 you
00:06:39.580 can

00:06:40.020 you
00:06:41.020 can
00:06:41.170 either
00:06:41.350 just
00:06:41.650 blend
00:06:42.100 this
00:06:42.280 as
00:06:42.550 is
00:06:42.790 or

00:06:43.570 you
00:06:43.630 could
00:06:44.110 go
00:06:44.320 and
00:06:44.500 Nick
00:06:44.710 pick
00:06:44.980 out
00:06:45.190 the
00:06:45.580 basil

00:06:46.300 leaves
00:06:46.480 I
00:06:46.860 personally
00:06:47.860 don't
00:06:48.100 mind
00:06:48.160 the
00:06:48.430 basil

00:06:48.850 leaves
00:06:49.000 left
00:06:49.330 in
00:06:49.510 it's
00:06:49.780 up
00:06:50.020 to
00:06:50.230 you
00:06:50.410 you
00:06:50.620 can

00:06:50.770 take
00:06:51.040 them
00:06:51.220 out
00:06:51.370 if
00:06:51.490 you
00:06:51.610 want
00:06:51.880 I'm
00:06:52.360 going
00:06:52.420 to

00:06:52.690 leave
00:06:52.870 mine
00:06:53.110 in
00:06:53.290 so
00:06:54.120 this
00:06:55.120 is
00:06:55.360 the
00:06:55.510 part
00:06:55.750 we

00:06:55.960 need
00:06:55.990 to
00:06:56.320 be
00:06:56.470 very
00:06:56.740 careful
00:06:57.190 about
00:06:57.280 and
00:06:57.580 I
00:06:57.820 am

00:06:58.000 just
00:06:58.330 praying
00:06:58.600 to
00:06:58.810 God
00:06:59.080 that
00:06:59.110 this
00:06:59.590 doesn't
00:07:00.010 go

00:07:00.130 everywhere
00:07:00.330 so
00:07:01.330 basically
00:07:01.960 you
00:07:02.140 take
00:07:02.380 your

00:07:02.560 immersion
00:07:02.950 blender
00:07:03.340 if
00:07:03.520 you
00:07:04.090 don't
00:07:04.360 have
00:07:04.480 an

00:07:04.570 immersion
00:07:04.810 blender
00:07:04.990 you
00:07:05.380 can
00:07:05.620 use
00:07:05.800 a
00:07:05.830 food

00:07:06.070 processor
00:07:06.130 and
00:07:07.050 we're
00:07:08.050 going
00:07:08.200 to
00:07:08.230 slowly
00:07:09.690 go

00:07:10.690 like
00:07:10.900 this
00:07:11.140 just
00:07:11.500 around
00:07:11.920 and
00:07:12.540 as
00:07:13.540 you
00:07:14.020 do
00:07:14.290 more

00:07:14.560 you
00:07:14.770 can
00:07:15.210 mix
00:07:16.210 it
00:07:16.450 longer
00:07:16.920 but
00:07:17.920 just
00:07:18.190 for
00:07:18.400 the

00:07:18.490 beginning
00:07:18.820 be
00:07:19.060 careful

00:07:21.860 and
00:07:22.860 you
00:07:23.310 just
00:07:23.490 want
00:07:23.730 to
00:07:23.820 keep
00:07:24.030 mixing
00:07:24.300 around

00:07:24.660 it'll
00:07:25.290 take
00:07:25.590 a
00:07:25.860 few
00:07:25.889 minutes
00:07:26.520 so
00:07:27.330 I'll
00:07:27.450 show

00:07:27.660 you
00:07:27.720 what
00:07:27.960 it
00:07:28.050 looks
00:07:28.230 like
00:07:28.380 once
00:07:28.620 it's
00:07:28.830 done

00:07:29.750 pureed
00:07:30.750 through
00:07:31.110 now
00:07:31.620 if
00:07:31.830 you
00:07:31.980 really
00:07:32.310 want
00:07:32.730 a

00:07:32.940 nice
00:07:33.180 smooth
00:07:33.780 cream
00:07:34.200 of
00:07:34.380 tomato
00:07:34.560 soup
00:07:35.120 or

00:07:36.120 tomato
00:07:36.570 soup
00:07:36.870 you
00:07:37.080 can
00:07:37.730 put
00:07:38.730 it
00:07:38.850 through
00:07:38.880 a

00:07:39.120 sieve
00:07:39.419 and
00:07:39.690 I
00:07:40.680 don't
00:07:40.980 usually
00:07:41.130 do
00:07:41.490 that

00:07:41.639 because
00:07:41.820 I
00:07:42.000 don't
00:07:42.270 mind
00:07:42.540 if
00:07:42.840 it's
00:07:42.990 a
00:07:43.110 little

00:07:43.320 grainy
00:07:43.620 but
00:07:44.130 some
00:07:44.430 people
00:07:44.730 are
00:07:44.850 very

00:07:44.970 sensitive
00:07:45.090 with
00:07:45.810 the
00:07:46.020 seeds
00:07:46.820 and
00:07:47.820 if
00:07:48.360 that's

00:07:48.510 you
00:07:48.840 that's
00:07:49.110 absolutely
00:07:49.350 fine
00:07:50.160 you
00:07:50.430 can
00:07:50.610 just

00:07:50.639 take
00:07:51.030 the
00:07:51.180 extra
00:07:51.510 time
00:07:51.540 to
00:07:51.889 strain
00:07:52.889 it
00:07:53.070 to
00:07:53.400 make

00:07:54.030 sure
00:07:54.240 you
00:07:54.389 get
00:07:54.570 all
00:07:54.750 that
00:07:54.780 out
00:07:55.190 don't
00:07:56.190 want
00:07:56.430 it

00:07:56.610 but
00:07:57.419 the
00:07:57.750 final
00:07:58.320 step
00:07:58.710 I've
00:07:59.160 preheated
00:07:59.840 the

00:08:00.840 stuff
00:08:01.050 a
00:08:01.080 little
00:08:01.290 bit
00:08:01.440 I'm
00:08:01.950 adding
00:08:02.340 in
00:08:02.460 about
00:08:02.669 a

00:08:02.700 tablespoon
00:08:03.660 or
00:08:03.750 so
00:08:03.810 of
00:08:04.050 parmesan
00:08:04.650 you
00:08:04.889 could

00:08:05.370 add
00:08:05.460 a
00:08:05.490 little
00:08:05.610 more
00:08:06.000 a
00:08:06.030 little
00:08:06.090 less
00:08:06.300 when
00:08:07.080 you

00:08:07.169 want
00:08:07.410 now
00:08:08.100 you
00:08:08.160 could
00:08:08.520 add
00:08:08.639 about
00:08:08.910 you
00:08:09.780 could

00:08:09.960 add
00:08:10.080 a
00:08:10.110 little
00:08:10.229 bit
00:08:10.410 of
00:08:10.530 whipping

00:08:18.419 dash
00:08:18.960 of

00:08:19.350 milk
00:08:20.389 and
00:08:22.070 this
00:08:23.070 will
00:08:23.310 make
00:08:23.550 it
