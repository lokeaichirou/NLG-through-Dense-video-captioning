00:03:28.180 I
00:03:29.820 like
00:03:30.820 dull
00:03:31.060 seaweed
00:03:31.480 the

00:03:31.630 best
00:03:31.870 there
00:03:32.140 are
00:03:32.320 other
00:03:32.680 seaweeds
00:03:33.190 out
00:03:33.370 there

00:03:33.580 and
00:03:33.820 dulse
00:03:34.180 is
00:03:34.390 not
00:03:34.570 the
00:03:34.720 one
00:03:34.840 that's
00:03:34.990 popular

00:03:35.530 with

00:03:40.930 digest
00:03:41.110 it's
00:03:41.680 easy
00:03:41.980 to
00:03:42.190 chew
00:03:42.460 and
00:03:42.720 I

00:03:43.960 it
00:03:44.050 has
00:03:44.170 a
00:03:44.200 great
00:03:44.500 flavor

00:04:05.020 that's
00:04:05.200 particularly

00:04:05.860 unique
00:04:06.070 about
00:04:06.460 this
00:04:06.670 miso
00:04:07.090 is

00:04:09.460 it
00:04:09.490 dissolves

00:04:10.120 pretty
00:04:10.390 quickly
00:04:10.660 into
00:04:11.230 the
00:04:11.350 soup
00:04:11.620 so
00:04:12.520 we're

00:04:13.150 going
00:04:13.210 to
00:04:13.330 add
00:04:13.560 several
00:04:14.560 scoops
00:04:15.040 to
00:04:15.430 the
00:04:16.030 soup

00:04:17.609 here's
00:04:18.609 what
00:04:18.820 you
00:04:18.910 do
00:04:19.060 not
00:04:19.269 want
00:04:19.570 to
00:04:19.630 do
00:04:19.780 you
00:04:19.930 do

00:04:20.049 not
00:04:20.200 want
00:04:20.440 to
00:04:20.500 have
00:04:20.650 your
00:04:20.799 soup
00:04:21.100 boiling
00:04:21.990 while

00:04:22.990 you're
00:04:23.140 adding
00:04:23.500 the
00:04:23.680 miso
00:04:23.980 paste
00:04:24.130 it
00:04:24.430 will

00:04:24.720 hurt
00:04:25.720 the
00:04:25.900 live
00:04:26.080 enzymes
00:04:26.290 in
00:04:26.770 the
00:04:26.800 miso
00:04:27.010 paste

00:04:27.310 and
00:04:27.640 it
00:04:27.820 will
00:04:27.910 actually
00:04:28.090 taste
00:04:28.510 burned
00:04:28.840 so
00:04:29.560 i

00:04:29.590 have
00:04:29.890 it
00:04:30.040 on
00:04:30.130 low
00:04:30.690 you
00:04:31.690 notice
00:04:31.960 i'm
00:04:32.080 adding

00:04:32.380 three
00:04:32.680 scoops
00:04:33.010 and
00:04:33.720 I'm
00:04:34.720 stirring
00:04:34.990 it
00:04:35.230 in
00:04:35.380 it's

00:04:35.860 probably
00:04:36.100 going
00:04:36.430 to
00:04:36.520 take
00:04:36.580 four
00:04:37.540 scoops
00:04:40.919 this

00:04:41.919 is
00:04:42.100 all
00:04:42.280 about
00:04:42.780 to
00:04:43.780 flavor
00:04:44.290 the
00:04:44.620 miso
00:04:44.919 paste
00:04:45.130 is

00:04:45.520 what
00:04:45.790 flavors
00:04:46.210 the
00:04:46.419 soup
00:04:46.950 now
00:04:48.600 since
00:04:49.600 it's

00:04:49.720 really
00:04:50.050 hot
00:04:50.320 I'm
00:04:50.650 going
00:04:51.130 to
00:04:51.220 turn
00:04:51.460 the
00:04:51.880 heat

00:04:52.150 off
00:04:52.330 the
00:04:53.490 heat
00:04:54.490 is
00:04:54.610 now
00:04:54.760 off
00:04:55.000 and
00:04:55.360 the
00:04:55.990 whole

00:04:56.230 idea
00:04:56.560 right
00:04:57.040 now
00:04:57.070 is
00:04:57.460 to
00:04:57.490 get
00:04:57.820 the
00:04:58.000 miso
00:04:58.330 paste

00:04:58.540 to
00:04:59.080 dissolve
00:04:59.500 into
00:04:59.800 the
00:05:00.490 soup
00:05:00.730 which

00:05:01.480 basically
00:05:01.930 means
00:05:02.520 constant
00:05:03.520 stirring

00:05:08.729 your
00:05:09.719 soup
00:05:10.050 should
00:05:10.259 have
00:05:10.469 a
00:05:10.499 slightly
00:05:10.979 brown

00:05:11.550 color
00:05:12.360 to
00:05:12.659 it
00:05:12.779 if
00:05:12.870 it's
00:05:13.050 a
00:05:13.139 light
00:05:13.439 brown
00:05:14.370 it

00:05:15.270 might
00:05:15.569 be
00:05:15.749 too
00:05:15.990 light
00:05:16.259 it
00:05:16.559 might
00:05:16.830 not
00:05:17.039 have

00:05:17.249 enough
00:05:17.370 flavor
00:05:17.759 you
