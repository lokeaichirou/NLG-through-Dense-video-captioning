00:00:19.090 so
00:00:19.449 you

00:00:22.420 bowl
00:00:22.480 you
00:00:22.810 can
00:00:22.960 start
00:00:23.259 off

00:00:23.410 by
00:00:23.589 putting
00:00:23.949 two

00:00:32.560 also
00:00:32.920 add

00:00:33.250 one
00:00:33.550 tablespoon
00:00:34.210 of
00:00:34.360 cumin
00:00:34.930 seed
00:00:37.680 saw
00:00:38.680 is

00:00:38.890 literally
00:00:39.250 the
00:00:39.460 preference
00:00:39.850 of

00:00:40.719 added
00:00:40.960 two
00:00:41.260 teaspoons
00:00:41.920 of
00:00:42.070 salt

00:00:42.309 and
00:00:42.579 this
00:00:42.730 then
00:00:43.329 we're
00:00:43.480 also
00:00:43.690 adding
00:00:44.199 a

00:00:44.289 quarter
00:00:44.649 cup
00:00:44.980 of
00:00:45.010 oil
00:00:45.250 as
00:00:45.760 of
00:00:46.690 right
00:00:46.809 now
00:00:46.870 you

00:00:47.050 want
00:00:47.289 to
00:00:47.320 go
00:00:47.469 ahead
00:00:47.590 and
00:00:47.829 start
00:00:48.070 mixing
00:00:48.280 and

00:00:48.579 you
00:00:48.670 want
00:00:48.879 to
00:00:48.969 mix
00:00:49.120 all
00:00:49.359 of
00:00:49.390 the
00:00:49.539 oils
00:00:49.930 and

00:00:50.050 everything
00:00:50.410 to
00:00:50.530 the
00:00:50.620 point
00:00:50.980 where
00:00:51.609 if
00:00:51.730 you

00:00:51.879 were
00:00:52.000 to
00:00:52.030 motion
00:00:52.629 in
00:00:52.750 your
00:00:52.870 hands
00:00:53.199 you'd
00:00:53.440 start

00:00:53.769 to
00:00:53.920 get
00:00:54.070 chunks
00:00:54.550 in
00:00:54.670 them
00:00:58.920 we
00:00:59.920 need
00:01:00.100 the
00:01:00.219 dough

00:01:00.399 to
00:01:00.460 be
00:01:00.699 hard
00:01:01.000 and
00:01:01.210 not
00:01:01.420 soft
00:01:01.809 so
00:01:02.019 we're
00:01:02.170 slowly

00:01:02.500 adding
00:01:03.129 water
00:01:03.339 to
00:01:04.150 what
00:01:04.360 we
00:01:04.660 want
00:01:04.989 to
00:01:05.080 do
00:01:05.199 with

00:01:05.379 it
00:01:05.590 once
00:01:06.370 out
00:01:06.580 of
00:01:06.700 the
00:01:06.760 flour
00:01:07.030 has
00:01:07.330 been
00:01:07.660 just

00:01:07.960 combined
00:01:08.440 together
00:01:08.680 you
00:01:09.430 want
00:01:09.580 to
00:01:09.640 go
00:01:09.760 ahead

00:01:09.820 and
00:01:10.030 start
00:01:10.210 kneading
00:01:10.420 this
00:01:10.750 on
00:01:10.990 a
00:01:11.020 counter

00:01:11.620 just
00:01:11.860 so
00:01:11.950 you
00:01:12.070 can
00:01:12.250 break
00:01:12.670 everything
00:01:12.850 down

00:01:13.450 completely
00:01:14.410 and
00:01:14.650 mix
00:01:15.040 everything
00:01:15.250 in
00:01:15.670 your

00:01:16.210 hands
00:01:16.630 and
00:01:17.590 this
00:01:17.920 is
00:01:18.070 how
00:01:18.190 the
00:01:18.250 consistency

00:01:19.210 should
00:01:19.240 look
00:01:19.690 if
00:01:19.900 you
00:01:20.380 can
00:01:20.560 get
00:01:20.680 a
00:01:20.710 wet
00:01:20.980 cloth

00:01:21.340 and
00:01:21.640 just
00:01:21.850 place
00:01:22.090 it
00:01:22.270 on
00:01:22.360 top
00:01:22.630 of
00:01:22.660 that
00:01:22.960 it'll

00:01:23.230 be
00:01:23.380 great
00:01:23.560 because
00:01:24.010 that's
00:01:24.250 going
00:01:24.430 to
00:01:24.490 avoid

00:01:24.940 it
00:01:25.030 from
00:01:25.150 getting
00:01:25.360 hard
