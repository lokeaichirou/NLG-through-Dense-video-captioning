00:00:17.460 may
00:00:17.970 have
00:00:18.180 heard
00:00:18.420 about

00:00:18.810 fermented
00:00:19.800 foods
00:00:20.010 they
00:00:20.310 seem
00:00:20.550 to
00:00:20.730 be
00:00:20.820 a
00:00:20.849 bit
00:00:21.029 of

00:00:21.119 a
00:00:21.210 trending
00:00:21.630 topic
00:00:21.960 at
00:00:22.800 the
00:00:22.920 moment
00:00:22.949 and

00:00:23.429 that's
00:00:23.910 because
00:00:24.269 most
00:00:24.689 of
00:00:24.900 us
00:00:24.990 have
00:00:25.320 a
00:00:25.619 pretty

00:00:26.070 poorly
00:00:26.910 sort
00:00:27.449 of
00:00:27.570 run
00:00:27.750 digestive
00:00:28.289 system
00:00:28.679 due

00:00:29.070 to
00:00:29.250 excessive
00:00:30.089 alcohol
00:00:30.769 consumption
00:00:31.769 coffee

00:00:32.160 consumption
00:00:32.700 and
00:00:33.030 antibiotics
00:00:33.810 especially

00:00:34.470 so
00:00:35.070 what
00:00:35.250 fermented
00:00:35.760 foods
00:00:36.000 do
00:00:36.270 is
00:00:36.510 really

00:00:37.080 really
00:00:37.500 popular
00:00:37.770 the
00:00:38.250 gut
00:00:38.460 so
00:00:38.850 really
00:00:39.270 allow

00:00:39.660 they
00:00:40.230 got
00:00:40.410 to
00:00:40.530 heal
00:00:40.770 and
00:00:41.010 allow
00:00:41.280 the
00:00:41.730 right

00:00:42.060 population
00:00:42.810 of
00:00:43.020 healthy
00:00:43.500 gut
00:00:43.710 flora
00:00:43.890 to

00:00:44.640 repopulate
00:00:45.210 that
00:00:45.840 gut
00:00:46.110 again
00:00:46.320 and
00:00:46.740 to
00:00:47.040 get

00:00:47.160 things
00:00:47.460 working
00:00:49.040 sauerkraut
00:00:50.040 is
00:00:50.340 a
00:00:50.370 really

00:00:50.910 simple
00:00:51.540 recipe
00:00:52.260 to
00:00:52.830 make
00:00:53.430 so
00:00:54.060 I
00:00:54.090 thought
00:00:54.360 that

00:00:54.510 that
00:00:54.540 would
00:00:54.720 be
00:00:54.780 a
00:00:54.900 great
00:00:55.170 one
00:00:55.320 to
00:00:55.530 start
00:00:55.800 with

00:00:55.920 because
00:00:56.220 it's
00:00:56.520 really
00:00:56.820 easy
00:00:57.500 everybody
00:00:58.500 can

00:00:58.710 do
00:00:58.860 it
00:00:59.040 it's
00:00:59.460 also
00:00:59.790 super
00:01:00.270 cost
00:01:00.600 effective
00:01:01.140 you

00:01:01.380 can
00:01:01.680 buy
00:01:02.130 sauerkraut
00:01:02.790 but
00:01:03.030 it's
00:01:03.180 quite

00:01:03.390 expensive
00:01:03.750 all
00:01:04.409 it
00:01:05.189 takes
00:01:05.549 is
00:01:05.820 a
00:01:05.850 cabbage
00:01:06.329 and

00:01:06.450 some
00:01:06.630 salt
00:01:06.899 so
00:01:07.380 I'll
00:01:07.979 take
00:01:08.250 you
00:01:08.310 through
00:01:08.490 the

00:01:08.820 process
00:01:09.030 today
00:01:09.390 and
00:01:09.689 hopefully
00:01:10.109 you
00:01:10.380 can

00:01:10.560 incorporate
00:01:10.859 this
00:01:11.310 into
00:01:11.609 your
00:01:11.759 diet
00:01:12.060 on
00:01:12.329 a

00:01:12.359 daily
00:01:12.719 basis
00:01:13.140 so
00:01:13.670 the
00:01:14.670 first
00:01:14.939 thing
00:01:15.270 that
00:01:15.509 we

00:01:15.869 need
00:01:16.140 is
00:01:16.640 a
00:01:17.640 cabbage
00:01:18.259 always
00:01:19.259 has
00:01:19.499 to
00:01:19.649 be

00:01:19.770 organic
00:01:20.450 organic
00:01:21.450 is
00:01:21.570 really
00:01:21.840 important

00:01:23.509 foods
00:01:24.509 that
00:01:24.810 are
00:01:24.929 not
00:01:25.079 organic
00:01:25.259 when
00:01:25.920 they

00:01:26.100 ferment
00:01:26.609 they're
00:01:27.030 basically
00:01:27.600 sort
00:01:27.899 of

00:01:28.020 increasing
00:01:29.009 that
00:01:29.189 toxicity
00:01:29.700 of
00:01:30.240 whatever
00:01:30.689 the

00:01:30.929 pesticides
00:01:31.439 are
00:01:31.619 that
00:01:31.829 are
00:01:31.920 present
00:01:32.280 on
00:01:32.369 the

00:01:32.399 food
00:01:32.700 so
00:01:33.240 organic
00:01:33.899 is
00:01:34.049 really
00:01:34.350 important

00:01:34.859 which
00:01:34.979 is
00:01:35.130 obviously
00:01:35.460 going
00:01:35.640 to
00:01:35.789 cost
00:01:36.060 a

00:01:36.179 little
00:01:36.299 bit
00:01:36.450 more
00:01:36.569 but
00:01:37.289 it's
00:01:37.469 a
00:01:37.560 worthwhile

00:01:37.799 investment
00:01:38.189 for
00:01:38.700 your
00:01:38.789 health
00:01:38.969 so
00:01:39.270 a
00:01:39.569 cabbage

00:01:40.229 a
00:01:42.049 good-quality
00:01:43.069 fermenting
00:01:44.069 jar
00:01:44.310 is

00:01:44.579 important
00:01:45.149 and
00:01:45.270 the
00:01:45.539 one
00:01:45.689 that
00:01:45.840 I've
00:01:45.990 got
00:01:46.020 here

00:01:46.499 is
00:01:46.679 called
00:01:46.950 a
00:01:47.100 Fowler's
00:01:47.670 the
00:01:47.909 cola
00:01:48.409 you
00:01:49.409 can

00:01:49.619 use
00:01:50.009 like
00:01:50.759 the
00:01:50.939 the
00:01:51.299 clip
00:01:51.569 lock
00:01:51.840 jars
00:01:52.170 but
00:01:52.590 I

00:01:52.829 would
00:01:53.189 recommend
00:01:53.700 looking
00:01:53.909 into
00:01:54.210 a
00:01:54.420 Fowler's

00:01:57.359 quality
00:01:57.869 sea
00:01:58.109 salt
00:01:58.439 so
00:01:58.829 again

00:01:59.249 it's
00:01:59.850 really
00:02:00.179 important
00:02:00.659 to
00:02:00.780 get
00:02:00.959 a
00:02:01.170 good

00:02:01.409 quality
00:02:02.119 naturally
00:02:03.119 sourced
00:02:03.689 sea
00:02:03.990 salt
00:02:04.350 we

00:02:04.859 don't
00:02:05.069 want
00:02:05.310 any
00:02:05.840 refined
00:02:06.840 salts
00:02:07.709 they're
00:02:08.009 not

00:02:08.160 going
00:02:08.550 to
00:02:08.760 allow
00:02:09.210 the
00:02:09.270 fermentation
00:02:09.750 process

00:02:10.080 to
00:02:10.590 occur
00:02:10.920 adequately

00:02:12.569 then
00:02:12.810 you
00:02:13.680 just
00:02:13.890 want
00:02:14.159 some

00:02:23.129 we'll
00:02:23.969 have
00:02:23.999 a
00:02:24.180 look
00:02:24.420 so

00:02:25.019 what
00:02:25.560 we're
00:02:25.709 going
00:02:25.829 to
00:02:25.889 do
00:02:26.129 is
00:02:27.920 we're
00:02:28.920 going
00:02:29.040 to

00:02:29.159 start
00:02:29.430 with
00:02:29.700 chopping
00:02:30.599 the
00:02:30.900 cabbage
00:02:31.319 finely

00:02:35.239 and
00:02:36.239 by
00:02:36.420 the
00:02:36.480 way
00:02:36.769 be
00:02:37.769 careful
00:02:37.980 with
00:02:38.280 the
00:02:38.400 knife

00:02:38.579 otherwise
00:02:38.939 you'll
00:02:39.450 cut
00:02:39.870 yourself
00:02:39.959 like
00:02:40.409 I
00:02:40.560 did

00:02:40.620 so
00:02:41.489 I
00:02:41.519 find
00:02:41.999 the
00:02:42.150 best
00:02:42.359 way
00:02:42.599 to

00:02:47.040 recently
00:02:47.489 is
00:02:47.900 into
00:02:48.900 quarters
00:02:49.379 and
00:02:50.780 then

00:02:51.780 it's
00:02:51.989 easy
00:02:52.230 to
00:02:52.439 get
00:02:52.560 that
00:02:52.680 core
00:02:53.069 out
00:02:55.159 there
00:02:56.159 we

00:02:56.250 go
00:02:56.400 so
00:02:57.329 then
00:02:57.510 we're
00:02:58.230 going
00:02:58.439 to
00:02:58.620 chop
00:02:59.840 the

00:03:00.840 cabbage
00:03:01.079 you
00:03:01.530 can
00:03:01.739 use
00:03:01.919 a
00:03:01.949 mandolin
00:03:02.519 to
00:03:02.579 do

00:03:02.879 this
00:03:03.090 it
00:03:03.959 does
00:03:04.199 make
00:03:04.469 it
00:03:04.500 easier
00:03:05.010 so
00:03:05.639 you
00:03:05.699 want

00:03:05.909 to
00:03:06.030 you

00:03:11.040 for
00:03:11.069 those
00:03:11.370 fingers
00:03:14.120 so

00:03:15.120 hopefully
00:03:15.510 you
00:03:15.930 can
00:03:15.959 see
00:03:16.139 from

00:03:17.090 roughly

00:03:18.500 how
00:03:19.500 finely
00:03:20.040 you
00:03:20.519 want
00:03:20.699 it
00:03:20.819 to
00:03:20.970 chop
00:03:24.889 so

00:03:33.870 be
00:03:34.049 a

00:03:34.319 fairly
00:03:34.949 good
00:03:35.159 size
00:03:35.430 and
00:03:36.470 then
00:03:37.470 we
00:03:37.590 want
00:03:37.769 to
00:03:37.829 add

00:03:37.949 the
00:03:38.129 salt
00:03:38.400 so
00:03:38.759 the
00:03:39.090 salt
00:03:39.329 is
00:03:39.720 going
00:03:40.169 to
00:03:40.349 help

00:03:40.590 release
00:03:41.009 the
00:03:41.280 brine
00:03:41.549 which
00:03:42.180 is
00:03:42.419 going
00:03:42.750 to

00:03:43.019 allow
00:03:43.470 the
00:03:43.819 lacto-fermentation
00:03:44.819 process

00:03:45.750 which
00:03:45.959 is
00:03:46.199 providing
00:03:46.829 all
00:03:46.949 that
00:03:46.979 beautiful

00:03:47.430 bacteria
00:03:48.239 that
00:03:48.479 is
00:03:48.720 going
00:03:48.959 to
00:03:49.109 heal
00:03:49.349 ogre
00:03:49.879 so

00:03:50.879 the
00:03:51.599 rule
00:03:51.810 of
00:03:51.840 thumb
00:03:52.169 with
00:03:52.530 salt
00:03:52.889 is
00:03:53.220 that
00:03:53.639 you

00:03:54.090 want
00:03:54.389 about
00:03:55.040 2.5
00:03:56.040 to
00:03:56.370 3
00:03:56.609 percent
00:03:56.849 of
00:03:57.329 the

00:03:57.569 weight
00:03:57.870 of
00:03:57.900 the
00:03:58.319 cabbage
00:03:58.680 so
00:03:59.549 in
00:03:59.669 this
00:03:59.759 case

00:04:00.030 we've
00:04:00.239 got
00:04:00.269 about
00:04:00.810 20
00:04:01.620 grams
00:04:02.299 so
00:04:03.299 I've
00:04:03.389 weighed

00:04:03.599 that
00:04:03.840 out

00:04:11.789 so
00:04:13.699 probably
00:04:14.699 for
00:04:15.150 this
00:04:15.469 cabbage
00:04:16.469 which

00:04:16.680 was
00:04:16.889 about
00:04:17.130 800
00:04:17.940 ish
00:04:18.239 grams
00:04:18.810 I'm

00:04:22.490 then
00:04:23.490 I'm
00:04:23.699 using

00:04:23.909 probably
00:04:24.570 about
00:04:24.750 a
00:04:24.810 teaspoon
00:04:25.050 of

00:04:33.190 be

00:04:33.310 quite

00:06:22.720 bit

00:06:22.870 uncoordinated

00:06:33.880 so
00:06:33.910 we

00:07:06.360 obviously

00:07:20.950 you
00:07:21.070 might
00:07:21.250 have

00:07:21.370 been
00:07:21.580 touching
00:07:22.470 and
00:07:23.470 if
00:07:23.620 you
00:07:23.800 are
00:07:23.950 squeamish

00:07:24.490 about
00:07:24.940 that
00:07:25.180 you
00:07:26.020 can
00:07:26.260 use
00:07:26.620 some
00:07:26.950 rubber

00:07:27.160 gloves
00:07:27.520 I've
00:07:27.820 obviously
00:07:28.000 got
00:07:28.300 a
00:07:28.570 rubber

00:07:28.920 finger
00:07:29.920 for
00:07:30.430 where
00:07:30.790 I've
00:07:30.910 cut
00:07:31.150 myself
00:07:31.330 but
00:07:31.810 you

00:07:31.960 can
00:07:32.140 use
00:07:32.350 you

00:07:32.860 well
00:07:33.190 fitting
00:07:33.670 rubber

00:07:33.880 gloves
00:07:34.210 but
00:07:34.540 I
00:07:34.840 think
00:07:35.800 you
00:07:35.950 know
00:07:36.720 there's

00:07:37.720 something
00:07:38.080 to
00:07:38.230 be
00:07:38.350 said
00:07:38.380 for
00:07:38.820 really
00:07:39.820 getting

00:07:40.600 in
00:07:40.930 contact
00:07:41.140 with
00:07:41.560 and
00:07:41.770 having
00:07:42.040 some
00:07:42.220 personal

00:07:42.700 connection
00:07:42.820 back
00:07:43.300 to
00:07:43.510 our
00:07:43.540 food
00:07:43.930 which
00:07:44.200 again

00:07:44.440 is
00:07:44.650 really
00:07:45.340 sort
00:07:45.850 of
00:07:45.910 playing
00:07:46.240 into
00:07:46.540 that

00:07:46.660 whole
00:07:46.870 paleo
00:07:47.290 piece
00:07:47.650 you
00:07:47.920 know
00:07:48.040 it's
00:07:48.220 about

00:07:48.280 getting
00:07:49.030 back
00:07:49.300 to
00:07:49.600 our
00:07:49.990 natural
00:07:50.290 roots
00:07:50.860 and

00:07:51.100 our
00:07:51.160 ancestors
00:07:51.790 always
00:07:52.060 fermented
00:07:52.840 food
00:07:53.080 and

00:07:53.380 they
00:07:53.890 always
00:07:54.100 use
00:07:54.460 their
00:07:54.670 fingers
00:07:55.090 and
00:07:55.210 hands

00:07:55.630 to
00:07:55.780 eat
00:07:55.960 and
00:07:56.260 and

00:07:57.730 prepare
00:07:58.030 their

00:07:58.210 food
00:07:58.240 and
00:07:58.720 so
00:07:59.260 I
00:07:59.290 personally
00:07:59.950 think
00:08:00.940 that

00:08:01.030 using
00:08:01.870 your
00:08:01.990 hands
00:08:02.380 is
00:08:02.500 the
00:08:02.830 best
00:08:03.280 way
00:08:03.490 to

00:08:03.850 prepare
00:08:04.810 a
00:08:05.020 really
00:08:05.470 good
00:08:06.120 healthy
00:08:07.120 robust

00:08:08.910 sauerkraut
00:08:10.380 okay
00:08:11.670 so
00:08:12.670 we've
00:08:13.030 got
00:08:13.180 lots
00:08:13.300 of

00:08:13.510 beautiful
00:08:13.750 brine
00:08:14.320 and
00:08:14.650 we're
00:08:14.800 going
00:08:14.920 to
00:08:14.950 push

00:08:15.190 that
00:08:15.220 down
00:08:16.200 so
00:08:17.200 that
00:08:17.410 it
00:08:17.530 covers
00:08:18.040 I'm
00:08:18.520 gonna

00:08:18.730 really
00:08:19.000 jam
00:08:19.420 it
00:08:19.600 in
00:08:19.750 so
00:08:19.990 that
00:08:20.020 it's
00:08:20.290 nice
00:08:20.440 and

00:08:20.710 tight
00:08:21.780 and
00:08:22.780 actually
00:08:23.200 that's
00:08:23.460 probably
00:08:24.930 the

00:08:25.930 right
00:08:26.170 height
00:08:27.000 you
00:08:28.000 want
00:08:28.120 to
00:08:28.300 leave
00:08:28.480 a
00:08:28.510 little

00:08:28.750 bit
00:08:28.990 of
00:08:29.080 room
00:08:29.290 because
00:08:29.710 when
00:08:30.100 it
00:08:30.310 starts
00:08:30.340 to

00:08:30.970 ferment
00:08:31.240 it
00:08:31.810 can
00:08:32.080 actually
00:08:32.560 start
00:08:32.890 to
00:08:33.040 bubble

00:08:33.280 as
00:08:33.580 you
00:08:33.700 can
00:08:33.850 see
00:08:34.060 here
00:08:34.360 there
00:08:34.540 is
00:08:34.570 a
00:08:34.690 little

00:08:34.990 bit
00:08:35.080 of
00:08:35.170 bubbling
00:08:35.650 going
00:08:35.950 on
00:08:36.210 so
00:08:37.590 you
00:08:38.590 want
00:08:38.800 to

00:08:38.980 make
00:08:39.160 sure
00:08:39.190 that
00:08:39.490 you
00:08:39.790 do
00:08:39.970 have
00:08:40.300 about
00:08:40.690 that

00:08:41.260 width
00:08:41.680 between
00:08:42.810 the
00:08:43.810 sort
00:08:44.170 of
00:08:44.200 the
00:08:44.380 top
00:08:44.590 of
00:08:44.740 the

00:08:44.860 brine
00:08:45.100 and
00:08:45.430 then
00:08:45.580 the
00:08:45.730 lid
00:08:45.910 so
00:08:46.870 now
00:08:46.990 we're

00:08:47.140 going
00:08:47.230 to
00:08:47.290 place
00:08:47.500 the
00:08:47.740 lid
00:08:47.770 on
00:08:47.950 so

00:08:49.020 particular
00:08:50.020 fermenting
00:08:50.800 jar
00:08:51.010 and
00:08:51.310 all
00:08:51.430 good

00:08:51.640 fermenting
00:08:52.180 jars
00:08:52.830 should

00:08:53.980 be
00:08:54.070 creating
00:08:54.639 an
00:08:54.730 anaerobic
00:08:55.120 environment
00:08:55.420 so

00:08:56.139 no
00:08:56.290 oxygen
00:08:56.709 that's
00:08:57.070 that's
00:08:57.490 the
00:08:57.850 idea
00:08:58.570 so
