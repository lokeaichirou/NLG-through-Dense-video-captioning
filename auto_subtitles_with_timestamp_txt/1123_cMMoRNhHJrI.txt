00:00:37.350 just
00:00:37.380 by
00:00:37.770 using
00:00:38.100 our
00:00:38.309 mini

00:00:38.520 chopper
00:00:38.790 thing
00:00:39.030 if
00:00:39.239 you
00:00:39.300 haven't
00:00:39.510 go
00:00:39.570 on
00:00:39.660 of

00:00:39.719 those
00:00:39.870 you
00:00:40.350 have
00:00:40.410 to
00:00:40.559 chop
00:00:40.739 away
00:00:40.890 a
00:00:41.190 lot
00:00:41.489 right

00:00:42.149 then
00:00:42.270 folks
00:00:42.390 here
00:00:42.719 we
00:00:42.780 are
00:00:42.809 with
00:00:43.230 a
00:00:43.260 lime
00:00:43.590 green

00:00:44.640 make
00:00:44.760 this
00:00:44.879 part

00:00:45.149 fails
00:00:45.390 I
00:00:45.719 think
00:00:45.899 that's
00:00:46.020 how
00:00:46.079 you
00:00:46.110 pronounce

00:00:46.230 it
00:00:46.680 but
00:00:47.309 some
00:00:47.460 plain
00:00:47.670 flour
00:00:47.700 we're
00:00:48.180 not
00:00:48.270 using

00:00:48.480 all

00:00:48.750 although
00:00:49.020 it
00:00:49.170 be
