00:00:19.700 make
00:00:19.820 some
00:00:19.880 hummus
00:00:20.360 this
00:00:20.630 is

00:00:20.780 the
00:00:20.900 most
00:00:21.050 traditional
00:00:21.260 and
00:00:21.740 basic
00:00:22.190 way

00:00:22.340 simply
00:00:22.850 using
00:00:23.180 lemon
00:00:23.540 garlic
00:00:23.780 chickpeas

00:00:25.460 salt
00:00:26.050 usually
00:00:27.050 tahini
00:00:27.680 is

00:00:27.950 included
00:00:28.490 which
00:00:28.670 is
00:00:28.700 just
00:00:29.090 ground
00:00:29.390 sesame

00:00:30.020 seed
00:00:30.290 book
00:00:30.619 that
00:00:30.830 adds
00:00:31.040 a
00:00:31.190 lot
00:00:31.340 of
00:00:31.490 fat
00:00:31.730 so
00:00:31.760 I

00:00:32.000 chose
00:00:32.300 to
00:00:32.510 leave
00:00:32.660 it
00:00:32.780 out
00:00:32.870 for
00:00:32.900 this
00:00:33.170 recipe

00:00:33.500 all
00:00:33.920 right
00:00:34.070 so
00:00:34.220 let's
00:00:34.400 start
00:00:34.490 by
00:00:34.790 opening
00:00:34.970 the

00:00:35.390 can
00:00:35.570 of
00:00:35.720 chickpeas
00:00:36.190 draining
00:00:37.190 out
00:00:37.280 the
00:00:37.400 liquid

00:00:37.610 and
00:00:37.940 then
00:00:38.059 setting
00:00:38.480 them
00:00:38.600 aside
00:00:38.900 for
00:00:38.930 a
00:00:39.230 minute

00:00:39.350 and
00:00:39.530 now
00:00:40.100 what
00:00:40.280 I'm
00:00:40.370 going
00:00:40.520 to
00:00:40.640 do
00:00:40.820 is
00:00:40.970 chop
00:00:41.270 up

00:00:41.300 the
00:00:41.629 garlic
00:00:41.660 simply
00:00:42.650 using
00:00:43.010 a
00:00:43.070 food
00:00:43.309 processor

00:00:43.340 if
00:00:44.120 you
00:00:44.330 don't
00:00:44.629 have
00:00:44.870 a
00:00:44.900 food
00:00:45.170 processor
00:00:45.800 or
00:00:45.830 a

00:00:46.010 blender
00:00:46.190 you
00:00:46.850 can
00:00:47.360 use
00:00:47.480 a
00:00:47.510 knife
00:00:47.809 to
00:00:47.989 chop
00:00:48.020 up

00:00:48.320 the
00:00:48.440 garlic
00:00:48.470 this
00:00:49.309 dish
00:00:49.580 is
00:00:49.820 traditionally

00:00:50.570 made
00:00:50.600 with
00:00:50.990 a
00:00:51.170 mortar
00:00:51.200 and
00:00:51.740 pestle
00:00:52.040 or
00:00:52.910 you
00:00:53.000 can

00:00:53.180 use
00:00:53.300 a
00:00:53.329 spoon
00:00:53.810 and
00:00:54.140 a
00:00:54.350 bowl
00:00:54.380 but
00:00:55.280 this
00:00:55.490 is
00:00:55.700 just

00:00:55.850 for
00:00:56.150 convenience
00:00:56.360 and
00:00:57.050 it
00:00:57.230 chops

00:00:57.860 a

00:00:58.040 little
00:00:58.220 bit
00:00:58.460 easier
00:00:59.140 all
00:01:00.140 right
00:01:00.290 so
00:01:00.440 once

00:01:00.650 you've
00:01:00.829 chopped
00:01:01.100 up

00:01:04.070 let's

00:01:04.699 just
00:01:04.910 set
00:01:05.089 that
00:01:05.239 aside

00:01:06.170 Samurai

00:01:06.680 chop
00:01:07.100 your
00:01:07.310 lemon
00:01:07.670 in
00:01:07.790 half
00:01:08.030 this
00:01:08.570 is
00:01:08.630 a

00:01:08.780 crucial
00:01:09.290 part
00:01:09.500 making
00:01:10.100 some
00:01:10.340 kind
00:01:10.550 of
00:01:10.729 ninja

00:01:11.450 move
00:01:11.660 before
00:01:12.110 you
00:01:12.200 cut
00:01:12.440 the
00:01:12.560 lemon
00:01:12.860 otherwise

00:01:13.160 your
00:01:13.340 hummus
00:01:13.640 will
00:01:13.880 not

00:01:14.360 right
00:01:14.420 all

00:01:14.899 right
00:01:15.020 so
00:01:15.140 now
00:01:15.259 we're
00:01:15.350 gonna
00:01:15.440 add

00:01:17.630 always
00:01:18.110 add
00:01:18.290 more
00:01:18.320 later
00:01:18.560 but
00:01:19.040 you
00:01:19.160 can't
00:01:19.520 take

00:01:19.759 it
00:01:19.820 away
00:01:20.000 give
00:01:20.600 it

00:01:20.780 few
00:01:21.020 quick

00:01:24.380 ahead
00:01:24.409 and
00:01:24.680 add
00:01:24.890 one
00:01:24.940 tablespoon

00:01:25.940 of

00:01:26.270 oil
00:01:26.540 again
00:01:27.530 you
00:01:27.680 can
00:01:27.860 always
00:01:28.070 add

00:01:28.370 more
00:01:28.670 or
00:01:28.700 less
00:01:28.909 depending
00:01:29.210 on
00:01:29.810 your
00:01:29.870 macros
00:01:30.380 or

00:01:30.530 depending

00:01:30.979 the
00:01:31.070 consistency
00:01:31.430 that
00:01:31.880 you

00:01:32.000 like

00:01:32.479 you
00:01:32.540 may
00:01:32.840 need
00:01:33.140 to
00:01:33.290 add
00:01:33.409 a
00:01:33.440 little

00:01:33.710 bit
00:01:33.860 of
00:01:33.890 liquid
00:01:34.159 I

00:01:34.940 just
00:01:35.180 add
00:01:35.360 water

00:01:35.690 so
00:01:35.960 I
00:01:35.990 don't
00:01:36.260 add
00:01:36.409 additional
00:01:36.890 calories
00:01:37.400 you

00:01:39.080 olive

00:01:39.590 oil
00:01:39.740 just

00:01:40.850 blends
00:01:41.119 up
00:01:41.330 a
00:01:41.450 little
00:01:41.690 bit

00:01:41.900 better
00:01:42.170 and
00:01:42.500 becomes
00:01:42.950 a
00:01:43.100 bit
