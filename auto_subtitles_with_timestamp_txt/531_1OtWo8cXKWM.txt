00:02:40.360 of

00:02:40.480 the
00:02:40.600 vegetables
00:02:40.780 and
00:02:41.170 then
00:02:41.290 you're

00:02:46.930 you're
00:02:47.050 gonna

00:02:47.140 finish
00:02:47.410 it
00:02:47.650 off
00:02:47.770 with
00:02:47.800 a
00:02:48.040 little
00:02:48.220 bit
00:02:48.370 of
00:02:48.460 that

00:02:48.610 chicken
00:02:48.970 stock
00:02:49.120 just
00:02:49.270 to

00:02:49.750 it
00:02:49.870 up
00:02:49.990 to
00:02:50.140 level

00:02:50.320 remember
00:02:50.950 because
00:02:51.310 this
00:02:51.459 is
00:02:51.580 a
00:02:51.670 slow
00:02:51.880 cooker

00:02:52.240 up
00:02:52.570 they're
00:02:53.110 going

00:02:53.440 be
00:02:53.500 some
00:02:53.740 liquid
00:02:54.190 that

00:02:54.340 naturally
00:02:55.000 happens
00:02:55.090 well
00:02:55.900 if
00:02:57.330 so
00:02:58.330 just

00:02:58.660 anticipate
00:02:59.170 that
00:02:59.320 you
00:02:59.470 don't
00:02:59.620 use
00:02:59.890 all
00:03:00.100 of
00:03:00.250 it

00:03:00.370 but
00:03:00.670 once
00:03:00.850 again
00:03:05.700 put
00:03:06.700 it
00:03:06.790 on
00:03:06.940 the
00:03:07.120 move

00:03:09.670 it
00:03:09.700 on
00:03:10.030 low
00:03:10.540 and
00:03:10.720 then
00:03:10.870 let
00:03:11.020 it
00:03:11.050 go

00:03:11.440 I
00:03:11.470 let
00:03:11.740 mine
00:03:11.920 go

00:03:12.430 my
00:03:12.670 complete
00:03:13.120 work
00:03:13.390 shift

00:03:13.660 okay
00:03:13.900 so
00:03:14.440 I
00:03:14.500 was
00:03:14.620 gone
