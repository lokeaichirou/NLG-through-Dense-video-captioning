00:01:40.320 little
00:01:40.440 dry
00:01:40.800 you

00:01:43.920 that
00:01:44.130 does
00:01:44.280 come
00:01:44.550 together
00:01:44.900 we're
00:01:45.900 then
00:01:46.020 gonna

00:01:46.170 need
00:01:46.500 it
00:01:46.650 now
00:01:46.800 if
00:01:46.890 you're
00:01:47.040 using
00:01:47.070 a
00:01:47.430 mixer
00:01:47.970 you

00:01:48.180 would
00:01:48.300 mix
00:01:48.540 it
00:01:48.690 for
00:01:48.900 approximately
00:01:49.620 four

00:01:49.950 minutes
00:01:50.160 on
00:01:50.490 medium
00:01:51.030 speed
00:01:51.270 until
00:01:51.900 the
00:01:52.050 dough

00:01:52.230 is
00:01:52.260 smooth
00:01:52.770 and
00:01:52.890 pliable
00:01:53.130 if
00:01:53.940 you're
00:01:54.060 using

00:01:54.210 your
00:01:54.510 hand
00:01:54.870 you
00:01:55.710 want
00:01:55.890 to
00:01:55.980 knead
00:01:56.160 it
00:01:56.190 for

00:01:56.340 approximately
00:01:57.180 seven
00:01:57.810 to
00:01:57.930 eight
00:01:58.080 minutes

00:01:58.320 again
00:01:59.040 until
00:01:59.640 the
00:01:59.760 dough
00:01:59.940 is
00:02:00.120 smooth
00:02:00.450 and

00:02:00.480 pliable
00:02:01.080 so
00:02:02.040 we're
00:02:02.190 almost
00:02:02.310 done
00:02:02.729 kneading

00:02:03.150 our
00:02:03.270 dough
00:02:03.510 but
00:02:03.870 as
00:02:03.960 you
00:02:04.050 can
00:02:04.170 see
00:02:04.350 the
00:02:04.470 proper

00:02:04.830 technique
00:02:05.280 is
00:02:05.550 to
00:02:05.820 use
00:02:05.850 the
00:02:06.240 prime
00:02:07.110 of
00:02:07.140 your

00:02:07.380 hand
00:02:07.650 kind
00:02:07.920 of
00:02:07.979 push
00:02:08.220 it
00:02:08.250 out
00:02:08.490 fold
00:02:09.030 it
00:02:09.210 over

00:02:09.360 and
00:02:09.630 then
00:02:09.780 roll
00:02:10.740 and
00:02:11.250 what
00:02:11.340 we're
00:02:11.490 really

00:02:11.520 doing
00:02:11.910 is
00:02:12.150 developing
00:02:12.450 the
00:02:12.810 gluten
00:02:12.960 here
00:02:13.320 in

00:02:13.410 the
00:02:13.530 dough
00:02:13.680 which
00:02:13.890 in
00:02:14.370 layman's
00:02:15.270 terms
00:02:15.330 just

00:02:15.750 makes
00:02:16.050 the
00:02:16.230 dough
00:02:16.380 strong
00:02:17.180 once
00:02:18.180 we're
00:02:18.360 done

00:02:18.540 with
00:02:18.720 that
00:02:19.250 we
00:02:20.250 then
00:02:20.280 are
00:02:20.459 gonna
00:02:20.700 put
00:02:20.940 it
00:02:21.060 in
00:02:21.180 a

00:02:21.270 bowl
00:02:21.560 now
00:02:22.560 we're
00:02:22.680 gonna
00:02:22.800 put
00:02:23.190 a
00:02:23.220 little
00:02:23.400 bit
00:02:23.550 of

00:02:23.670 olive
00:02:23.820 oil
00:02:24.090 in
00:02:24.590 so
00:02:25.590 we've
00:02:25.709 got
00:02:25.890 our
00:02:26.010 bowl
00:02:26.280 we

00:02:27.000 put
00:02:27.209 some
00:02:27.360 olive
00:02:27.630 oil
00:02:27.750 in
00:02:28.610 and
00:02:29.610 we
00:02:29.700 want
00:02:29.880 to

00:02:29.940 coat
00:02:30.180 the
00:02:30.360 dough
00:02:30.570 with
00:02:31.230 the
00:02:31.350 olive
00:02:31.680 oil
00:02:31.770 the

00:02:32.010 reason
00:02:32.340 for
00:02:32.580 this
00:02:32.760 is
00:02:32.970 so
00:02:33.150 that
00:02:33.180 the
00:02:33.420 dough

00:02:33.630 does
00:02:34.110 not
00:02:34.140 stick
00:02:34.320 to
00:02:34.770 the
00:02:34.860 ball
00:02:35.150 so
00:02:36.150 once
00:02:36.330 we've

00:02:36.510 got
00:02:36.540 our
00:02:36.810 dough
00:02:37.020 in
00:02:37.230 it's
00:02:37.650 coated
00:02:37.920 with
00:02:38.190 olive

00:02:38.220 oil
00:02:38.610 we
00:02:39.540 then
00:02:39.720 want
00:02:39.930 to
00:02:39.989 cover
00:02:40.230 it
00:02:40.380 with
00:02:40.410 either

00:02:40.680 a
00:02:40.860 kitchen
00:02:41.310 towel
00:02:41.520 or
00:02:42.000 a
00:02:42.060 piece
00:02:42.300 of
00:02:42.330 plastic

00:02:42.870 wrap
00:02:43.080 if
00:02:43.920 we're
00:02:44.130 going
00:02:44.220 to
00:02:44.280 let
00:02:44.400 the
00:02:44.550 dough
00:02:44.700 sit

00:02:44.970 at
00:02:45.090 room
00:02:45.120 temperature
00:02:45.269 it
00:02:45.870 will
00:02:45.930 take

00:02:46.110 approximately
00:02:46.260 two
00:02:46.950 hours
00:02:46.980 for
00:02:47.519 this
00:02:47.580 dough

00:02:47.850 to
00:02:48.720 proof
00:02:48.989 and
00:02:49.260 be

00:02:51.480 it
00:02:51.570 in

00:02:54.030 next
00:02:54.060 day
00:02:54.450 if
00:02:54.720 you

00:02:54.959 do
00:02:55.110 that
