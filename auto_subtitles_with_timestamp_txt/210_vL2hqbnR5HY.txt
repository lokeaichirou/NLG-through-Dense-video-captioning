00:00:55.420 take
00:00:55.600 the
00:00:55.750 longest

00:00:56.050 because

00:00:57.160 caramelizing
00:00:57.820 some
00:00:58.150 onions

00:00:58.510 so
00:00:59.350 into
00:00:59.589 a
00:00:59.620 pan
00:00:59.890 I'm
00:01:00.100 going
00:01:00.129 to
00:01:00.280 add

00:01:02.829 we're
00:01:03.550 just

00:01:03.699 going
00:01:03.820 to
00:01:03.850 let
00:01:04.030 this
00:01:04.180 cook
00:01:04.509 on
00:01:04.720 a
00:01:04.750 low
00:01:05.019 heat

00:01:05.100 it's
00:01:06.100 going
00:01:06.220 to
00:01:06.310 take
00:01:06.460 about
00:01:06.580 half
00:01:06.700 an
00:01:07.060 hour
00:01:07.240 or

00:01:07.390 so
00:01:07.570 guys
00:01:07.810 and
00:01:08.200 you
00:01:08.920 want
00:01:09.130 to
00:01:09.190 resist
00:01:09.460 the

00:01:09.640 temptation
00:01:10.180 to
00:01:10.210 stir
00:01:10.479 it
00:01:10.600 too
00:01:10.780 often
00:01:10.990 every

00:01:11.680 five
00:01:11.950 minutes
00:01:12.130 or
00:01:12.399 so
00:01:12.550 should
00:01:12.729 do
00:01:12.910 it
00:01:13.030 if
00:01:13.630 it

00:01:14.229 burn
00:01:14.380 turn
00:01:15.250 it
00:01:15.430 down
00:01:15.610 if
00:01:16.470 they
00:01:17.470 take

00:01:17.680 on
00:01:17.860 a
00:01:17.890 burnt
00:01:18.190 flavor
00:01:18.280 you
00:01:18.880 have
