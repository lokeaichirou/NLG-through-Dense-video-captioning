00:02:33.030 refrigerator
00:02:33.150 and
00:02:33.720 plunge
00:02:34.230 them

00:02:34.410 into
00:02:34.530 the
00:02:34.740 oil
00:02:34.770 otherwise
00:02:35.640 it
00:02:35.880 will
00:02:36.030 lower
00:02:36.240 the

00:02:36.360 temperature
00:02:36.510 of
00:02:37.140 the
00:02:37.290 oil
00:02:37.370 dramatically
00:02:38.370 and

00:02:38.610 your
00:02:38.760 wings
00:02:38.940 will
00:02:39.150 take
00:02:39.330 that
00:02:39.540 much
00:02:39.720 longer
00:02:39.930 to

00:02:40.140 cook
00:02:40.620 so
00:02:40.920 the
00:02:41.490 chicken
00:02:41.730 wings
00:02:41.880 are
00:02:42.030 nice
00:02:42.240 and

00:02:42.480 dry
00:02:42.630 now
00:02:43.140 you
00:02:43.200 want
00:02:43.410 to
00:02:43.470 work
00:02:43.620 in
00:02:43.830 batches
00:02:44.400 you

00:02:44.520 don't
00:02:44.700 want
00:02:44.820 to
00:02:44.910 throw
00:02:45.090 all
00:02:45.330 of
00:02:45.360 the
00:02:45.570 wings
00:02:45.780 in

00:02:46.020 at
00:02:46.140 once
00:02:46.410 because
00:02:47.130 it
00:02:47.220 will
00:02:47.340 lower
00:02:47.520 the

00:02:47.640 temperature
00:02:47.760 of
00:02:48.270 the
00:02:48.420 oil
00:02:48.450 and
00:02:48.959 the
00:02:49.680 grease

00:02:49.920 will
00:02:50.310 absorb
00:02:50.640 into
00:02:50.850 the
00:02:51.000 chicken
00:02:51.360 wings
00:02:51.510 and

00:02:51.690 that's
00:02:51.840 not
00:02:52.020 something
00:02:52.170 you
00:02:52.380 want
00:02:52.500 so
00:02:53.070 gently

00:02:53.910 place
00:02:54.270 the
00:02:54.570 wings
00:02:54.720 into
00:02:55.110 the
00:02:55.350 pot
00:02:55.560 and
00:02:55.920 that

00:02:56.370 rack
00:02:56.610 is
00:02:56.820 really
00:02:57.120 great
00:02:57.330 because
00:02:57.450 the
00:02:57.720 wings

00:02:57.870 do
00:02:58.110 sink
00:02:58.500 down
00:02:58.739 to
00:02:58.920 the
00:02:59.010 bottom
00:02:59.100 they're
00:03:00.060 not

00:03:00.209 gonna
00:03:00.390 rest
00:03:01.170 on
00:03:01.350 the
00:03:01.470 bottom
00:03:01.590 of
00:03:01.830 the
00:03:01.920 pot

00:03:02.100 they're
00:03:02.250 gonna
00:03:02.340 be
00:03:02.489 elevated
00:03:03.180 up
00:03:03.330 and
00:03:03.570 I'm

00:03:04.140 using
00:03:04.320 about
00:03:04.500 4
00:03:05.010 pounds
00:03:05.370 of
00:03:05.670 chicken
00:03:06.030 wings

00:03:06.180 total
00:03:06.780 try
00:03:07.440 to
00:03:07.500 fry
00:03:08.100 your
00:03:08.370 drum
00:03:08.670 s
00:03:08.850 in
00:03:09.239 one

00:03:09.570 batch
00:03:09.780 and
00:03:10.140 your
00:03:10.290 wing
00:03:10.470 ATS

00:03:10.800 in
00:03:10.920 another
00:03:11.160 batch
00:03:11.400 don't
00:03:12.090 mix
00:03:12.270 them
00:03:12.360 up
00:03:12.480 too

00:03:12.720 much
00:03:12.840 because
00:03:12.989 they
00:03:13.200 do
00:03:13.260 have
00:03:13.500 slightly

00:03:13.800 different
00:03:13.950 cooking
00:03:14.520 times
00:03:14.790 but
00:03:15.330 in
00:03:15.480 general

00:03:15.930 the
00:03:16.050 wings
00:03:16.230 will
00:03:16.470 cook
00:03:16.680 about
00:03:16.800 15

00:03:17.730 20

00:03:18.060 minutes
00:03:18.360 in
00:03:18.510 total
00:03:18.780 so
00:03:19.410 I'm
00:03:19.680 on
00:03:19.799 my
00:03:19.830 last
00:03:20.160 batch

00:03:20.489 of
00:03:20.519 wings
00:03:20.910 here
00:03:21.450 and
00:03:21.600 you
00:03:21.840 want
00:03:22.049 to
00:03:22.140 make
00:03:22.290 sure

00:03:22.320 that
00:03:22.620 when
00:03:22.769 you
00:03:22.890 pull
00:03:23.070 the
00:03:23.190 wings
00:03:23.340 out
00:03:23.610 of
00:03:23.640 the

00:03:23.850 oil
00:03:24.030 you
00:03:24.330 transfer
00:03:24.840 them
00:03:24.930 onto
00:03:25.200 a
00:03:25.440 wire
00:03:25.950 rack

00:03:26.760 don't
00:03:27.060 put
00:03:27.209 them
00:03:27.330 onto
00:03:27.480 paper
00:03:27.840 towel
00:03:28.170 because

00:03:28.350 what
00:03:28.650 that
00:03:28.769 does
00:03:28.980 is

00:03:30.150 contact

00:03:30.630 with
00:03:30.660 a
00:03:30.780 paper
00:03:30.959 towel

00:03:31.350 it
00:03:31.500 creates
00:03:31.920 scheme
00:03:32.459 and
00:03:32.730 one
00:03:33.030 side
00:03:33.299 of
00:03:33.420 your

00:03:33.720 will
00:03:33.959 get
00:03:34.110 soggy
00:03:34.440 so

00:03:35.100 a
00:03:35.130 wire
00:03:35.489 rack
