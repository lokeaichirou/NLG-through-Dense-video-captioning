00:01:55.759 overpower
00:01:56.119 the

00:02:06.380 the
00:02:06.619 chickpeas
00:02:07.130 to

00:02:07.879 finely
00:02:08.300 chopped
00:02:08.509 you

00:02:18.890 bit

00:02:19.129 of

00:02:20.510 court
00:02:20.840 case
00:02:21.140 would
00:02:21.410 be

00:02:21.560 good
00:02:21.800 description
00:02:22.069 and
00:02:22.700 as
00:02:23.030 I

00:02:28.310 pieces
00:02:29.980 mixed
00:02:30.980 in

00:02:34.860 then
00:02:35.860 one
00:02:36.160 last
00:02:36.400 clip
00:02:36.820 you'll
00:02:37.150 be
00:02:37.240 able
00:02:37.300 to

00:02:37.540 smell

00:02:38.050 the
00:02:38.620 spice
00:02:39.010 mixture
00:02:39.550 which

00:02:40.060 although
00:02:40.360 really
00:02:40.630 simple
00:02:41.260 is
00:02:41.640 got

00:02:42.670 great

00:02:43.000 kind
00:02:43.300 of
00:02:43.590 Ottoman
00:02:44.590 like
00:02:44.890 Moroccan
00:02:45.430 Persian

00:02:45.910 flavor
00:02:46.740 so
00:02:48.570 we
00:02:49.570 get
00:02:49.750 a
00:02:49.780 mixing
00:02:50.260 bowl
00:02:50.530 and

00:02:57.870 and
00:02:59.160 take
00:03:00.160 the
00:03:00.240 falafel
00:03:01.240 paste
00:03:02.230 which

00:03:02.680 is
00:03:02.860 what
00:03:02.980 it
00:03:03.100 is
00:03:03.220 at
00:03:03.430 the
00:03:03.520 moment
00:03:03.940 and
00:03:05.340 just

00:03:06.340 scrape
00:03:06.610 it
00:03:06.790 in
00:03:06.970 the
00:03:07.420 next
00:03:07.660 step
00:03:07.930 is

00:03:12.700 adding
00:03:13.120 a

00:03:13.210 flat
00:03:13.480 but
00:03:13.750 obviously

00:03:15.070 want
00:03:15.310 gluten-free

00:03:15.880 flour
00:03:16.360 and
00:03:16.660 this

00:03:24.430 you
00:03:25.390 can
00:03:25.570 also
00:03:26.010 use

00:03:27.820 mixtures
00:03:28.210 or
00:03:28.360 baking
00:03:28.960 but
00:03:29.470 of
00:03:29.560 course

00:03:29.890 perfect

00:03:33.700 gram
00:03:33.910 flour

00:03:34.180 I'd
00:03:35.170 say
00:03:35.710 three
00:03:36.670 to
00:03:36.790 four
00:03:37.240 tablespoons
00:03:38.020 but
00:03:38.590 it

00:03:38.710 really
00:03:38.980 depends
00:03:39.700 on
00:03:39.880 how
00:03:40.120 much
00:03:40.300 moisture
00:03:40.480 is

00:03:40.870 in
00:03:40.900 your
00:03:41.170 chickpeas
00:03:41.440 and
00:03:41.890 how
00:03:42.520 moist
00:03:42.820 the

00:03:43.030 mixture
00:03:43.360 is
00:03:43.450 so
00:03:43.840 you
00:03:44.380 want
00:03:44.620 it
00:03:44.830 to
00:03:44.980 be
00:03:45.160 bound

00:03:45.730 together
00:03:46.000 so
00:03:46.330 we'll
00:03:46.480 start
00:03:46.780 with
00:03:46.870 three
00:03:47.350 and

00:03:48.060 then
00:03:49.060 stir
00:03:49.420 together
00:03:49.780 and
00:03:50.050 see
00:03:50.260 what
00:03:50.440 kind
00:03:50.650 of

00:03:50.710 texture
00:03:51.160 it
00:03:51.280 is
00:03:54.960 you
00:03:55.960 just
00:03:56.230 want
00:03:56.620 it
00:03:56.890 to
00:03:57.520 still

00:03:57.790 help
00:03:58.120 be
00:03:58.330 slightly
00:03:58.720 tacky
00:03:59.380 but
00:04:00.070 hold
00:04:00.430 together

00:04:00.850 nicely
00:04:01.410 so
00:04:02.410 that
00:04:02.440 you
00:04:02.709 can
00:04:02.890 shape
00:04:03.190 it
00:04:03.370 into

00:04:03.700 little
00:04:03.820 patties
00:04:04.770 and
00:04:05.770 for
00:04:06.250 this
00:04:06.370 recipe
00:04:06.790 we're

00:04:06.970 going
00:04:07.000 to
00:04:07.150 bake
00:04:07.480 the
00:04:07.780 falafel
00:04:08.350 which
00:04:08.620 isn't

00:04:09.100 your
00:04:09.250 usual
00:04:09.459 option
00:04:10.120 normally
00:04:10.600 we
00:04:10.810 fry

00:04:11.140 fluffle
00:04:11.800 and
00:04:11.950 you
00:04:12.070 could
00:04:12.280 do
00:04:12.490 with
00:04:12.670 this

00:04:12.820 mixture
00:04:13.300 as
00:04:13.450 well
00:04:13.480 but
00:04:14.320 I
00:04:14.350 prefer
00:04:14.800 to
00:04:14.830 do
00:04:15.100 in

00:04:15.310 the
00:04:15.430 oven
00:04:15.640 I
00:04:15.760 think
00:04:16.030 it's
00:04:16.390 got
00:04:16.660 a
00:04:16.690 nice
00:04:16.930 flavor

00:04:17.350 and
00:04:17.670 although
00:04:18.810 looks
00:04:19.810 a
00:04:19.989 little
00:04:20.170 less
00:04:20.470 golden

00:04:21.010 tastes
00:04:21.580 just
00:04:21.850 as
00:04:22.270 delicious
00:04:24.060 so
00:04:25.060 that's
00:04:25.240 four

00:04:25.600 table
00:04:26.050 spoons
00:04:26.080 of
00:04:26.800 gram
00:04:27.250 flour
00:04:27.310 and
00:04:28.260 then

00:04:29.260 you'll
00:04:30.190 see
00:04:30.460 that
00:04:30.490 the
00:04:30.820 mixture
00:04:31.120 is
00:04:31.210 holding

00:04:31.780 together
00:04:32.190 but
00:04:33.190 still
00:04:33.370 a
00:04:33.520 paste
00:04:33.850 and
00:04:34.180 this
00:04:34.360 is

00:04:34.510 about
00:04:34.750 right
00:04:35.050 we're
00:04:35.800 taking
00:04:35.890 about
00:04:36.100 a
00:04:36.190 walnut

00:04:36.490 sized
00:04:36.970 amount
00:04:37.390 and
00:04:37.690 we're
00:04:38.140 just
00:04:38.470 going
00:04:38.680 to

00:04:38.800 you'll
00:04:39.070 see
00:04:39.130 that
00:04:39.430 it's
00:04:39.580 quite
00:04:39.760 tacky

00:04:40.980 that's
00:04:41.550 totally
00:04:41.910 fine
00:04:42.060 if
00:04:42.240 you
00:04:42.360 have
00:04:42.480 a

00:04:42.510 problem
00:04:42.780 with
00:04:43.020 it
00:04:43.110 just
00:04:43.260 all
00:04:43.500 your
00:04:43.680 hands
00:04:43.920 with

00:04:44.190 a
00:04:44.220 little
00:04:44.490 bit
00:04:44.610 of
00:04:44.640 olive
00:04:44.820 oil
00:04:45.060 and
00:04:45.330 that
00:04:45.840 will

00:04:45.960 help
00:04:46.110 them
00:04:46.350 slide
00:04:46.710 off
00:04:46.950 and
00:04:47.220 again
00:04:47.670 we're

00:04:47.820 going
00:04:47.910 to
00:04:47.970 put
00:04:48.060 them
00:04:48.240 on
00:04:48.360 an
00:04:48.480 oiled
00:04:48.930 baking

00:04:49.230 tray
00:04:49.940 to
00:04:50.940 cook
00:04:51.180 so
00:04:51.690 to
00:04:52.200 shape
00:04:52.440 it
00:04:52.620 into
00:04:52.740 a

00:04:52.920 little
00:04:53.850 ball
00:04:53.970 and
00:04:54.300 then
00:04:54.390 place
00:04:55.080 it
00:04:55.230 on
00:04:55.350 your

00:04:55.380 baking
00:04:55.830 tray
00:04:55.950 and
00:04:56.280 you
00:04:56.730 can
00:04:56.880 flatten
00:04:57.450 it

00:04:57.690 slightly
00:04:57.900 but
00:04:58.380 really
00:04:58.770 you
00:04:59.730 just
00:04:59.910 want
00:05:00.180 them

00:05:00.360 to
00:05:00.390 be
00:05:00.570 like
00:05:00.870 little
00:05:01.110 mini
00:05:01.380 patties
00:05:02.130 and
00:05:02.400 they

00:05:02.460 won't
00:05:02.670 spread
00:05:03.330 when
00:05:03.690 you
00:05:03.870 bake
00:05:04.350 them
00:05:04.620 so
00:05:05.340 you

00:05:05.400 can
00:05:05.700 put
00:05:05.820 them
00:05:05.940 quite
00:05:06.150 place
00:05:06.360 together
00:05:06.570 so
00:05:07.260 I'm

00:05:07.380 just
00:05:07.560 going
00:05:07.680 to
00:05:07.740 carry
00:05:08.040 on
00:05:08.220 making
00:05:08.370 these

00:05:08.670 falafel
00:05:09.240 until
00:05:09.660 we've
00:05:09.870 used
00:05:10.200 all
00:05:10.560 the
00:05:10.770 mixture

00:05:11.160 up
00:05:11.340 put
00:05:11.880 it
00:05:11.970 on
00:05:12.060 the
00:05:12.270 baking
00:05:12.690 tray
00:05:12.720 and
00:05:13.200 then

00:05:13.320 it's
00:05:13.470 into
00:05:13.680 the
00:05:13.860 oven
00:05:13.980 at
00:05:14.340 200
00:05:14.790 degrees
00:05:14.840 for

00:05:15.840 about
00:05:15.930 25
00:05:16.650 to
00:05:17.190 30
00:05:17.700 minutes

00:05:22.160 so
00:05:23.160 our
00:05:23.490 falafel
00:05:24.060 are
00:05:24.150 out
00:05:24.330 of
00:05:24.360 the
00:05:24.690 oven

00:05:24.720 they've
00:05:25.380 been
00:05:25.620 in
00:05:25.770 there
00:05:25.950 around
00:05:26.100 30
00:05:26.640 minutes

00:05:26.940 and
00:05:27.390 I
00:05:27.750 flip
00:05:28.110 them
00:05:28.230 over
00:05:28.380 halfway
00:05:28.980 through

00:05:29.190 just
00:05:29.730 so
00:05:29.910 that
00:05:30.120 they
00:05:30.270 Brown
00:05:30.630 evenly
00:05:30.890 you'll

00:05:31.890 see
00:05:32.040 that
00:05:32.160 they
00:05:32.310 brown
00:05:32.550 top
00:05:32.820 to
00:05:33.000 bottom
00:05:33.150 rather

00:05:33.660 than
00:05:33.840 around
00:05:34.020 the
00:05:34.170 edges
00:05:34.620 but
00:05:34.860 it's
00:05:35.010 all
00:05:35.220 crisp

00:05:35.640 because
00:05:36.210 of
00:05:36.330 the
00:05:36.480 gram
00:05:36.750 flour
00:05:36.990 inside
00:05:37.530 them
00:05:37.740 so

00:05:37.950 we'll
00:05:38.550 let
00:05:38.670 those
00:05:38.790 cool
00:05:39.060 for
00:05:39.270 a
00:05:39.300 little
00:05:39.540 bit

00:05:39.690 and
00:05:39.870 then
00:05:40.320 we're
00:05:40.440 going
00:05:40.560 to
00:05:40.590 make
00:05:40.800 our
00:05:41.070 tahini

00:05:42.000 maple
00:05:42.570 dressing
00:05:43.070 so
00:05:44.070 in
00:05:44.340 this
00:05:44.550 bowl
00:05:44.880 I've
00:05:45.330 got

00:05:45.750 a
00:05:45.780 really
00:05:46.020 simple
00:05:46.470 mixture
00:05:46.740 of
00:05:46.950 maple
00:05:47.310 syrup

00:05:47.340 and
00:05:47.940 he
00:05:48.660 knead
00:05:48.870 into
00:05:49.230 that
00:05:49.770 we're
00:05:50.070 going
00:05:50.220 to

00:05:50.310 add
00:05:50.490 the
00:05:51.210 juice
00:05:51.480 of
00:05:51.660 half
00:05:51.720 a
00:05:52.200 lemon
00:05:52.350 and

00:05:53.630 depending
00:05:54.630 on
00:05:54.720 the
00:05:54.870 size
00:05:55.140 or
00:05:55.740 the
00:05:56.250 juiciness

00:05:56.640 of
00:05:56.910 your
00:05:57.090 lemons
00:05:57.450 you
00:05:57.750 can
00:05:57.900 add
00:05:58.020 a
00:05:58.050 little
00:05:58.320 bit

00:05:58.440 more
00:05:58.560 a
00:05:58.800 little
00:05:59.190 bit
00:05:59.250 less
00:06:00.290 dressings
00:06:01.290 or

00:06:01.470 sauces
00:06:01.920 are
00:06:02.160 so
00:06:02.370 much
00:06:02.610 to
00:06:02.640 your
00:06:03.060 own
00:06:03.270 taste
00:06:03.720 so

00:06:04.050 trust
00:06:04.530 your
00:06:04.620 instinct
00:06:05.310 if
00:06:05.460 you
00:06:05.820 like
00:06:06.030 the
00:06:06.180 way

00:06:06.300 it
00:06:06.330 tastes
00:06:06.930 and
00:06:07.080 the
00:06:07.350 texture
00:06:08.130 then
00:06:08.370 go
00:06:08.520 with

00:06:08.700 that
00:06:08.930 so
00:06:09.930 stir
00:06:10.380 the
00:06:10.620 lemon
00:06:10.920 juice
00:06:11.160 in
00:06:11.370 just

00:06:11.970 until
00:06:12.450 it's
00:06:12.900 combined
00:06:13.560 and
00:06:14.180 then
00:06:15.180 we
00:06:15.420 have

00:06:15.720 about
00:06:16.650 a
00:06:16.830 tablespoon
00:06:17.640 of
00:06:17.940 garlic
00:06:18.480 oil
00:06:19.290 and

00:06:20.210 again
00:06:21.210 that
00:06:21.390 adds
00:06:21.570 a
00:06:21.840 really
00:06:22.200 nice
00:06:22.880 it's

00:06:23.880 intense
00:06:24.420 garlic
00:06:25.080 but
00:06:25.680 it
00:06:25.950 doesn't
00:06:26.340 burn
00:06:26.580 you

00:06:26.880 like
00:06:27.060 raw
00:06:27.360 garlic
00:06:27.570 would
00:06:27.990 so
00:06:28.230 it's
00:06:28.380 a
00:06:28.530 good

00:06:28.710 combination
00:06:29.010 to
00:06:29.430 have
00:06:29.610 and
00:06:31.160 just
00:06:32.160 stir
00:06:32.550 that

00:06:32.790 through
00:06:32.850 until
00:06:34.010 it's
