00:00:21.990 I
00:00:22.230 once
00:00:22.500 saw
00:00:22.619 a
00:00:22.650 woman
00:00:22.920 wearing
00:00:23.070 a

00:00:23.220 dress
00:00:23.369 made
00:00:23.640 out

00:00:24.180 although
00:00:24.630 I
00:00:24.660 do

00:00:24.779 have
00:00:24.930 to
00:00:25.050 admit
00:00:25.260 she
00:00:25.500 did
00:00:25.650 look
00:00:25.800 delicious
00:00:26.279 but

00:00:26.490 anyway
00:00:26.939 there's
00:00:27.119 nothing
00:00:27.240 gratuitous
00:00:27.840 about

00:00:28.140 its
00:00:28.289 addition
00:00:28.710 here
00:00:28.980 as
00:00:29.130 it's
00:00:29.580 going
00:00:29.670 to

00:00:29.730 provide
00:00:30.000 some
00:00:30.240 much-needed
00:00:30.449 fat
00:00:30.990 and
00:00:31.260 of

00:00:31.349 course
00:00:31.560 flavor
00:00:31.800 but
00:00:32.250 anyway
00:00:32.430 let's
00:00:32.640 get
00:00:32.759 this

00:00:32.880 started
00:00:33.239 by
00:00:33.329 cooking
00:00:33.570 some
00:00:33.840 of
00:00:33.930 the

00:00:33.989 aforementioned
00:00:34.320 bacon
00:00:34.920 in
00:00:35.100 some
00:00:35.700 butter

00:00:36.300 oh
00:00:36.329 yeah
00:00:36.840 that's
00:00:37.050 always
00:00:37.170 a
00:00:37.260 good
00:00:37.380 way
00:00:37.530 to

00:00:37.590 start
00:00:37.770 a
00:00:37.860 recipe
00:00:38.250 so
00:00:38.820 we'll
00:00:38.940 cook
00:00:39.090 some
00:00:39.270 sliced

00:00:39.510 up
00:00:39.660 bacon
00:00:40.020 and
00:00:40.230 a
00:00:40.290 little
00:00:40.320 bit
00:00:40.649 of
00:00:40.770 butter
00:00:40.920 and

00:00:41.160 a
00:00:41.610 skillet
00:00:41.879 set
00:00:42.120 over
00:00:42.360 medium
00:00:42.690 heat
00:00:42.870 and
00:00:43.110 we

00:00:43.649 want
00:00:43.829 to
00:00:43.920 cook
00:00:44.040 this
00:00:44.160 almost
00:00:44.670 but
00:00:44.910 not
00:00:45.030 quite

00:00:45.090 crisp
00:00:45.660 which
00:00:46.320 is
00:00:46.440 of
00:00:46.530 course
00:00:46.680 going
00:00:46.890 to
00:00:46.950 take

00:00:47.100 five
00:00:47.280 or
00:00:47.430 ten
00:00:47.550 minutes
00:00:47.850 so
00:00:48.390 keep
00:00:48.600 an
00:00:48.690 eye
00:00:48.780 in
00:00:48.899 it

00:00:49.020 but
00:00:49.500 while
00:00:49.680 that's
00:00:49.800 working
00:00:50.070 we
00:00:50.399 can
00:00:50.520 go
00:00:50.640 ahead

00:00:50.820 and
00:00:50.969 get
00:00:51.059 our
00:00:51.180 vegetables
00:00:51.629 together
00:00:51.899 so
00:00:52.530 in
00:00:52.649 a

00:00:52.680 bowl
00:00:52.860 I
00:00:52.890 have
00:00:53.100 a
00:00:53.129 beautiful
00:00:53.760 array
00:00:53.969 vegetables

00:00:54.559 featuring
00:00:55.559 onions
00:00:55.920 carrots
00:00:56.460 and
00:00:56.550 celery

00:00:56.640 we're
00:00:57.420 also
00:00:57.510 going
00:00:57.660 to
00:00:57.750 do
00:00:57.840 some
00:00:58.020 mushrooms

00:00:58.410 and
00:00:58.710 some
00:00:58.800 pepper
00:00:59.640 I
00:01:00.030 have
00:01:00.390 two
00:01:00.510 kinds
00:01:00.809 I'm

00:01:00.899 gonna
00:01:01.020 use
00:01:01.109 some
00:01:01.230 red
00:01:01.440 and
00:01:01.680 a
00:01:02.129 green
00:01:02.160 poblano

00:01:02.730 and
00:01:03.030 I
00:01:03.239 think
00:01:03.449 we'll
00:01:03.539 also
00:01:03.690 throw
00:01:03.780 in
00:01:04.080 a
00:01:04.140 few

00:01:04.290 cloves
00:01:04.530 of
00:01:04.650 garlic
00:01:04.979 that
00:01:05.339 should
00:01:05.460 be
00:01:05.549 goodness

00:01:05.880 and
00:01:06.119 what
00:01:06.390 we'll
00:01:06.510 do
00:01:06.600 is
00:01:06.720 we'll
00:01:06.810 cook
00:01:07.020 these

00:01:07.140 vegetables
00:01:07.229 in
00:01:07.830 that
00:01:08.130 bacon
00:01:08.520 butter
00:01:08.700 mixture

00:01:09.090 but
00:01:09.689 not
00:01:09.810 like
00:01:09.990 this
00:01:10.229 what
00:01:10.560 we
00:01:10.650 want
00:01:10.860 to
00:01:10.950 do

00:01:11.040 first
00:01:11.250 is
00:01:11.490 grind
00:01:11.820 these
00:01:11.970 in
00:01:12.119 the
00:01:12.210 food

00:01:12.390 processor
00:01:12.960 fairly
00:01:13.560 small
00:01:13.830 all
00:01:14.280 right
00:01:14.310 we

00:01:14.460 don't
00:01:14.580 want
00:01:14.700 a
00:01:14.729 super
00:01:15.030 wet
00:01:15.210 puree
00:01:15.600 but
00:01:16.049 we
00:01:16.170 do

00:01:16.259 want
00:01:16.380 to
00:01:16.409 pulse
00:01:16.590 on
00:01:16.799 and
00:01:16.950 off
00:01:17.040 until
00:01:17.189 we
00:01:17.400 have

00:01:17.520 something
00:01:17.820 pretty
00:01:17.970 fine
00:01:18.270 and
00:01:18.720 by
00:01:18.810 the
00:01:18.900 way

00:01:18.990 anytime
00:01:19.229 you're
00:01:19.470 doing
00:01:19.560 something
00:01:19.830 like
00:01:19.920 this

00:01:20.070 make
00:01:20.310 sure
00:01:20.340 you
00:01:20.580 stop
00:01:20.790 a
00:01:20.820 couple
00:01:21.180 times
00:01:21.420 and

00:01:21.780 take
00:01:22.170 a
00:01:22.200 spatula
00:01:22.439 and
00:01:22.740 scrape
00:01:22.979 down
00:01:23.009 your

00:01:23.159 sides
00:01:23.520 so
00:01:24.090 everything
00:01:24.450 ends
00:01:24.600 up
00:01:24.720 about
00:01:24.869 the

00:01:25.110 same
00:01:25.259 size
00:01:25.470 so
00:01:26.130 we
00:01:26.220 keep
00:01:26.369 blitzing
00:01:26.729 on
00:01:26.850 and
00:01:27.030 off

00:01:27.119 until
00:01:27.600 we
00:01:27.869 end
00:01:28.020 up
00:01:28.170 with
00:01:28.320 something
00:01:28.680 that

00:01:28.829 looks
00:01:29.009 like
00:01:29.189 this
00:01:29.430 so
00:01:30.180 like
00:01:30.270 I
00:01:30.360 said
00:01:30.479 we're

00:01:30.630 going
00:01:30.720 to
00:01:30.810 grind
00:01:30.930 it
00:01:31.110 pretty
00:01:31.290 small
00:01:31.409 but
00:01:31.770 we

00:01:31.890 don't
00:01:32.070 want
00:01:32.189 a
00:01:32.220 big
00:01:32.340 soupy
00:01:32.670 mess
00:01:32.790 here
00:01:33.030 so
00:01:33.600 go

00:01:33.780 to
00:01:33.930 fine
00:01:34.140 make
00:01:34.500 it
00:01:34.619 look
00:01:34.740 like
00:01:34.860 this
00:01:35.100 and
00:01:35.340 by

00:01:35.909 now
00:01:36.060 hopefully
00:01:36.299 that
00:01:36.600 bacon
00:01:37.079 that's
00:01:37.200 been

00:01:37.290 cooking
00:01:37.560 in
00:01:37.770 the
00:01:37.860 butter
00:01:38.040 on
00:01:38.220 medium
00:01:38.369 is
00:01:38.820 ready

00:01:39.329 so
00:01:40.170 at
00:01:40.229 this
00:01:40.320 point
00:01:40.500 we'll
00:01:40.680 go
00:01:40.770 ahead
00:01:40.829 and

00:01:41.009 transfer
00:01:41.189 the
00:01:41.400 vegetables
00:01:41.520 into
00:01:41.939 our
00:01:42.060 pan
00:01:42.420 and

00:01:42.689 we'll
00:01:43.560 cook
00:01:43.740 those
00:01:43.890 turn
00:01:44.159 occasionally
00:01:44.759 until

00:01:45.030 they
00:01:45.119 soften
00:01:45.390 and
00:01:45.720 sweeten
00:01:46.020 up
00:01:46.079 for
00:01:46.590 about

00:01:46.740 five
00:01:46.950 minutes
00:01:47.100 or
00:01:47.340 so

00:01:47.729 all
00:01:47.850 right
00:01:47.970 we're
00:01:48.060 not
00:01:48.149 trying
00:01:48.329 to
00:01:48.360 caramelize

00:01:48.810 them
00:01:48.899 or
00:01:49.049 brown
00:01:49.259 them
00:01:49.409 but
00:01:49.590 we
00:01:49.680 do
00:01:49.770 want
00:01:49.920 to

00:01:49.979 take
00:01:50.159 the
00:01:50.280 riot
00:01:50.490 off
00:01:50.850 and
00:01:51.149 while
00:01:51.750 that's

00:01:51.869 happening
00:01:52.079 I
00:01:52.500 am
00:01:52.530 going
00:01:52.829 to
00:01:52.890 add
00:01:52.950 a
00:01:52.979 small

00:01:53.159 pinch
00:01:53.850 of
00:01:53.970 dried
00:01:54.299 rosemary
00:01:54.329 I
00:01:55.049 generally

00:01:55.770 don't
00:01:55.890 like
00:01:55.979 a
00:01:56.070 really
00:01:56.369 OB
00:01:56.729 meatloaf
00:01:57.090 but
00:01:57.600 we

00:01:57.719 will
00:01:57.869 stir
00:01:58.049 in
00:01:58.170 a
00:01:58.229 little
00:01:58.469 bit
00:01:58.560 of
00:01:58.590 dried

00:01:58.829 rosemary
00:01:58.860 because
00:01:59.369 that's
00:01:59.579 going
00:01:59.670 to
00:01:59.729 work

00:01:59.880 really
00:02:00.119 well
00:02:00.270 with
00:02:00.570 the
00:02:00.630 bacon
00:02:01.020 in
00:02:01.110 the

00:02:01.200 Buffalo
00:02:01.530 and
00:02:01.770 then
00:02:02.280 like
00:02:02.460 I
00:02:02.549 said
00:02:02.610 we'll
00:02:02.909 cook

00:02:03.030 that
00:02:03.180 for
00:02:03.299 about
00:02:03.360 five
00:02:03.659 minutes
00:02:03.899 until
00:02:04.560 it

00:02:04.829 softens
00:02:04.979 up
00:02:05.340 and
00:02:05.610 kind
00:02:06.329 of
00:02:06.420 looks
00:02:06.630 like
00:02:06.689 this

00:02:07.020 and
00:02:07.350 it's
00:02:07.920 hard
00:02:07.950 to
00:02:08.099 tell
00:02:08.280 by
00:02:08.399 looks
00:02:08.670 but
00:02:09.390 if

00:02:09.450 you
00:02:09.539 were
00:02:09.660 to
00:02:09.780 taste
00:02:09.989 a
00:02:10.140 little
00:02:10.379 bit
00:02:10.470 of
00:02:10.590 this

00:02:10.679 it
00:02:10.890 would
00:02:10.979 not
00:02:11.160 taste
00:02:11.430 raw
00:02:11.700 so
00:02:12.300 that's
00:02:12.450 looking

00:02:12.750 good
00:02:12.900 at
00:02:13.200 that

00:02:13.710 we
00:02:13.830 will
00:02:13.980 turn
00:02:14.130 off
00:02:14.310 the
00:02:14.460 heat
00:02:14.670 and
00:02:14.970 move
00:02:15.480 on
00:02:15.630 to

00:02:15.780 the
00:02:15.870 breadcrumb
00:02:16.260 stage
00:02:16.530 swimmable
00:02:17.460 I
00:02:17.610 have
00:02:17.820 a

00:02:17.850 couple
00:02:18.120 cups
00:02:18.420 of
00:02:18.600 fresh
00:02:18.960 breadcrumbs
00:02:19.800 those

00:02:20.550 are
00:02:20.700 not
00:02:20.850 dry
00:02:21.150 that's
00:02:21.660 just
00:02:21.810 the
00:02:21.900 inside
00:02:22.200 of
00:02:22.410 a

00:02:22.500 day-old
00:02:22.770 loaf
00:02:23.190 of
00:02:23.400 Italian
00:02:23.520 or
00:02:23.970 French
00:02:24.000 bread

00:02:24.450 and
00:02:24.780 of
00:02:25.320 course
00:02:25.500 you
00:02:25.590 can
00:02:25.680 do
00:02:25.770 that
00:02:25.920 in
00:02:25.980 your

00:02:26.010 food
00:02:26.220 processor
00:02:26.250 also
00:02:27.030 I
00:02:27.060 just
00:02:27.240 broke
00:02:27.540 them
00:02:27.690 up

00:02:27.780 with
00:02:27.960 my
00:02:27.990 hands
00:02:28.260 and
00:02:28.530 what
00:02:28.890 we'll
00:02:29.010 do
00:02:29.100 is
00:02:29.220 we'll

00:02:29.310 add
00:02:29.460 our
00:02:29.490 cooked
00:02:29.850 vegetable
00:02:30.420 mixture
00:02:30.690 to

00:02:30.930 these
00:02:31.080 crumbs
00:02:31.410 along
00:02:32.310 with
00:02:32.460 a
00:02:32.490 splash
00:02:32.790 of

00:02:33.000 whole
00:02:33.150 milk
00:02:33.180 and
00:02:33.630 we'll
00:02:34.080 give
00:02:34.200 that
00:02:34.230 a
00:02:34.410 very

00:02:34.680 thorough
00:02:34.890 mixing
00:02:35.340 before
00:02:35.880 we
00:02:35.970 have
00:02:36.120 the
00:02:36.240 rest

00:02:36.420 of
00:02:36.480 the
00:02:36.570 ingredients

00:02:37.290 speaking
00:02:37.920 of
00:02:38.010 which
00:02:38.100 we
00:02:38.220 don't
00:02:38.280 want
00:02:38.460 to
00:02:38.520 add

00:02:38.580 those
00:02:38.760 if
00:02:38.970 this
00:02:39.120 mixture
00:02:39.390 is
00:02:39.480 really
00:02:39.630 hot
00:02:39.960 so

00:02:40.290 once
00:02:40.890 we
00:02:41.010 mix
00:02:41.160 this
00:02:41.310 up
00:02:41.460 we
00:02:41.610 should
00:02:41.760 probably

00:02:41.880 let
00:02:42.120 it
00:02:42.270 cool
00:02:42.390 to
00:02:42.450 room
00:02:42.570 temp
00:02:42.990 before
00:02:43.590 adding

00:02:43.860 the
00:02:43.950 rest
00:02:44.070 of
00:02:44.190 the
00:02:44.280 ingredients

00:02:44.940 now
00:02:45.240 did
00:02:45.420 I
00:02:45.540 not
00:02:45.930 really
00:02:46.200 I
00:02:46.350 lit
00:02:46.740 a
00:02:46.770 cool
00:02:46.980 little

00:02:47.190 but
00:02:47.340 it
00:02:47.400 was
00:02:47.490 still
00:02:47.610 kind
00:02:47.820 of
00:02:47.850 warm
00:02:48.000 but

00:02:48.690 officially
00:02:49.200 let
00:02:49.710 it
00:02:49.830 cool
00:02:49.950 to
00:02:50.070 room
00:02:50.250 temp
00:02:50.490 and

00:02:50.730 then
00:02:51.150 once
00:02:51.300 that
00:02:51.420 does
00:02:51.630 cool
00:02:51.870 down
00:02:52.050 we
00:02:52.470 will

00:02:52.620 proceed
00:02:52.800 with
00:02:53.100 the
00:02:53.190 rest
00:02:53.310 of
00:02:53.430 the
00:02:53.520 ingredients

00:02:53.610 which
00:02:54.330 include
00:02:54.480 some
00:02:55.440 freshly
00:02:55.680 ground
00:02:56.070 black

00:02:56.310 pepper
00:02:56.430 and
00:02:56.940 some
00:02:57.450 salt
00:02:57.510 of
00:02:57.810 course
00:02:58.020 we
00:02:58.710 also

00:02:58.860 want
00:02:59.070 to
00:02:59.130 give
00:02:59.250 it
00:02:59.310 a
00:02:59.370 few
00:02:59.520 dashes
00:02:59.760 of

00:03:00.000 Worcestershire
00:03:00.510 sauce
00:03:00.840 as
00:03:01.560 well
00:03:01.800 as
00:03:01.920 one

00:03:02.100 large
00:03:02.340 egg
00:03:02.640 and
00:03:02.940 then
00:03:03.570 let's
00:03:03.750 do
00:03:03.870 just
00:03:03.990 a

00:03:04.140 little

00:03:08.010 your

00:03:08.160 meatloaf
00:03:08.340 and
00:03:08.790 then
00:03:09.720 what
00:03:09.870 we'll
00:03:09.990 do
00:03:10.110 is
00:03:10.200 we'll

00:03:10.320 give
00:03:10.470 this
00:03:10.650 a
00:03:10.710 mix
00:03:10.980 before
00:03:11.610 adding
00:03:12.120 the
00:03:12.240 star

00:03:12.510 of

00:03:15.090 the
00:03:15.150 way

00:03:15.300 while
00:03:15.480 it
00:03:15.600 is
00:03:15.720 nutritious
00:03:16.020 and
00:03:16.350 delicious

00:03:16.410 ground
00:03:17.250 Buffalo
00:03:17.430 does
00:03:17.790 provide
00:03:18.120 a
00:03:18.150 couple

00:03:18.360 challenges
00:03:18.710 it's
00:03:19.710 generally
00:03:20.190 very
00:03:20.460 very
00:03:20.730 lean

00:03:20.970 and
00:03:21.240 for
00:03:21.900 whatever
00:03:22.020 reason
00:03:22.470 it's
00:03:22.650 sold
00:03:22.860 ground

00:03:23.220 very

00:03:23.970 are
00:03:24.600 two
00:03:24.750 things
00:03:24.930 that
00:03:24.960 aren't

00:03:25.140 necessarily
00:03:25.470 great
00:03:25.830 if
00:03:26.100 you're
00:03:26.370 making

00:03:26.490 meatloaf
00:03:26.910 so
00:03:27.600 to
00:03:27.660 counter
00:03:28.050 that
00:03:28.170 that's
00:03:28.440 why

00:03:28.560 we're
00:03:28.710 doing
00:03:28.770 the
00:03:28.950 recipe

00:04:57.330 pull
00:04:57.540 it
00:04:57.630 out
00:04:57.720 and
00:04:58.080 you

00:04:58.470 should
00:04:58.680 be
00:04:58.800 looking

00:05:00.540 you've
00:05:00.810 ever
00:05:00.960 seen

00:05:01.290 and
00:05:01.740 then
00:05:02.400 I
00:05:02.490 know
00:05:02.550 it's
00:05:02.790 not
00:05:02.880 going
00:05:03.030 to
00:05:03.120 be

00:05:03.180 easy
00:05:03.330 but
00:05:03.960 you
00:05:04.020 really
00:05:04.290 do
00:05:04.380 want
00:05:04.560 to
00:05:04.590 let
00:05:04.740 this

00:05:04.860 sit
00:05:05.070 for
00:05:05.100 at
00:05:05.310 least
00:05:05.400 ten
00:05:05.670 minutes
00:05:05.790 before
00:05:06.060 you

00:05:06.270 cut
00:05:06.480 into
00:05:06.630 it
00:05:06.810 but
00:05:07.380 I
00:05:07.440 was
00:05:07.710 starving
00:05:07.920 I
00:05:08.190 wanted

00:05:08.460 to
00:05:08.520 finish
00:05:08.610 the

00:05:09.690 sliced
00:05:10.050 right
00:05:10.290 in

00:05:10.770 as
00:05:11.400 you
00:05:11.550 can
00:05:11.790 hopefully
00:05:12.030 see
00:05:12.420 from
00:05:12.660 this

00:05:12.810 shot
00:05:13.050 we

00:05:14.010 meatloaf
00:05:14.310 that's

00:05:14.790 beautiful
00:05:15.270 on
00:05:15.330 the
00:05:15.450 outside
00:05:15.480 but
00:05:16.080 incredibly

00:05:17.040 tender
00:05:17.370 and
00:05:17.610 moist
00:05:17.700 on
00:05:17.910 the
00:05:18.000 inside
00:05:18.090 I
00:05:18.750 mean

00:05:19.620 juicy
00:05:19.890 that
00:05:20.070 is
00:05:20.220 so
00:05:21.180 let
00:05:21.300 me
00:05:21.360 go

00:05:21.450 ahead
00:05:21.540 and
00:05:21.630 cut
00:05:21.750 off
00:05:21.900 one
00:05:22.050 nice
00:05:22.230 big

00:05:24.690 veggies
00:05:25.020 and
00:05:25.140 mashed
00:05:25.320 potatoes

00:05:25.820 along
00:05:26.820 with
00:05:26.940 some

00:05:27.570 mushroom
00:05:27.900 gravy

00:05:28.290 by

00:05:29.160 mushroom
00:05:29.460 gravy
00:05:29.580 sold

00:05:29.910 separately
00:05:30.330 I
00:05:30.510 know
00:05:31.230 we
00:05:31.410 have
00:05:31.530 a
00:05:31.560 video
00:05:31.860 for

00:05:32.100 that
00:05:32.130 or
00:05:32.580 you
00:05:32.640 could
00:05:32.940 just
00:05:33.090 make
00:05:33.210 a
00:05:33.240 gravy

00:05:33.840 drippings
00:05:34.260 and
00:05:34.380 I
00:05:35.040 hope
00:05:35.220 it's
00:05:35.430 pretty

00:05:35.640 obvious
00:05:35.970 to

00:05:37.920 tender
00:05:38.100 this
00:05:38.400 meatloaf
00:05:38.610 really
00:05:39.090 is
00:05:39.270 it
00:05:40.020 really

00:05:40.050 does
00:05:40.380 melt
00:05:40.620 in
00:05:40.710 your
00:05:40.740 mouth
00:05:40.860 and
00:05:41.190 of
00:05:41.670 course

00:05:41.820 the
00:05:42.000 bacon
00:05:42.240 helped
00:05:42.540 and
00:05:43.260 what
00:05:43.380 is
00:05:43.470 Buffalo

00:05:43.710 taste
00:05:44.010 like
00:05:44.220 pretty
00:05:44.760 much
00:05:44.820 exactly
00:05:45.210 like

00:05:45.420 grass-fed
00:05:46.020 beef
00:05:46.260 and
00:05:46.830 what
00:05:46.950 does
00:05:47.040 grass-fed

00:05:47.370 beef
00:05:47.550 taste
00:05:47.820 like
00:05:48.030 pretty
00:05:48.570 much
00:05:48.600 like

00:05:48.750 corn-fed
00:05:49.260 beef
00:05:49.470 except
00:05:50.370 maybe
00:05:50.700 the
00:05:51.120 tiniest

00:05:51.720 tiniest
00:05:52.080 bit
00:05:52.530 more
00:05:52.710 gamey
00:05:52.980 and
00:05:53.280 I
00:05:53.610 mean
00:05:53.790 really

00:05:54.000 tiny
00:05:54.300 you
00:05:54.600 probably
00:05:54.870 won't
00:05:55.020 even
00:05:55.140 notice
00:05:55.350 it

00:05:55.680 okay
00:05:56.250 so
00:05:56.310 Buffalo
00:05:56.820 is
00:05:56.970 nothing
00:05:57.270 to
