00:01:21.600 oil
00:01:21.960 you

00:01:23.700 but
00:01:23.939 if
00:01:24.420 you

00:01:24.570 prefer
00:01:24.750 you

00:01:25.290 use
00:01:25.350 sesame
00:01:26.340 seed
00:01:26.700 oil
00:01:26.820 it

00:01:27.689 just
00:01:27.960 gives
00:01:28.110 a
00:01:28.259 very
00:01:28.740 good
00:01:28.979 flavor
00:01:29.189 but
00:01:29.939 we

00:01:30.060 just
00:01:30.210 use
00:01:30.329 canola
00:01:30.780 well
00:01:31.310 okay
00:01:32.310 this
00:01:32.520 is
00:01:32.640 ready

00:01:32.880 let's
00:01:33.240 go
00:01:33.360 ahead
00:01:33.420 and
00:01:33.570 put
00:01:33.659 in
00:01:33.780 our
00:01:33.930 ginger

00:01:52.930 but
00:01:53.930 it
00:01:54.050 does
00:01:54.229 give
00:01:54.410 a
00:01:54.440 little
00:01:54.619 flavor
00:01:54.770 but
00:01:55.220 if

00:01:55.340 you
00:01:55.520 are
00:01:55.820 averse
00:01:56.150 to
00:01:56.180 any
00:01:56.479 one
00:01:56.720 of
00:01:56.750 those
00:01:56.990 two

00:01:57.259 you
00:01:58.070 can
00:01:58.190 go
00:01:58.310 ahead
00:01:58.369 and
00:01:58.550 skip
00:01:58.790 it
00:02:00.250 and
00:02:01.250 just
00:02:01.310 I

00:02:01.850 mean
00:02:02.570 you
00:02:02.720 don't
00:02:02.869 want
00:02:02.990 it
00:02:03.080 to
00:02:03.170 burn
00:02:03.380 so
00:02:03.860 just

00:02:45.460 just
00:02:45.610 gonna

00:02:46.330 a
00:02:46.540 little
00:02:46.750 bit

00:02:46.990 so
00:02:47.410 then
00:02:47.620 it
00:02:47.770 gets
00:02:47.980 lit
00:02:48.220 off
00:02:48.370 they
00:02:48.640 look
00:02:48.850 but
00:02:49.030 it

00:02:49.510 will
00:02:49.780 pretty
00:02:50.140 much
00:02:50.230 get
00:02:50.560 cooked
00:02:50.920 in

00:04:03.020 a
00:04:03.170 little
00:04:03.410 bit

00:04:18.200 really
00:04:18.470 don't
00:04:18.650 need
00:04:18.769 to

00:04:18.860 be
00:04:18.980 cooked
00:04:19.220 and

00:04:28.100 I
00:04:30.040 feel
00:04:31.040 if

00:04:31.310 you
00:04:31.580 don't
00:04:31.850 eat
00:04:32.060 egg

00:04:41.780 a
00:04:41.930 boil
00:04:42.320 and
00:04:42.500 then
00:04:43.420 simmer
00:04:44.420 it
00:04:44.870 for
00:04:44.930 a

00:04:45.080 couple
00:04:45.380 of
00:04:45.470 minutes
00:04:46.130 and
00:04:46.850 then
00:04:47.170 take
00:04:48.170 it
00:04:48.290 from

00:04:50.900 10
00:04:51.200 as
00:04:51.470 we

00:04:51.620 make
00:04:51.770 sure
00:04:51.980 that
00:04:52.130 the
00:04:52.280 noodles
00:04:52.670 are
00:04:52.850 cooked

00:04:52.880 that's
00:04:53.330 what
00:04:53.570 you
00:04:54.170 really
00:04:54.530 want
00:04:54.770 to

00:04:55.820 very

00:04:56.150 well
00:04:56.530 the

00:04:58.040 are
00:04:58.220 so
00:04:58.940 fine
00:04:59.270 that

00:04:59.300 they
00:04:59.870 cook
00:05:00.050 really
00:05:00.080 fast

00:05:02.540 overcook
00:05:02.840 them

00:05:03.020 also
00:05:03.200 because
00:05:04.070 they
00:05:04.670 should
00:05:04.820 retain
00:05:05.060 their

00:05:05.300 shape
00:05:05.330 and
