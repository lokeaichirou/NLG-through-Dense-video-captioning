00:02:59.830 well
00:03:00.190 blended
00:03:00.720 now
00:03:01.720 when

00:03:02.080 get

00:03:02.170 that
00:03:02.350 roasted
00:03:02.620 garlic
00:03:02.800 out
00:03:03.130 it's
00:03:03.280 gonna
00:03:03.400 be

00:03:03.580 beautiful
00:03:03.970 it's

00:03:06.880 and
00:03:07.330 don't
00:03:07.690 be
00:03:07.870 worried

00:03:09.010 so
00:03:09.190 much
00:03:09.340 garlic

00:03:10.870 it
