00:00:00.000 I
00:00:00.120 feel
00:00:00.450 like
00:00:00.570 people
00:00:00.840 like
00:00:01.230 to
00:00:01.410 order
00:00:01.589 mussels

00:00:01.979 attic
00:00:02.159 restaurants
00:00:02.610 but
00:00:02.730 they
00:00:02.850 don't
00:00:03.149 usually

00:00:03.360 make
00:00:03.659 them
00:00:03.810 in
00:00:03.959 their
00:00:04.080 home
00:00:04.290 because
00:00:04.589 they're

00:00:04.740 scared
00:00:04.920 of
00:00:05.250 them
00:00:05.400 and
00:00:05.670 they
00:00:05.819 are
00:00:05.940 so
00:00:06.270 easy
00:00:06.299 it's

00:00:07.049 actually
00:00:07.620 think
00:00:08.130 of
00:00:08.250 them
00:00:08.370 like
00:00:08.550 shrimp
00:00:08.880 or

00:00:09.059 you
00:00:09.660 know
00:00:09.780 even
00:00:09.809 clams
00:00:10.469 they
00:00:11.070 are
00:00:11.250 so
00:00:11.690 simple

00:00:12.690 and
00:00:13.460 beautiful
00:00:14.460 so
00:00:14.639 I
00:00:14.670 came
00:00:14.969 up
00:00:15.059 with
00:00:15.120 this

00:00:15.299 recipe
00:00:15.509 because
00:00:15.870 I
00:00:16.170 just
00:00:16.379 love
00:00:17.060 garlic
00:00:18.060 and

00:00:18.240 white
00:00:18.539 wine
00:00:18.570 that
00:00:19.230 quintessential
00:00:20.010 French

00:00:20.430 flavoring
00:00:21.240 this
00:00:21.960 is
00:00:22.199 the
00:00:22.529 perfect
00:00:22.949 sauce
00:00:23.519 for

00:00:24.210 mussels
00:00:24.570 they
00:00:24.779 steam
00:00:25.260 and
00:00:25.619 absorb
00:00:26.010 all
00:00:26.279 those

00:00:26.580 flavors
00:00:27.090 and
00:00:27.359 dipping
00:00:28.199 the
00:00:28.320 bread
00:00:28.529 in
00:00:28.590 is
00:00:28.949 like

00:00:29.220 heaven
00:00:29.670 it
00:00:29.939 is
00:00:30.060 so
00:00:30.449 good
00:00:30.810 I
00:00:31.080 could
00:00:31.349 drink
00:00:31.980 this

00:00:32.219 stuff
00:00:32.460 like
00:00:32.700 soup
00:00:33.030 so
00:00:33.480 once
00:00:33.960 you
00:00:34.079 have
00:00:34.230 your

00:00:34.290 mussels
00:00:34.739 you
00:00:35.130 want
00:00:35.309 to
00:00:35.399 take
00:00:36.000 them
00:00:36.090 out
00:00:36.180 of
00:00:36.210 the

00:00:36.329 fridge
00:00:36.570 and
00:00:36.690 rinse
00:00:37.020 them
00:00:37.170 in
00:00:37.320 water
00:00:37.530 the
00:00:38.100 beard

00:00:38.340 of
00:00:38.460 a
00:00:38.579 mussel
00:00:38.969 is
00:00:39.180 sometimes
00:00:40.020 attached
00:00:40.379 and
00:00:40.680 it

00:00:40.829 basically
00:00:40.950 looks
00:00:41.520 like
00:00:41.640 this
00:00:41.790 scraggly
00:00:42.629 piece

00:00:43.050 of
00:00:43.200 lint
00:00:43.710 or
00:00:44.010 something
00:00:44.399 on
00:00:44.610 the
00:00:44.730 outer
00:00:44.879 shell

00:00:45.300 it's
00:00:45.840 pretty
00:00:46.200 easy
00:00:46.410 to
00:00:46.649 take
00:00:46.829 off
00:00:47.010 but
00:00:47.280 you

00:00:47.370 just
00:00:47.579 have
00:00:47.760 to
00:00:47.910 give
00:00:48.120 it
00:00:48.239 some
00:00:48.270 gusto
