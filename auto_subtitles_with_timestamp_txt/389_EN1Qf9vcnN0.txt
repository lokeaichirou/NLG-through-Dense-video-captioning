00:01:19.300 water
00:01:19.710 you

00:01:20.710 may
00:01:20.920 need
00:01:21.070 more
00:01:21.280 or
00:01:21.340 less
00:01:21.490 depending
00:01:22.300 on
00:01:22.420 the

00:01:22.540 kind
00:01:22.720 of
00:01:22.810 flour
00:01:22.990 that
00:01:23.229 you're
00:01:23.350 using
00:01:23.560 but
00:01:24.400 for

00:01:24.640 me
00:01:24.759 one
00:01:25.030 cup
00:01:25.330 was
00:01:25.690 exactly
00:01:26.380 the
00:01:26.560 right
00:01:26.680 amount

00:01:27.009 and
00:01:27.310 then
00:01:28.060 I'm
00:01:28.150 just
00:01:28.360 mixing
00:01:28.750 that
00:01:29.040 with
00:01:30.040 the

00:01:30.280 spoon
00:01:30.960 but
00:01:31.960 at
00:01:32.530 some
00:01:32.830 point
00:01:33.070 you'll
00:01:33.280 have
00:01:33.310 to

00:01:33.610 use
00:01:33.640 your
00:01:33.909 hands
00:01:34.300 and
00:01:34.530 knead
00:01:35.530 the
00:01:35.710 dough
00:01:35.740 for

00:01:35.920 about
00:01:36.310 three
00:01:36.670 to
00:01:36.700 five
00:01:37.060 minutes

00:01:45.460 the
00:01:46.000 consistency
00:01:46.570 of
00:01:46.720 the
00:01:46.930 dough
00:01:47.110 should
00:01:47.440 be

00:01:47.500 sticky
00:01:48.090 that
00:01:49.090 is
00:01:49.300 what
00:01:49.480 is
00:01:49.600 going
00:01:49.930 to
00:01:49.990 make

00:01:50.260 them
00:01:50.500 really
00:01:50.740 nice
00:01:51.040 and
00:01:51.070 airy
00:01:51.520 you
00:01:51.880 don't
00:01:52.120 want

00:01:52.270 your
00:01:52.390 dough
00:01:52.630 to
00:01:52.690 be
00:01:53.020 too
00:01:53.230 tough
00:01:53.470 so
00:01:54.430 if
00:01:54.640 the

00:01:54.790 dough
00:01:54.970 is
00:01:55.120 sticky
00:01:55.570 and
00:01:55.810 moist
00:01:56.380 and
00:01:56.950 that's
00:01:57.190 a

00:01:57.370 good
00:01:57.520 thing
00:01:57.730 if
00:01:58.240 it's
00:01:58.479 not
00:01:58.570 sticky
00:01:59.200 enough

00:01:59.229 then
00:01:59.650 you
00:01:59.740 should
00:01:59.920 add
00:02:00.100 a
00:02:00.130 little
00:02:00.400 bit
00:02:00.580 of

00:02:00.610 water
00:02:00.880 and
00:02:01.300 next
00:02:02.229 just
00:02:02.500 add
00:02:02.770 a
00:02:02.830 little
00:02:03.370 bit
00:02:03.580 of

00:02:03.610 oil
00:02:03.850 on
00:02:04.120 top
00:02:04.540 and
00:02:05.310 just
00:02:06.310 spread
00:02:06.640 that
00:02:06.670 all
00:02:07.000 over

00:02:09.869 you're
00:02:10.869 gonna
00:02:10.929 have
00:02:11.200 to
00:02:11.350 let
00:02:11.530 this
00:02:11.709 rise
00:02:12.070 for
00:02:12.610 a

00:02:12.640 few
00:02:12.880 hours
00:02:12.910 and
00:02:13.720 the
00:02:14.020 oil
00:02:14.230 is
00:02:14.470 going
00:02:14.650 to

00:02:14.800 prevent
00:02:15.040 it
00:02:15.250 from
00:02:15.280 forming
00:02:15.670 a
00:02:15.910 crust
00:02:17.459 and
00:02:18.459 as

00:02:18.580 you
00:02:18.730 can
00:02:18.850 see
00:02:18.910 the
00:02:19.239 dough
00:02:19.360 is
00:02:19.390 really
00:02:19.720 nice
00:02:20.080 and

00:02:20.350 soft
00:02:21.180 so
00:02:22.180 then
00:02:22.330 just
00:02:22.450 cover
00:02:22.690 that
00:02:22.780 with

00:02:23.080 anything

00:02:25.360 some

00:02:25.540 foil
00:02:25.840 and
00:02:26.170 then

00:02:26.890 rise
00:02:27.070 for
00:02:27.100 about
00:02:27.670 two
00:02:28.000 to

00:02:28.180 four
00:02:28.390 hours
00:02:28.780 the
00:02:29.380 longer

00:02:30.010 it
00:02:30.070 rise

00:02:30.340 the
00:02:30.700 better
00:02:30.880 the
00:02:31.120 dough
00:02:31.270 will
00:02:31.570 be
00:02:31.720 next

00:02:32.020 preheat
00:02:32.650 a

00:03:11.140 out
00:03:11.380 the
00:03:11.830 dough
00:03:12.040 the
00:03:12.670 flatbread
00:03:13.360 form
00:03:13.750 make

00:03:14.530 sure
00:03:14.709 that
00:03:14.860 you
00:03:14.950 do
00:03:15.100 not
00:03:15.220 make
00:03:15.430 it
00:03:15.549 too
00:03:15.700 thin

00:03:15.940 otherwise
00:03:16.209 you'll
00:03:17.049 have
00:03:17.320 a
00:03:17.650 crunchy

00:03:18.580 flatbread
00:03:19.180 and
00:03:19.360 then
00:03:19.720 just
00:03:19.930 really
00:03:20.080 quickly

00:03:20.470 throw
00:03:21.040 it
00:03:21.190 on
00:03:21.340 the
00:03:21.549 pan
00:03:21.820 and
00:03:22.239 if
00:03:22.959 it
00:03:23.110 stretches

00:03:23.470 out
00:03:23.620 too
00:03:23.860 much
00:03:24.040 you
00:03:24.310 can
00:03:24.489 gather
00:03:24.670 it
00:03:24.910 together

00:03:25.090 and
00:03:25.950 let
00:03:26.950 that
00:03:27.220 cook
00:03:27.730 for
00:03:28.450 about
00:03:28.660 two
00:03:29.410 minutes

00:03:29.590 on
00:03:29.890 the
00:03:29.920 first
00:03:30.250 side
00:03:30.570 until
00:03:31.570 you
00:03:31.690 start
00:03:32.019 seeing

00:03:32.320 the
00:03:32.500 top
00:03:32.880 cooking
00:03:33.880 from
00:03:34.090 within
00:03:34.329 and
00:03:35.730 when
00:03:36.730 the

00:03:36.850 bottom
00:03:37.180 also
00:03:37.570 gets
00:03:37.870 nice
00:03:38.590 dark
00:03:38.950 brown
00:03:39.100 spots

00:03:41.060 and
00:03:41.260 then
00:03:42.260 on
00:03:42.470 the
00:03:42.650 second
00:03:43.040 side
00:03:43.250 cook
00:03:43.610 it
00:03:43.760 for

00:03:43.970 about
00:03:44.180 one
00:03:44.510 more
00:03:44.810 minutes

00:03:45.410 and
00:03:46.400 I
00:03:46.489 know
00:03:46.550 this
00:03:46.790 is
00:03:46.940 not
00:03:47.090 the
00:03:47.180 most

00:03:47.330 perfectly
00:03:47.840 shaped
00:03:48.160 flatbread
00:03:49.160 but
00:03:49.489 it's

00:03:49.760 homemade
00:03:50.209 so
00:03:50.540 it's
00:03:50.660 okay
00:03:51.970 and
00:03:52.970 this
00:03:53.180 is
00:03:53.360 what

00:03:53.569 it
00:03:53.690 should
00:03:53.720 look
00:03:54.080 like
00:03:56.860 and
00:03:58.269 then
00:03:59.269 just
00:03:59.480 repeat

00:03:59.630 the
00:03:59.959 same
00:04:00.230 process
00:04:00.530 just
00:04:01.340 put
00:04:01.519 some
00:04:01.760 oil
00:04:02.000 on

00:04:02.300 the
00:04:02.420 surface
00:04:02.750 you're
00:04:02.870 working
00:04:02.930 on
00:04:03.519 put
00:04:04.519 the

00:04:04.670 dough
00:04:04.819 on
00:04:04.849 top
00:04:06.099 you
00:04:07.099 can
00:04:07.310 put
00:04:07.489 a
00:04:07.519 little
00:04:07.730 bit

00:04:07.880 more
00:04:07.940 oil
00:04:08.209 if
00:04:08.420 you
00:04:08.450 want
00:04:08.780 to
00:04:09.110 and
00:04:10.060 then
00:04:11.060 just

00:04:11.090 flatten
00:04:11.660 it
00:04:11.780 out
00:04:12.400 into
00:04:13.400 a
00:04:13.730 circle
00:04:15.040 again

00:04:16.040 making
00:04:16.669 sure
00:04:16.850 it's
00:04:17.000 not
00:04:17.180 too
00:04:17.479 thin
00:04:18.250 because
00:04:19.250 if

00:04:19.400 it's
00:04:19.519 thicker
00:04:19.760 it'll
00:04:20.299 be
00:04:20.389 nicer
00:04:20.810 and
00:04:20.840 softer

00:04:21.139 and
00:04:21.829 then
00:04:22.669 again
00:04:22.910 really
00:04:23.120 quickly
00:04:23.419 just
00:04:23.570 throw

00:04:23.960 it
00:04:24.080 on
00:04:24.200 the
00:04:24.350 pan
00:04:26.620 gather
00:04:27.620 it
00:04:27.860 back
00:04:28.100 together
00:04:28.310 if

00:04:28.639 it
00:04:28.790 stretches
00:04:29.210 out
00:04:29.330 too
00:04:29.540 much
00:04:29.919 and
00:04:30.919 as
00:04:31.040 you
00:04:31.190 can

00:04:31.310 see
00:04:31.370 over
00:04:31.729 here
00:04:32.440 there's
00:04:33.440 the
00:04:33.710 dough
00:04:33.919 and

00:04:34.280 there's
00:04:34.460 where
00:04:34.760 it
00:04:34.790 has
00:04:35.090 dried
00:04:35.600 up
00:04:35.630 and
00:04:36.020 cooked

00:04:36.290 from
00:04:36.470 within
00:04:36.680 a
00:04:36.889 little
00:04:37.100 bit
00:04:37.250 so
00:04:37.990 while
00:04:38.990 the

00:04:39.200 bottom
00:04:39.500 is
00:04:39.650 cooking
00:04:40.160 the
00:04:40.370 top
00:04:40.639 will
00:04:40.880 start

00:04:40.910 drying
00:04:41.330 up
00:04:41.540 and
00:04:41.660 that's
00:04:41.870 when
00:04:42.110 you
00:04:42.200 can
00:04:42.440 tell

00:04:42.740 that
00:04:42.889 you're
00:04:43.040 ready
00:04:43.220 to
00:04:43.400 flip
00:04:43.639 it
00:04:43.820 as
00:04:44.690 well
00:04:45.080 as

00:04:45.320 when
00:04:45.620 the
00:04:45.710 bottom
00:04:46.010 is
00:04:46.220 getting
00:04:46.700 nice
00:04:47.090 dark

00:04:47.419 brown
00:04:47.630 spots
00:04:47.890 so
00:04:48.890 it
00:04:48.979 took
00:04:49.130 about
00:04:49.220 two
00:04:49.580 minutes

00:04:49.610 for
00:04:50.030 the
00:04:50.060 first
00:04:50.360 side
00:04:50.690 and
00:04:50.720 one
00:04:51.229 minute
00:04:51.440 for

00:04:51.740 the
00:04:51.830 second
00:04:52.250 side

00:04:59.610 and
00:05:00.150 that
00:05:00.599 one
00:05:00.840 is
00:05:00.960 ready
00:05:01.199 as
00:05:01.379 well
00:05:04.430 so

00:05:05.610 are
00:05:05.789 the
