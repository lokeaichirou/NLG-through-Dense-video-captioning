00:00:12.240 little
00:00:12.480 bit
00:00:12.599 healthier

00:00:18.180 much
00:00:18.330 easier
00:00:18.720 you

00:00:18.779 don't
00:00:19.080 have
00:00:19.230 all
00:00:19.350 that
00:00:19.529 grease
00:00:19.920 splatter

00:00:22.320 worry
00:00:22.439 about
00:00:22.529 getting
00:00:22.710 rid
00:00:22.980 of

00:00:23.279 that

00:00:23.310 extra
00:00:23.699 oil
00:00:23.970 that
00:00:24.539 you've
00:00:24.720 used
00:00:25.019 to

00:00:25.619 the

00:00:25.740 chicken
