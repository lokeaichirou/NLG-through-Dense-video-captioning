00:02:11.459 mean
00:02:11.760 a
00:02:11.790 couple

00:02:11.970 might
00:02:12.239 be
00:02:12.360 touching
00:02:12.660 the
00:02:12.750 bottom
00:02:13.050 but

00:02:13.410 using
00:02:13.650 this
00:02:13.770 method
00:02:13.980 they're
00:02:14.340 all

00:02:16.350 it
00:02:16.590 works
00:02:16.710 much

00:02:17.190 much
00:02:17.460 better

00:02:18.270 into
00:02:18.480 the

00:02:18.600 batter
