00:00:02.280 teach
00:00:02.460 you
00:00:02.639 guys

00:00:02.730 how
00:00:02.790 to
00:00:03.000 make
00:00:03.149 galbi
00:00:03.720 which
00:00:04.049 are
00:00:04.259 Korean
00:00:04.680 style

00:00:04.830 short
00:00:05.190 ribs
00:00:05.400 and
00:00:06.020 these
00:00:07.020 are
00:00:07.140 basically
00:00:07.290 just

00:00:07.560 beef
00:00:08.040 short
00:00:08.400 ribs
00:00:08.639 that
00:00:08.880 have
00:00:09.000 been
00:00:09.150 marinated

00:00:09.780 in
00:00:09.840 a
00:00:09.990 sort
00:00:10.530 of
00:00:10.590 sweet
00:00:10.800 soy
00:00:11.809 marinade
00:00:12.809 and
00:00:13.019 then

00:00:13.440 grilled
00:00:14.330 so
00:00:15.330 we're
00:00:15.450 gonna
00:00:15.540 start
00:00:15.750 with
00:00:15.870 some

00:00:16.020 green
00:00:16.199 onions
00:00:17.210 just
00:00:18.210 chopped
00:00:18.449 two
00:00:18.660 or
00:00:18.779 three

00:00:18.960 of
00:00:19.050 them
00:00:19.170 in
00:00:19.439 a
00:00:19.529 bowl
00:00:20.480 and
00:00:21.480 we're
00:00:21.660 just
00:00:21.810 making

00:00:22.050 our
00:00:22.109 marinade
00:00:22.529 here
00:00:23.210 so
00:00:24.210 an
00:00:24.539 important

00:00:25.019 component
00:00:25.170 here
00:00:25.529 is
00:00:25.680 actually
00:00:26.160 pair
00:00:26.580 so
00:00:27.420 I've

00:00:27.480 chalked
00:00:27.660 up
00:00:27.810 a
00:00:27.900 pair
00:00:28.140 here
00:00:28.439 could
00:00:29.039 put
00:00:29.189 in
00:00:29.279 a

00:00:29.369 few
00:00:29.490 cloves
00:00:29.760 of
00:00:29.910 garlic
00:00:30.269 I
00:00:30.570 think
00:00:31.230 we
00:00:31.289 take
00:00:31.410 my

00:00:31.529 immersion
00:00:31.710 blender
00:00:32.099 just
00:00:32.250 puree
00:00:32.790 it
00:00:32.940 all
00:00:33.200 now

00:00:34.200 what
00:00:34.440 the
00:00:34.559 pair
00:00:34.800 does
00:00:35.040 is
00:00:35.570 they
00:00:36.570 contribute

00:00:37.020 some
00:00:37.200 sugar
00:00:37.500 there's
00:00:38.280 a
00:00:38.340 lot
00:00:38.489 of
00:00:38.640 sugar
00:00:38.760 this

00:00:39.180 marinade
00:00:40.850 but
00:00:41.850 also
00:00:42.290 I've
00:00:43.290 heard
00:00:43.649 that
00:00:43.920 the

00:00:44.370 enzymes
00:00:44.789 in
00:00:44.940 the
00:00:45.030 pair
00:00:45.239 actually
00:00:45.600 I'll

00:00:45.660 tenderize
00:00:46.140 the
00:00:46.289 meat
00:00:47.780 so
00:00:48.780 we'll
00:00:48.930 add
00:00:49.020 a
00:00:49.050 few
00:00:49.170 a

00:00:49.739 few
00:00:50.010 tablespoons
00:00:50.640 here
00:00:51.210 of
00:00:51.390 brown
00:00:52.199 sugar

00:00:53.510 again
00:00:54.510 there's
00:00:55.199 a
00:00:55.289 lot
00:00:55.620 of
00:00:55.800 sugar
00:00:56.010 in
00:00:56.219 this

00:00:56.340 Meritage
00:00:56.730 and
00:00:56.910 the
00:00:56.969 reason
00:00:57.300 for
00:00:57.329 this
00:00:57.660 is
00:00:57.930 when

00:00:58.920 you
00:00:59.010 actually
00:00:59.160 cook
00:00:59.579 it
00:00:59.699 it
00:01:00.629 sort
00:01:00.750 of
00:01:00.840 acts

00:01:00.989 like
00:01:01.140 glaze
00:01:01.710 you
00:01:02.129 get
00:01:02.280 a
00:01:02.309 lot
00:01:02.489 of

00:01:02.609 carmelization
00:01:03.799 then
00:01:04.799 we're
00:01:04.949 gonna
00:01:05.040 put
00:01:05.280 in

00:01:05.430 about
00:01:06.860 about
00:01:07.860 a
00:01:07.890 hundred
00:01:08.280 milliliters
00:01:08.729 of
00:01:08.880 soy

00:01:09.659 sauce
00:01:09.799 I'm
00:01:10.799 here
00:01:10.979 I'm
00:01:11.070 using
00:01:11.159 tamari
00:01:11.610 which
00:01:11.729 is

00:01:12.659 Japanese
00:01:13.229 obviously
00:01:13.740 it
00:01:13.830 shouldn't
00:01:14.070 be
00:01:14.159 in
00:01:14.610 a

00:01:14.909 Korean
00:01:15.240 dish
00:01:15.450 but
00:01:15.869 I
00:01:16.590 really
00:01:17.280 love
00:01:17.430 the
00:01:17.520 flavor

00:01:17.759 of
00:01:17.850 tamari
00:01:18.240 and
00:01:19.049 I
00:01:19.229 very
00:01:19.759 video
00:01:20.759 but
00:01:22.040 you
00:01:23.040 don't

00:01:23.220 have
00:01:23.369 to
00:01:23.520 use
00:01:23.610 it
00:01:23.640 you
00:01:23.790 can
00:01:23.970 substitute
00:01:28.970 and

00:01:29.970 then
00:01:30.119 well
00:01:30.420 that's
00:01:30.570 a
00:01:30.689 mirror

00:01:34.530 gonna
00:01:34.650 add
00:01:35.210 about
00:01:36.210 40
00:01:36.810 or
00:01:36.900 50

00:01:37.020 milliliters
00:01:38.120 and
00:01:39.120 again
00:01:39.990 this
00:01:40.170 is
00:01:40.290 adding

00:01:40.590 more
00:01:41.000 sugar
00:01:44.090 and
00:01:45.090 I
00:01:45.780 like
00:01:46.080 to
00:01:46.170 add
00:01:46.260 just
00:01:46.590 a

00:01:46.770 splash
00:01:46.890 of
00:01:47.280 rice
00:01:47.490 vinegar
00:01:47.520 just
00:01:48.450 to
00:01:48.570 sort
00:01:48.720 of

00:01:48.810 grind
00:01:49.140 it
00:01:49.320 up
00:01:49.380 it's
00:01:49.650 very
00:01:49.800 sweet
00:01:50.220 on
00:01:50.430 its
00:01:50.460 own

00:01:50.759 but
00:01:51.619 it's
00:01:52.619 heard
00:01:52.740 of
00:01:52.830 bouncing
00:01:53.220 then
00:01:54.590 about

00:01:55.650 couple
00:01:55.979 tablespoons
00:01:56.280 of
00:01:56.550 honey
00:01:56.700 more
00:01:57.690 sugar

00:01:58.020 and
00:02:00.979 then
00:02:01.979 we're
00:02:02.490 just
00:02:02.520 put
00:02:02.850 some
00:02:03.090 grants
00:02:04.050 in

00:02:04.170 black
00:02:04.380 pepper
00:02:09.080 and
00:02:10.080 that's
00:02:10.259 pretty
00:02:10.530 much
00:02:10.619 it

00:02:10.800 for
00:02:10.830 a
00:02:11.009 glaze
00:02:11.250 so
00:02:11.850 you
00:02:11.940 can
00:02:12.060 just
00:02:12.180 combine
00:02:12.420 all

00:02:12.660 the
00:02:13.019 ingredients

00:02:33.400 I'll
00:02:34.400 give
00:02:34.700 it
00:02:34.730 a
00:02:34.820 good
00:02:34.940 stir
00:02:35.360 here
00:02:35.690 to
00:02:35.870 make

00:02:36.050 sure
00:02:36.200 everything
00:02:36.500 fixed
00:02:36.800 up
00:02:38.380 man
00:02:39.380 just
00:02:39.740 fish

00:02:40.010 off

00:02:40.670 whoops
00:02:41.210 pouring
00:02:41.810 a
00:02:41.960 little
00:02:42.290 bit
00:02:42.500 of
00:02:42.920 sesame

00:02:43.400 oil
00:02:43.880 a
00:02:44.950 little
00:02:45.950 bit
00:02:46.100 is
00:02:46.280 all
00:02:46.370 I
00:02:46.430 have

00:02:47.260 so
00:02:48.260 now
00:02:48.410 on
00:02:48.560 to
00:02:48.680 the
00:02:48.770 meat
00:02:48.950 so
00:02:49.850 these
00:02:49.970 are
00:02:50.120 just

00:02:50.300 beef
00:02:50.720 short
00:02:51.080 ribs
00:02:51.290 you
00:02:51.560 want
00:02:51.710 them
00:02:51.860 cut
00:02:52.130 across

00:02:52.760 the
00:02:53.120 bone
00:02:54.370 these
00:02:55.370 guys
00:02:55.550 are
00:02:55.850 a
00:02:55.910 little
00:02:56.150 bit

00:02:56.300 bigger
00:02:56.750 than
00:02:57.620 they
00:02:57.800 should
00:02:57.980 be

00:02:58.370 but
00:02:58.640 you
00:02:58.730 can
00:02:58.850 see
00:02:58.970 the
00:02:59.150 defining
00:02:59.630 characters

00:02:59.990 are
00:03:00.140 short
00:03:00.410 ribs
00:03:00.590 got
00:03:00.709 a
00:03:00.740 lot
00:03:00.860 of

00:03:00.950 intramuscular
00:03:01.610 fat
00:03:01.670 so
00:03:02.030 they're
00:03:02.150 very

00:03:02.180 flavorful
00:03:03.110 but
00:03:04.070 unfortunately
00:03:05.200 this
00:03:06.200 muscle

00:03:06.560 gets
00:03:06.709 used
00:03:06.920 a
00:03:07.010 lot
00:03:07.040 so
00:03:09.010 so
00:03:10.010 here
00:03:10.340 I've
00:03:10.550 got

00:03:10.610 about
00:03:10.970 a
00:03:11.030 centimeter
00:03:11.540 thick
00:03:11.600 ones
00:03:12.020 you
00:03:12.709 might

00:03:12.830 want
00:03:13.040 to
00:03:13.070 go
00:03:13.160 a
00:03:13.190 little
00:03:13.280 bit
00:03:13.760 there
00:03:14.000 you
00:03:14.450 want

00:03:14.630 to
00:03:14.660 keep
00:03:14.780 them
00:03:14.990 nice
00:03:15.590 and
00:03:15.650 thin
00:03:16.060 so
00:03:17.060 they're

00:03:17.480 not
00:03:17.600 too
00:03:17.780 tough
00:03:17.930 to
00:03:18.110 eat
00:03:19.150 traditionally
00:03:20.150 what

00:03:20.240 you
00:03:20.270 do
00:03:20.450 is
00:03:20.720 you
00:03:21.020 actually
00:03:21.350 use
00:03:21.470 cuts
00:03:22.280 along
00:03:22.700 a

00:03:23.120 single
00:03:23.510 rib
00:03:23.840 and
00:03:24.080 you
00:03:24.200 butterfly
00:03:24.769 the
00:03:24.830 meat

00:03:25.600 but
00:03:26.600 this
00:03:26.750 way
00:03:26.900 is
00:03:27.200 a
00:03:27.260 lot
00:03:27.530 easier
00:03:27.560 to
00:03:27.860 do
00:03:27.980 this

00:03:29.320 for
00:03:30.320 them
00:03:30.440 as
00:03:30.530 if
00:03:30.680 walk
00:03:30.860 back
00:03:31.070 and
00:03:31.280 marinate

00:03:31.670 for
00:03:31.910 at
00:03:32.330 least
00:03:32.480 an
00:03:32.630 hour
00:03:32.720 or
00:03:32.930 so
00:03:33.140 or
00:03:33.410 overnight

00:03:33.680 you
00:03:34.610 can
00:03:34.640 see
00:03:34.880 that
00:03:35.030 the
00:03:35.120 meat
00:03:35.300 actually
00:03:35.570 turns

00:03:35.930 around
00:03:36.170 there
00:03:36.680 which
00:03:37.640 means
00:03:37.880 that
00:03:38.030 they're

00:03:38.150 good
00:03:38.269 to
00:03:38.390 go
00:03:39.190 so
00:03:40.190 I
00:03:40.610 live
00:03:41.269 in
00:03:41.360 a
