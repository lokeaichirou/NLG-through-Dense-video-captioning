00:00:48.780 we're
00:00:49.559 just
00:00:49.620 going
00:00:49.800 to
00:00:49.829 put
00:00:49.950 this
00:00:50.039 on
00:00:50.250 a
00:00:50.280 medium

00:00:50.760 heat
00:00:50.969 and
00:00:51.360 once
00:00:52.230 it's
00:00:52.469 heated
00:00:52.739 up
00:00:52.949 we're

00:00:53.340 to
00:00:53.430 stick
00:00:53.670 in
00:00:53.789 a
00:00:53.879 little
00:00:54.090 bit
00:00:54.180 of
00:00:54.300 oil
00:00:54.480 followed

00:00:55.440 by
00:00:55.680 one
00:00:56.280 medium
00:00:57.180 onion
00:00:57.300 that
00:00:57.690 we've
00:00:57.809 just

00:00:57.989 diced
00:00:58.260 up
00:00:58.530 roughly
00:00:59.070 and

00:01:01.980 again
00:01:02.250 we
00:01:02.370 just
00:01:02.520 chopped

00:01:02.730 up
00:01:02.879 roughly
00:01:03.180 they
00:01:03.270 don't
00:01:03.390 need
00:01:03.510 to
00:01:03.629 be
00:01:03.780 precise

00:01:04.470 chopping
00:01:05.129 we're
00:01:05.549 going
00:01:05.670 to
00:01:05.729 blend
00:01:05.909 it
00:01:06.030 later

00:01:06.210 so
00:01:06.390 it
00:01:06.450 doesn't
00:01:06.630 really
00:01:06.720 matter
00:01:06.960 and
00:01:07.260 to

00:01:14.909 I

00:01:14.939 said
00:01:15.180 on
00:01:15.330 medium
00:01:15.720 heat
00:01:15.900 until

00:01:17.640 go

00:01:17.790 nice
00:01:17.970 and
00:01:18.240 soft
00:01:18.479 but
00:01:18.689 they
00:01:18.780 hold
00:01:18.960 their
00:01:19.140 shape

00:01:19.170 and
00:01:19.590 the
00:01:20.159 onions
00:01:20.580 should
00:01:20.790 start
00:01:21.060 and
00:01:21.330 browning

00:01:22.080 little
00:01:22.470 bit
00:01:22.560 get

00:02:59.040 before
00:02:59.130 you
00:02:59.430 get
00:02:59.550 to
00:02:59.610 blend
00:02:59.940 it
00:03:01.100 at

00:03:02.100 this
00:03:02.280 point
00:03:02.580 your
00:03:02.730 toes
00:03:03.030 so
00:03:03.630 it
00:03:03.690 should
00:03:03.930 be

00:03:03.980 exactly
00:03:04.980 how
00:03:05.220 you
00:03:05.280 want
00:03:05.520 it
00:03:05.670 so
00:03:05.940 if
00:03:06.630 it's
00:03:06.840 a

00:03:06.930 little
00:03:07.050 bit
00:03:07.200 but
00:03:07.410 you
00:03:07.560 want
00:03:07.620 to
00:03:07.830 add
00:03:07.980 about
00:03:08.250 a

00:03:08.640 little
00:03:09.000 bit
00:03:09.090 of
00:03:09.150 sugar
00:03:09.590 likewise
00:03:10.590 you
00:03:10.860 might

00:03:11.010 want
00:03:11.190 to
00:03:11.220 add
00:03:11.370 a
00:03:11.400 little
00:03:11.580 bit
00:03:11.700 of
00:03:11.730 salt
00:03:12.000 and

00:03:12.090 pepper
00:03:12.150 so
00:03:12.540 you
00:03:12.660 season
00:03:13.050 to
00:03:13.230 your
00:03:14.070 taste
00:03:14.400 and

00:03:14.700 then
00:03:15.540 we
00:03:15.660 could
00:03:15.780 stick
00:03:16.020 this
00:03:16.170 into
00:03:16.560 a
00:03:16.590 blender

00:03:17.130 so
00:03:18.090 blend
00:03:19.019 it
00:03:19.140 all
00:03:19.200 up

00:03:22.320 it'll
00:03:23.010 be
00:03:23.070 a

00:03:23.100 nice
00:03:23.310 smooth
00:03:23.670 consistency
