00:00:08.010 I

00:00:08.040 cannot
00:00:08.370 believe
00:00:08.639 this
00:00:08.820 many
00:00:09.030 summers
00:00:09.450 have

00:00:14.670 shudder
00:00:14.940 to

00:00:15.360 you've

00:00:17.039 offense
00:00:17.119 so
00:00:18.119 I
00:00:18.150 apologize

00:00:18.660 for
00:00:18.690 the
00:00:18.990 delay
00:00:19.140 but
00:00:19.529 hopefully
00:00:20.130 after
00:00:20.250 you

00:00:22.949 forgiven

00:00:23.580 so
00:00:24.090 let's
00:00:24.240 go
00:00:24.359 ahead
00:00:24.420 and
00:00:24.630 get
00:00:24.689 started
00:00:24.810 with

00:00:25.140 the
00:00:25.500 dressing
00:00:25.949 and
00:00:26.220 one
00:00:26.699 of
00:00:26.789 the
00:00:26.849 keys
00:00:27.060 to
00:00:27.090 a

00:00:27.240 great
00:00:27.480 macaroni
00:00:27.930 salad
00:00:28.289 is
00:00:28.380 to
00:00:28.529 do
00:00:28.680 the

00:00:28.859 dressing
00:00:29.099 first
00:00:29.490 for
00:00:30.359 reasons
00:00:30.660 I'll
00:00:30.779 explain

00:00:30.810 in
00:00:31.230 a
00:00:31.289 second
00:00:31.679 so
00:00:32.340 we're
00:00:32.460 gonna
00:00:32.550 start
00:00:32.820 with

00:00:33.000 some
00:00:33.149 mayonnaise
00:00:33.180 and
00:00:33.780 of
00:00:34.200 course
00:00:34.380 we're

00:00:34.500 gonna
00:00:34.559 use
00:00:34.770 real
00:00:35.070 full
00:00:35.610 fat
00:00:35.850 mayonnaise
00:00:36.090 and

00:00:36.570 to
00:00:37.230 the
00:00:37.350 mayonnaise
00:00:37.469 we'll
00:00:37.800 add
00:00:37.920 a
00:00:37.950 couple

00:00:38.010 spoons
00:00:38.489 of
00:00:38.700 Dijon
00:00:39.030 mustard
00:00:39.059 to
00:00:40.020 be
00:00:40.140 honest

00:00:40.350 yellow
00:00:40.590 mustard
00:00:40.890 seems
00:00:41.160 to
00:00:41.309 be
00:00:41.399 more

00:00:41.579 traditional
00:00:42.059 but
00:00:42.480 I
00:00:42.540 really
00:00:42.840 do
00:00:42.960 like
00:00:43.110 the

00:00:43.230 Dijon
00:00:43.379 better
00:00:43.739 here
00:00:43.980 so
00:00:44.610 a
00:00:44.640 little
00:00:44.820 bit
00:00:44.940 of

00:00:45.059 mustard
00:00:45.210 and
00:00:45.660 then
00:00:46.350 we're
00:00:46.440 also
00:00:46.559 going
00:00:46.680 to

00:00:46.739 need
00:00:46.860 some
00:00:46.920 vinegar
00:00:47.190 and
00:00:47.489 for
00:00:48.000 this
00:00:48.149 I'm

00:00:48.300 recommending
00:00:48.570 plain
00:00:49.140 white
00:00:49.620 distilled

00:00:49.890 vinegar
00:00:50.149 and
00:00:51.149 it's
00:00:51.300 not
00:00:51.420 like
00:00:51.510 you're
00:00:51.629 gonna

00:00:51.690 wreck
00:00:51.960 this
00:00:52.110 using
00:00:52.379 a
00:00:52.440 different
00:00:52.739 vinegar
00:00:53.070 but

00:00:53.610 really
00:00:53.789 this
00:00:53.910 is
00:00:53.969 just
00:00:54.270 in
00:00:54.390 here
00:00:54.539 for
00:00:54.690 the

00:00:54.780 acidity
00:00:55.140 and
00:00:55.440 I
00:00:55.829 think
00:00:56.010 we
00:00:56.070 want
00:00:56.250 something

00:00:56.309 that
00:00:56.550 has
00:00:56.670 a
00:00:56.760 neutral
00:00:57.090 flavor
00:00:57.239 and
00:00:58.199 then
00:00:58.320 we'll

00:00:58.440 need
00:00:58.530 to
00:00:58.590 season
00:00:58.890 this
00:00:59.039 up
00:00:59.190 a
00:00:59.280 little
00:00:59.430 bit
00:00:59.579 with

00:01:00.270 a
00:01:00.300 shake
00:01:00.600 of
00:01:00.719 cayenne
00:01:01.020 pepper
00:01:01.260 as
00:01:01.530 well
00:01:02.309 as

00:01:02.399 some
00:01:02.550 freshly
00:01:02.850 ground
00:01:03.090 black
00:01:03.300 pepper
00:01:03.390 and
00:01:04.010 of

00:01:05.010 course
00:01:05.280 some
00:01:05.489 salt
00:01:05.840 and
00:01:06.840 we'll
00:01:06.960 take
00:01:07.080 a
00:01:07.140 whisk

00:01:07.350 and
00:01:07.470 we'll
00:01:07.590 mix
00:01:07.740 that
00:01:07.950 up
00:01:07.979 and
00:01:08.340 that
00:01:08.790 is

00:01:08.970 basically
00:01:09.180 the
00:01:09.540 base
00:01:09.840 of
00:01:10.170 the
00:01:10.290 dressing
00:01:10.710 for

00:01:11.100 this
00:01:11.250 macaroni
00:01:11.700 salad
00:01:12.180 except
00:01:13.110 for
00:01:13.260 one
00:01:13.439 key

00:01:14.090 crucial
00:01:15.090 and
00:01:15.330 controversial
00:01:16.110 ingredient

00:01:16.770 sugar
00:01:17.509 so
00:01:18.509 while
00:01:18.630 it
00:01:18.720 is
00:01:18.810 true
00:01:18.869 that
00:01:19.080 your

00:01:19.290 classic
00:01:19.770 American
00:01:20.369 deli
00:01:20.670 style
00:01:20.820 macaroni

00:01:21.540 salad
00:01:21.930 does
00:01:22.320 use
00:01:22.530 sort
00:01:22.890 of
00:01:22.950 a
00:01:23.070 sweet
00:01:23.250 dressing

00:01:23.729 I
00:01:23.909 find
00:01:24.630 that
00:01:24.720 the
00:01:24.840 most
00:01:24.960 popular
00:01:25.200 recipes
00:01:25.650 out

00:01:25.920 there
00:01:25.979 call
00:01:26.400 for
00:01:26.670 way
00:01:26.880 way
00:01:27.299 too
00:01:27.360 much
00:01:27.720 like
00:01:28.500 a

00:01:28.560 half
00:01:28.799 a
00:01:28.920 cup
00:01:29.130 or
00:01:29.310 two-thirds
00:01:29.729 of
00:01:29.880 a
00:01:29.939 cup
00:01:29.970 of

00:01:30.150 sugar
00:01:30.390 so
00:01:31.079 I'm
00:01:31.229 only
00:01:31.350 gonna
00:01:31.560 call
00:01:31.770 for
00:01:31.950 one
00:01:32.100 or

00:01:32.220 two
00:01:32.340 tablespoons
00:01:32.909 which
00:01:33.570 I
00:01:33.720 think
00:01:33.930 provides

00:01:34.229 plenty
00:01:34.439 of
00:01:34.590 sweetness
00:01:35.009 especially
00:01:35.700 since

00:01:35.880 we're
00:01:36.000 gonna
00:01:36.090 add
00:01:36.270 lots
00:01:36.479 of
00:01:36.630 sweet
00:01:36.869 vegetables

00:01:37.409 and
00:01:37.979 once
00:01:38.220 that's
00:01:38.369 all
00:01:38.520 mixed
00:01:38.729 together
00:01:38.880 the

00:01:39.329 liquid
00:01:39.750 portion
00:01:39.930 of
00:01:40.200 our
00:01:40.320 dressing
00:01:40.680 is
00:01:40.740 done

00:01:40.920 and
00:01:41.159 we
00:01:41.640 have
00:01:41.790 to
00:01:41.909 move
00:01:42.000 on
00:01:42.180 to
00:01:42.360 the
00:01:42.479 solids

00:01:42.930 also
00:01:43.409 known
00:01:43.740 as
00:01:43.890 our
00:01:44.040 diced
00:01:44.220 veggies
00:01:44.430 so
00:01:45.119 we'll

00:01:45.240 start
00:01:45.390 with
00:01:45.479 a
00:01:45.600 whole
00:01:45.720 bunch

00:01:47.399 well
00:01:47.670 as
00:01:47.759 some
00:01:47.909 grated
00:01:48.210 carrot
00:01:48.570 and

00:01:48.780 then
00:01:49.409 we
00:01:49.500 want
00:01:49.649 a
00:01:49.710 little
00:01:49.829 bit

00:01:54.240 just
00:01:54.450 regular
00:01:54.570 onion
00:01:54.990 will
00:01:55.140 work
00:01:55.320 fine
00:01:55.590 and

00:01:55.829 then
00:01:56.369 for

00:02:16.650 ok
00:02:17.430 the

00:02:17.580 salt
00:02:17.819 the
00:02:18.000 sugar
00:02:18.180 the
00:02:18.450 acid
00:02:18.840 is
00:02:19.020 gonna
00:02:19.470 pull

00:02:19.740 liquid
00:02:20.100 out
00:02:20.250 of
00:02:20.280 those
00:02:20.430 vegetables
00:02:21.030 it's

00:02:21.600 gonna
00:02:21.750 sort
00:02:22.020 of
00:02:22.110 firm
00:02:22.380 up
00:02:22.530 and
00:02:22.709 crisp
00:02:22.950 up
00:02:23.100 the

00:02:23.280 texture
00:02:23.700 and
00:02:23.880 I
00:02:24.270 really
00:02:24.450 do
00:02:24.569 think
00:02:24.750 it
00:02:24.840 makes
00:02:24.930 a

00:02:25.080 little
00:02:25.290 bit
00:02:25.410 of
00:02:25.470 a
00:02:25.560 difference
00:02:25.890 and
00:02:26.490 besides

00:02:26.819 no
00:02:26.970 one
00:02:27.090 can
00:02:27.209 really
00:02:27.420 prove
00:02:27.569 otherwise

00:02:28.200 and
00:02:28.620 once
00:02:28.800 that's
00:02:28.920 mixed
00:02:29.130 we'll
00:02:29.340 just
00:02:29.520 pop

00:02:29.700 that
00:02:29.730 in
00:02:30.000 the
00:02:30.060 fridge
00:02:30.270 while

00:02:31.470 macaroni

00:02:32.280 I'm
00:02:32.580 just
00:02:32.730 gonna
00:02:32.820 leave
00:02:33.000 that

00:02:33.060 spatula
00:02:33.360 right
00:02:33.750 in
00:02:33.900 there
00:02:34.080 because

00:02:34.650 are

00:02:34.740 gonna
00:02:34.860 use

00:02:35.190 to
00:02:35.370 mix
00:02:35.520 the
00:02:35.640 salad
00:02:35.820 up

00:02:40.350 what
00:02:40.470 we
00:02:40.560 have

00:02:40.709 here

00:02:40.980 one
00:02:41.130 pound
00:02:41.370 of
00:02:41.550 elbow
00:02:41.820 macaroni

00:02:41.930 that's
00:02:42.930 about
00:02:43.140 4
00:02:43.380 cups
00:02:43.560 and
00:02:44.040 we
00:02:44.400 are
00:02:44.489 gonna

00:02:44.610 cook
00:02:44.819 this
00:02:45.000 in
00:02:45.150 some
00:02:45.330 generously
00:02:45.870 salted

00:02:46.320 boiling
00:02:46.500 water
00:02:46.739 and
00:02:47.190 I
00:02:47.610 said
00:02:47.820 cook
00:02:48.120 not
00:02:48.480 under

00:02:48.810 cook
00:02:49.020 we're
00:02:49.590 gonna
00:02:49.680 cook
00:02:49.920 this
00:02:50.010 all
00:02:50.220 the
00:02:50.310 way

00:02:50.430 just
00:02:50.850 like
00:02:50.970 as
00:02:51.120 if
00:02:51.239 we
00:02:51.300 were
00:02:51.450 gonna
00:02:51.570 eat
00:02:51.660 this

00:02:51.870 hot
00:02:52.050 I
00:02:52.380 don't
00:02:52.950 have
00:02:53.040 any
00:02:53.160 idea
00:02:53.459 who
00:02:53.610 came
00:02:53.820 up

00:02:53.940 with
00:02:53.970 the
00:02:54.120 notion
00:02:54.269 that
00:02:54.480 you're
00:02:54.720 supposed
00:02:54.930 to

00:02:54.959 under
00:02:55.230 cook
00:02:55.440 pasta
00:02:55.830 for
00:02:56.010 a
00:02:56.040 salad
00:02:56.430 but
00:02:56.940 it's

00:02:57.090 just
00:02:57.300 not
00:02:57.420 true

00:02:57.959 unless
00:02:58.350 you
00:02:58.440 want
00:02:58.650 a
00:02:58.739 horrible
00:02:59.070 gummy
00:02:59.340 texture

00:02:59.760 macaroni
00:03:00.269 salad
00:03:00.660 I
00:03:00.870 mean
00:03:01.140 who
00:03:01.260 knows
00:03:01.380 maybe

00:03:01.620 you
00:03:01.830 do
00:03:02.010 but
00:03:02.550 assuming
00:03:02.880 you
00:03:02.970 want
00:03:03.150 an

00:03:03.269 enjoyable
00:03:03.690 texture
00:03:04.170 I
00:03:04.290 recommend
00:03:04.739 cooking
00:03:04.860 at

00:03:05.130 the
00:03:05.220 full
00:03:05.400 time
00:03:05.640 at
00:03:06.330 which
00:03:06.450 point
00:03:06.660 we're
00:03:06.750 gonna

00:03:06.840 drain
00:03:07.110 that
00:03:07.290 very
00:03:07.620 very
00:03:07.980 well
00:03:08.330 so
00:03:09.330 let's
00:03:09.480 pour

00:03:09.690 that
00:03:09.810 into
00:03:09.989 a
00:03:10.080 colander
00:03:10.410 to
00:03:10.620 let
00:03:10.769 it
00:03:10.890 drain
00:03:11.130 and

00:03:11.720 do
00:03:12.720 not
00:03:12.930 under
00:03:13.380 any
00:03:13.530 circumstances
00:03:14.430 rinse

00:03:14.820 this
00:03:15.150 pasta
00:03:15.780 for
00:03:16.530 this
00:03:16.650 particular
00:03:16.920 salad

00:03:17.489 that
00:03:17.640 is
00:03:17.670 the
00:03:17.940 biggest
00:03:18.120 mistake
00:03:18.269 you
00:03:18.690 could

00:03:18.840 make
00:03:18.900 so
00:03:19.769 don't
00:03:19.980 do
00:03:20.100 it
00:03:20.250 just
00:03:20.519 let
00:03:20.640 this
00:03:20.790 sit

00:03:21.000 and
00:03:21.030 drain
00:03:21.269 for
00:03:21.420 about
00:03:21.600 five
00:03:21.840 minutes
00:03:22.049 and

00:03:22.470 every
00:03:23.220 so
00:03:23.370 often
00:03:23.549 I
00:03:23.700 want
00:03:23.850 you
00:03:23.940 to
00:03:24.030 give
00:03:24.150 it
00:03:24.239 the

00:03:24.329 old
00:03:24.360 shake
00:03:25.140 of
00:03:25.290 sheikha
00:03:25.500 which
00:03:26.370 is
00:03:26.489 gonna
00:03:26.670 help

00:03:26.880 knock
00:03:27.030 off
00:03:27.209 some
00:03:27.390 of
00:03:27.420 that
00:03:27.510 water
00:03:27.780 and
00:03:28.049 once

00:03:28.590 we're
00:03:28.739 convinced
00:03:29.100 our
00:03:29.190 macaroni
00:03:29.610 is
00:03:29.850 very

00:03:30.180 very
00:03:30.480 well
00:03:30.660 drained
00:03:31.019 we
00:03:31.799 will
00:03:31.950 transfer
00:03:32.310 that

00:03:32.430 into
00:03:32.670 a
00:03:32.700 large
00:03:32.970 mixing
00:03:33.329 bowl
00:03:33.390 and
00:03:33.780 proceed

00:03:34.470 with
00:03:34.500 probably
00:03:35.100 the
00:03:35.220 most
00:03:35.400 important
00:03:35.880 step
00:03:36.060 of

00:03:36.180 this
00:03:36.269 whole
00:03:36.420 process
00:03:36.660 the
00:03:37.470 tossing
00:03:37.950 and

00:03:38.160 cooling
00:03:38.430 of
00:03:38.549 the
00:03:38.579 macaroni
00:03:39.090 what
00:03:39.870 we'll
00:03:39.989 do
00:03:40.079 is

00:03:40.140 we'll
00:03:40.260 take
00:03:40.440 our
00:03:40.560 spatula
00:03:40.980 from
00:03:41.130 the
00:03:41.280 dressing

00:03:41.519 and
00:03:41.880 we'll
00:03:42.570 use
00:03:42.690 that
00:03:42.810 to
00:03:42.870 toss
00:03:43.200 this
00:03:43.350 macaroni

00:03:43.769 occasionally
00:03:44.489 until
00:03:45.060 it
00:03:45.209 cools
00:03:45.420 down
00:03:45.510 to
00:03:45.780 just

00:03:45.989 about
00:03:46.200 room
00:03:46.440 temp
00:03:46.739 and
00:03:47.220 while
00:03:47.400 we're
00:03:47.519 using

00:03:47.640 the
00:03:47.790 spatula
00:03:48.000 from
00:03:48.360 the
00:03:48.450 dressing
00:03:48.930 we're

00:03:49.260 definitely
00:03:49.440 not
00:03:49.620 gonna
00:03:49.829 add
00:03:50.010 any
00:03:50.160 dressing

00:03:50.670 until
00:03:51.120 this
00:03:51.239 has
00:03:51.480 cooled
00:03:51.780 down
00:03:51.870 all
00:03:52.590 right
00:03:52.709 if

00:03:52.799 you
00:03:52.890 had
00:03:53.040 a
00:03:53.070 mayonnaise-based
00:03:53.400 dressing
00:03:53.730 too

00:03:54.239 hot
00:03:54.480 macaroni
00:03:54.989 which
00:03:55.500 you'll
00:03:55.650 end
00:03:55.829 up
00:03:55.890 with
00:03:56.040 is

00:03:56.190 a
00:03:56.220 very
00:03:56.370 greasy
00:03:56.940 macaroni
00:03:57.900 salad
00:03:58.380 and
00:03:58.560 what's

00:03:59.190 gonna
00:03:59.310 happen
00:03:59.610 here
00:03:59.700 is
00:03:59.820 you're
00:03:59.940 tossing
00:04:00.150 and

00:04:00.480 cooling
00:04:00.870 a
00:04:01.079 very
00:04:01.590 fine
00:04:01.799 layer
00:04:02.040 of
00:04:02.070 starch
00:04:02.430 is

00:04:02.579 going
00:04:02.700 to
00:04:02.760 form
00:04:03.060 on
00:04:03.209 each
00:04:03.360 one
00:04:03.540 of
00:04:03.600 those

00:04:03.720 pieces
00:04:03.989 of
00:04:04.110 macaroni
00:04:04.500 and
00:04:04.890 that
00:04:05.250 thin
00:04:05.459 layer

00:04:05.579 starch
00:04:06.000 has
00:04:06.180 been
00:04:06.360 proven
00:04:06.900 to
00:04:07.110 more

00:04:07.260 effectively
00:04:07.799 grab
00:04:08.700 on
00:04:08.940 and
00:04:08.970 hold
00:04:09.420 on
00:04:09.600 to
00:04:09.989 that

00:04:10.109 mayonnaise-based
00:04:10.590 dressing
00:04:10.980 it's
00:04:11.970 true

00:04:12.209 they've
00:04:12.420 done
00:04:12.570 studies
00:04:12.959 where
00:04:13.709 the
00:04:14.519 Mayo

00:04:16.499 but
00:04:17.499 anyway
00:04:17.680 like
00:04:17.829 I
00:04:17.979 said
00:04:18.129 we
00:04:18.249 want
00:04:18.430 to
00:04:18.489 cool

00:04:18.639 that
00:04:18.789 down
00:04:18.819 to
00:04:19.150 about
00:04:19.180 room
00:04:19.539 temperature
00:04:19.569 and

00:04:20.560 if
00:04:21.280 everything's
00:04:21.669 gone
00:04:21.819 according
00:04:21.879 to
00:04:22.270 plan

00:04:22.409 those
00:04:23.409 pieces
00:04:23.710 of
00:04:23.919 macaroni
00:04:24.039 should
00:04:24.580 just
00:04:24.819 be

00:04:24.939 tacky
00:04:25.270 enough
00:04:25.479 to
00:04:25.749 stick
00:04:25.990 to
00:04:26.110 your
00:04:26.199 hand
00:04:27.419 so

00:04:28.419 that's
00:04:28.599 perfect
00:04:28.749 right
00:04:29.080 there
00:04:29.110 and
00:04:29.879 yes
00:04:30.879 I

00:04:31.060 will
00:04:31.120 stop
00:04:31.389 touching
00:04:31.719 the
00:04:31.749 macaroni
00:04:32.169 now
00:04:32.379 and

00:04:32.699 at
00:04:33.699 this

00:04:52.539 macaroni
00:04:52.840 has

00:04:53.379 absorbed
00:04:53.830 the

00:04:59.620 least
00:04:59.949 four

00:05:00.310 hours
00:05:00.340 but
00:05:01.180 overnight

00:05:01.779 best
00:05:01.919 which
00:05:02.919 is
00:05:03.069 how

00:05:06.279 it
00:05:06.310 out
00:05:06.460 it

00:05:06.699 should

00:05:07.870 like
00:05:08.020 this

00:06:07.029 on
00:06:07.270 top
00:06:07.300 I
00:06:07.719 don't
00:06:08.080 think
00:06:08.229 so
00:06:08.409 so
00:06:09.039 I
00:06:09.069 did

00:06:09.279 a
00:06:09.310 little

00:06:10.180 final
00:06:10.479 touch

00:06:10.689 and
00:06:11.020 that's
00:06:11.620 it
00:06:11.889 my
00:06:12.430 take
00:06:12.699 on
00:06:12.849 the
00:06:13.000 classic

00:06:13.210 all-american
00:06:14.169 macaroni
00:06:14.649 salad
00:06:15.099 is
00:06:15.219 done
00:06:15.490 and

00:06:16.120 I
00:06:16.599 realize
00:06:16.930 taste
00:06:17.169 is
00:06:17.289 subjective
00:06:17.439 but
00:06:18.310 for
00:06:18.490 me

00:06:18.580 this
00:06:18.729 is
00:06:18.879 just
00:06:18.909 the
00:06:19.149 epitome
00:06:19.270 of
00:06:19.750 the
00:06:20.379 classic

00:06:20.800 American
00:06:20.949 macaroni
00:06:21.669 salad
00:06:22.120 slightly
00:06:23.020 but
00:06:23.229 not

00:06:23.349 too
00:06:23.560 sweet

00:06:24.189 with
00:06:24.580 just
00:06:24.789 the
00:06:24.879 right
00:06:25.029 level
00:06:25.209 of
00:06:25.360 acidity
00:06:25.810 and

00:06:26.110 a
00:06:26.560 very
00:06:26.769 generous
00:06:27.159 amount
00:06:27.279 of
00:06:27.490 vegetables
00:06:27.879 as

00:06:28.149 well
00:06:28.659 as
00:06:28.779 a
00:06:28.899 beautiful
00:06:29.409 silky
00:06:29.860 creamy

00:06:30.420 field
00:06:30.780 because
00:06:31.140 we
00:06:31.290 didn't
00:06:31.650 dress
00:06:31.800 that

00:06:31.980 macaroni
00:06:32.370 hot
00:06:32.670 but
00:06:33.420 anyway
00:06:33.630 that's
00:06:33.840 it
00:06:34.020 my

00:06:34.470 version
00:06:34.710 of
00:06:34.920 the
00:06:35.040 classic
00:06:35.550 American
00:06:35.670 macaroni

00:06:36.420 salad
00:06:36.870 and
00:06:37.110 of
00:06:37.680 course
00:06:37.980 this
00:06:38.160 is
00:06:38.310 gonna
00:06:38.430 pair

00:06:38.730 beautifully
00:06:39.060 with
00:06:39.420 anything
00:06:39.900 you
00:06:39.990 barbecue

00:06:40.530 grill
00:06:40.860 or
00:06:41.010 smoked
00:06:41.370 this
00:06:41.580 summer
00:06:41.850 I
00:06:42.180 probably

00:06:42.960 should
00:06:43.170 have
00:06:43.200 done
00:06:43.290 that
00:06:43.470 in
00:06:43.530 a
00:06:43.650 different

00:06:43.920 order
00:06:44.130 but
00:06:44.280 anyway
00:06:45.000 the
00:06:45.120 point
00:06:45.270 is
00:06:45.450 I

00:06:45.960 hope
