00:00:56.160 really
00:00:56.700 French
00:00:57.000 but
00:00:57.420 feel

00:01:04.710 use
00:01:05.010 higher
00:01:05.520 welfare

00:01:07.260 higher
00:01:07.710 welfare
00:01:08.100 pop
00:01:08.550 what
00:01:08.880 this
00:01:09.300 is
00:01:09.450 the

00:01:09.540 autosuggestion
00:01:10.290 method
00:01:10.650 I
00:01:10.830 think
00:01:11.310 it
00:01:11.430 will

00:01:11.610 work
00:01:11.670 I
00:01:12.360 believe
00:01:13.320 so

00:01:13.830 afterwards
00:01:14.520 another
00:01:14.910 slice
00:01:15.270 of
00:01:15.479 cheese
00:01:15.690 you

00:01:16.170 see
00:01:16.350 the
00:01:16.470 cheese
00:01:16.740 is
00:01:16.920 the
00:01:17.100 glue
00:01:17.430 of
00:01:17.580 this

00:01:17.759 sandwich
00:01:18.030 finish
00:01:18.869 him
00:01:19.050 with
00:01:19.080 the
00:01:19.290 other
00:01:19.470 slice

00:01:19.740 of
00:01:19.770 bread
00:01:19.950 this
00:01:20.640 time
00:01:20.880 better
00:01:21.180 side
00:01:21.509 up
00:01:22.820 to

00:01:23.820 stay
00:01:24.030 classic
00:01:24.420 we
00:01:24.540 will
00:01:24.720 grill
00:01:24.990 this
00:01:25.140 sandwich

00:01:25.440 in
00:01:25.740 a
00:01:25.800 pan
00:01:26.070 and
00:01:26.280 not
00:01:26.520 in
00:01:26.640 a
00:01:26.700 toaster
00:01:27.119 like
00:01:27.750 I
00:01:27.780 did

00:01:28.170 in
00:01:28.290 the
00:01:28.440 past
00:01:28.619 with
00:01:28.800 some
00:01:28.830 fat
00:01:29.490 success
00:01:29.700 but

00:01:30.360 don't
00:01:30.600 get
00:01:30.720 me
00:01:30.869 wrong
00:01:30.900 I
00:01:31.170 still
00:01:31.200 believe
00:01:31.650 that

00:01:31.680 the
00:01:31.890 toaster
00:01:32.310 method
00:01:32.640 is
00:01:32.820 the
00:01:33.119 less
00:01:33.270 chaotic

00:01:33.869 one
00:01:34.640 unless
00:01:35.640 your
00:01:35.880 kitchen
00:01:36.390 starts
00:01:36.780 to
00:01:36.990 burn

00:01:37.190 unless
00:01:38.190 your
00:01:38.430 kitchen
00:01:38.940 starts
00:01:39.330 to
00:01:39.420 burn
00:01:39.660 right

00:01:40.380 and
00:01:40.680 it
00:01:40.890 starts
00:01:41.250 to
00:01:41.399 spread
00:01:41.640 unless
00:01:42.509 your

00:01:42.750 kitchen
00:01:43.229 starts
00:01:43.590 to
00:01:43.740 burn
00:01:44.010 right
00:01:44.670 and
00:01:45.030 it

00:01:45.210 starts
00:01:45.570 to
00:01:45.690 spread
00:01:46.020 unless
00:01:46.890 your
00:01:47.130 kitchen

00:01:47.610 starts
00:01:47.970 to
00:01:48.120 burn
00:01:48.420 right
00:01:49.020 and
00:01:49.380 it
00:01:49.590 starts
00:01:49.920 to

00:01:50.070 spread
00:01:50.960 frying
00:01:51.960 pan
00:01:52.229 on
00:01:52.440 medium
00:01:52.830 heat

00:01:53.040 sandwich
00:01:53.729 goes
00:01:53.970 in
00:01:54.180 and
00:01:54.390 simply
00:01:54.600 cover
00:01:54.930 it

00:01:55.110 loosely
00:01:55.320 with
00:01:55.590 aluminium
00:01:56.220 foil
00:01:56.430 no
00:01:56.880 lead
00:01:57.090 is

00:01:57.240 needed
00:01:57.570 because
00:01:57.720 it
00:01:57.900 would
00:01:58.080 create
00:01:58.380 too
00:01:58.620 much

00:01:58.799 steam
00:01:59.130 thus
00:01:59.460 making
00:01:59.700 the
00:01:59.940 sandwich
00:02:00.299 goes
00:02:00.510 so

00:02:00.870 deep
00:02:02.090 fry
00:02:03.090 it
00:02:03.150 for
00:02:03.240 about
00:02:03.479 2
00:02:03.810 minutes
00:02:03.930 each

00:02:04.229 side
00:02:04.650 but
00:02:05.130 check
00:02:05.370 occasionally
00:02:10.220 at
00:02:11.220 the
00:02:11.400 end

00:02:11.519 it
00:02:11.640 should
00:02:11.790 be
00:02:11.970 golden
00:02:12.180 and
00:02:12.390 crispy
00:02:13.019 don't

00:02:13.500 brush
00:02:13.739 it
00:02:13.920 meaning
00:02:14.459 do
00:02:14.580 not
00:02:14.880 set
00:02:15.150 the
00:02:15.269 heat
00:02:15.450 too

00:02:15.660 high
00:02:15.690 otherwise
00:02:16.110 it
00:02:16.650 will
00:02:17.040 burn
00:02:18.860 so

00:02:19.860 personally
00:02:20.400 I
00:02:20.430 do
00:02:20.640 like
00:02:20.970 the
00:02:21.150 croque
00:02:21.330 monsieur

00:02:21.450 as
00:02:21.750 it
00:02:22.110 is
00:02:22.320 nothing
00:02:22.980 more
00:02:23.310 but
00:02:23.790 sometimes

00:02:24.209 people
00:02:24.420 find
00:02:24.780 it
00:02:24.900 too
00:02:25.049 dry
00:02:25.200 so
00:02:25.590 let's
00:02:26.070 make
00:02:26.280 a

00:02:26.310 white
00:02:26.640 and
00:02:26.880 cream
00:02:27.269 sauce
00:02:27.510 to
00:02:27.540 go
00:02:27.750 with
00:02:27.780 it
00:02:27.959 in

00:02:28.320 french
00:02:28.980 we
00:02:29.190 call
00:02:29.340 it
00:02:29.489 bechamel
00:02:30.180 sauce
00:02:30.209 but

00:02:30.660 don't
00:02:30.870 be
00:02:30.959 scared
00:02:31.230 really
00:02:31.440 because
00:02:31.860 i
00:02:32.100 do
00:02:32.370 have

00:02:32.910 the
00:02:33.510 perfect
00:02:33.720 cheek
00:02:34.140 color
00:02:35.209 to

00:02:36.209 microwave-safe
00:02:36.750 cups
00:02:37.410 1
00:02:38.400 tablespoon
00:02:39.060 butter

00:02:39.209 in
00:02:39.480 the
00:02:39.600 first
00:02:39.810 one
00:02:39.989 and
00:02:40.230 a
00:02:40.440 good
00:02:40.560 dash
00:02:40.769 of
00:02:40.890 milk

00:02:41.070 in
00:02:41.340 the
00:02:41.430 second
00:02:41.790 one
00:02:41.970 pop
00:02:42.480 them
00:02:42.690 in
00:02:42.870 the

00:02:42.989 microwave
00:02:43.019 for
00:02:43.769 1
00:02:43.950 minute
00:02:43.980 and
00:02:44.370 a
00:02:44.400 half

00:02:47.349 afterwards
00:02:48.560 one
00:02:49.010 tablespoon
00:02:49.400 flour
00:02:49.760 goes
00:02:50.209 in

00:02:50.450 the
00:02:50.599 butter
00:02:50.810 mix
00:02:51.500 well
00:02:51.769 and
00:02:52.040 add
00:02:52.189 the
00:02:52.430 hot
00:02:52.610 milk

00:02:52.640 then
00:02:53.599 pop
00:02:53.840 this
00:02:54.049 mix
00:02:54.319 20
00:02:54.920 to
00:02:55.069 30
00:02:55.310 seconds
00:02:55.760 in

00:02:55.879 the
00:02:56.060 microwave
00:02:56.180 to
00:02:56.780 thicken
00:02:57.049 up
00:03:03.879 at
00:03:04.879 the
00:03:05.120 end

00:03:05.209 it's
00:03:05.390 80%
00:03:05.750 similar
00:03:06.319 to
00:03:06.439 a
00:03:06.470 fancy
00:03:06.920 French

00:03:07.129 bechamel
00:03:07.700 sauce
00:03:07.730 but
00:03:08.480 for
00:03:08.659 only
00:03:08.989 20%
00:03:09.500 of
00:03:09.950 the

00:03:10.069 original
00:03:10.670 time
00:03:13.120 okay
00:03:14.120 so
00:03:14.150 how
00:03:14.569 to
00:03:14.599 play
00:03:14.930 this

00:03:15.079 out
00:03:15.290 well
00:03:15.590 in
00:03:15.709 Paris
00:03:16.040 it's
00:03:16.250 often
00:03:16.579 done
00:03:16.730 like

00:03:16.939 so
00:03:17.150 just
00:03:17.540 spread
00:03:17.989 with
00:03:18.200 bechamel
