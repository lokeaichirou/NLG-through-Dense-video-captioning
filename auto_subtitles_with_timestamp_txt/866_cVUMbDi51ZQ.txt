00:03:27.080 you
00:03:27.110 like
00:03:27.380 does
00:03:28.100 it's
00:03:28.400 more
00:03:28.610 of
00:03:28.700 a
00:03:28.760 trial
00:03:29.090 and

00:03:29.239 error
00:03:29.420 kind
00:03:29.750 of
00:03:29.840 thing
00:03:31.720 so
00:03:32.720 we'll
00:03:32.870 blend
00:03:33.170 this

00:03:33.410 up
00:03:36.340 now
00:03:37.340 what
00:03:37.459 I
00:03:37.489 want
00:03:37.670 to
00:03:37.730 do
00:03:37.790 is
00:03:37.880 go
00:03:38.030 in
00:03:38.180 and

00:03:38.300 scrape
00:03:38.690 this
00:03:38.870 down
00:03:39.550 now

00:03:41.480 a
00:03:41.720 little
00:03:42.020 thick
00:03:42.260 and
00:03:42.290 so
00:03:42.560 I
00:03:42.590 may

00:03:42.920 thin
00:03:43.190 it
00:03:43.340 down
00:03:43.489 a
00:03:43.550 little
00:03:43.730 bit
00:03:43.880 with
00:03:44.120 some

00:03:44.150 water
00:03:44.600 to
00:03:45.440 get
00:03:45.560 the
00:03:45.680 consistency
00:03:45.709 a
00:03:46.430 little

00:03:46.760 thinner
00:03:48.670 so
00:03:49.670 you
00:03:49.760 can
00:03:49.910 see
00:03:50.090 right
00:03:50.269 here
00:03:50.330 that

00:03:50.510 this
00:03:50.750 is
00:03:50.959 really
00:03:51.350 really
00:03:51.500 thick
00:03:51.890 and
00:03:52.780 that

00:03:53.780 doesn't
00:03:54.110 make
00:03:54.230 for
00:03:54.380 a
00:03:54.440 good
00:03:54.470 dipping
00:03:54.860 sauce

00:03:55.070 does
00:03:55.340 it
00:03:55.489 so
00:03:56.239 we're
00:03:56.360 going
00:03:56.450 to
00:03:56.540 add
00:03:56.660 a
00:03:56.690 little

00:03:56.870 water
00:03:56.959 to
00:03:57.230 that
00:03:57.530 and
00:03:57.799 by
00:03:58.700 a
00:03:58.730 little
00:03:58.910 I
00:03:59.090 mean

00:03:59.120 make
00:03:59.420 probably
00:03:59.930 a
00:03:59.959 tablespoon
00:04:01.150 and
00:04:02.150 we're

00:04:02.630 just
00:04:02.750 going
00:04:02.930 to
00:04:02.989 work
00:04:03.200 it
00:04:03.410 in
00:04:03.760 until
00:04:04.760 we
00:04:04.910 get

00:04:05.030 the
00:04:05.150 consistency
00:04:05.870 we
00:04:06.110 want
00:04:06.640 so
00:04:07.640 just
00:04:07.940 keep

00:04:08.299 stirring
00:04:08.540 it
00:04:08.750 around
00:04:08.840 it's
00:04:09.590 getting
00:04:09.950 there
00:04:10.130 I

00:04:10.390 think
00:04:11.390 I'm
00:04:11.450 going
00:04:11.540 to
00:04:11.600 add
00:04:11.720 just
00:04:11.840 a
00:04:11.989 little
00:04:12.200 bit

00:04:12.320 more
00:04:12.530 water
00:04:13.150 and
00:04:14.150 of
00:04:14.269 course
00:04:14.450 if
00:04:14.570 you
00:04:14.660 want
00:04:14.840 it

00:04:14.930 even
00:04:15.049 thinner
00:04:15.320 that's
00:04:15.590 good
00:04:15.769 but
00:04:15.920 I
00:04:15.950 think

00:04:16.160 this
00:04:16.280 is
00:04:16.430 a
00:04:16.459 nice
00:04:16.729 consistency
00:04:17.570 here
00:04:18.010 and
00:04:19.010 this

00:04:19.790 will
00:04:19.970 we'll
00:04:20.180 just
00:04:20.359 set
00:04:20.630 this
00:04:20.750 aside
00:04:20.930 until

00:04:21.500 we're
00:04:21.709 ready
00:04:21.829 to
00:04:21.979 eat

00:04:23.090 our
00:04:23.300 spring
00:04:23.600 rolls
00:04:24.160 now
00:04:25.160 that
00:04:25.340 we
00:04:25.430 have
00:04:25.610 our

00:04:25.760 peanut
00:04:26.270 sauce
00:04:26.510 made
00:04:26.870 now
00:04:27.320 we
00:04:27.380 just
00:04:27.710 need
00:04:27.860 to

00:04:27.950 chop
00:04:28.220 up
00:04:28.460 and
00:04:28.729 get
00:04:28.820 everything
00:04:29.120 prepared
00:04:29.450 so

00:04:30.200 it's
00:04:30.440 ready
00:04:30.710 to
00:04:30.800 go
00:04:30.919 into
00:04:31.520 the
00:04:31.850 spring
00:04:32.030 rolls

00:04:32.330 so
00:04:33.200 let's
00:04:33.380 start
00:04:33.590 off
00:04:33.710 with
00:04:33.890 our
00:04:33.919 onions
00:04:34.310 go

00:04:34.430 ahead
00:04:34.700 and
00:04:34.850 chop
00:04:35.060 off
00:04:35.240 the
00:04:35.960 root
00:04:36.140 end
00:04:36.169 and
00:04:36.880 a

00:04:37.880 little
00:04:38.180 bit
00:04:38.270 of
00:04:38.390 the
00:04:38.479 other
00:04:38.600 end
00:04:40.750 and
00:04:41.750 you
00:04:41.810 just

00:04:41.870 want
00:04:42.169 to
00:04:42.229 dice
00:04:42.440 this
00:04:42.770 up
00:04:43.600 the
00:04:44.600 other
00:04:44.630 option

00:04:45.169 could
00:04:45.200 would
00:04:45.680 be
00:04:45.890 and
00:04:46.370 I
00:04:46.520 find
00:04:46.760 this
00:04:46.850 easier
00:04:47.210 is

00:04:47.390 to
00:04:47.419 you
00:04:48.200 know
00:04:48.229 cut
00:04:48.530 this
00:04:48.650 into
00:04:48.919 strips
00:04:49.100 but
00:04:49.400 I

00:04:49.460 think
00:04:49.700 cutting
00:04:49.910 it
00:04:50.090 and
00:04:50.270 dicing
00:04:50.660 it
00:04:51.100 works

00:04:52.100 well
00:04:53.229 now
00:04:54.229 for
00:04:54.289 the
00:04:54.500 carrots
00:04:54.830 you
00:04:54.950 have
00:04:55.070 a

00:04:55.099 couple
00:04:55.400 of
00:04:55.580 different
00:04:55.669 options
00:04:56.979 you
00:04:57.979 can

00:04:58.130 either
00:04:58.250 peel
00:04:58.580 them
00:04:58.760 or
00:04:58.849 not

00:04:59.210 I
00:04:59.240 didn't
00:04:59.660 peel
00:04:59.840 this
00:05:00.020 one
00:05:00.169 because
00:05:00.440 it's

00:05:00.680 Danika
00:05:01.039 and
00:05:01.900 one
00:05:02.900 option
00:05:03.320 is
00:05:03.500 if
00:05:03.710 you
00:05:03.830 have
00:05:04.070 a

00:05:05.199 peeler
00:05:06.199 like
00:05:06.410 this
00:05:06.620 one
00:05:06.830 it
00:05:06.979 has
00:05:07.130 the
00:05:07.160 ridges

00:05:07.669 right
00:05:07.820 here
00:05:08.090 I'll
00:05:08.360 show
00:05:08.600 you
00:05:08.630 what
00:05:08.720 how
00:05:09.020 it

00:05:09.080 works
00:05:11.680 you
00:05:12.680 see
00:05:12.710 how
00:05:12.949 it
00:05:13.070 just
00:05:13.250 makes
00:05:13.880 little

00:05:14.090 julienne
00:05:14.570 pieces
00:05:15.020 it's
00:05:15.199 really
00:05:15.470 nice
00:05:15.620 they're

00:05:15.889 nice
00:05:16.070 and
00:05:16.310 small
00:05:16.610 I
00:05:16.970 personally
00:05:17.810 don't
00:05:17.990 like
00:05:18.020 a

00:05:18.110 big
00:05:18.410 chunk
00:05:18.949 of
00:05:19.130 carrot
00:05:20.410 so
00:05:21.410 this
00:05:21.620 works
00:05:21.860 well

00:05:22.009 if
00:05:22.370 you
00:05:22.550 don't
00:05:22.940 have
00:05:23.270 this
00:05:23.570 let
00:05:23.900 me
00:05:23.930 do
00:05:24.080 a

00:05:24.110 couple
00:05:24.410 more
00:05:24.530 swipes
00:05:27.160 it's
00:05:28.160 pretty
00:05:28.340 cool
00:05:28.550 how

00:05:28.699 that
00:05:28.880 works
00:05:29.060 you
00:05:29.750 just
00:05:29.810 go
00:05:30.080 around
00:05:30.199 rotate

00:05:30.680 your
00:05:30.830 carrot
00:05:36.490 now
00:05:37.490 if
00:05:37.610 you
00:05:37.699 don't
00:05:37.880 have
00:05:38.180 this

00:05:38.449 I'll
00:05:38.840 show
00:05:38.900 you
00:05:39.289 what
00:05:39.440 you
00:05:39.530 can

00:05:44.720 it's
00:05:45.349 you
00:05:45.650 know

00:05:45.740 because
00:05:46.039 this
00:05:46.190 thing
00:05:46.430 rolls
00:05:46.669 around
00:05:46.789 a
00:05:47.000 lot

00:05:47.150 it's

00:05:50.389 now

00:05:50.539 your
00:05:50.750 carrot
00:05:51.169 will
00:05:51.259 just
00:05:51.440 sit
00:05:51.620 solid
00:05:52.009 and
00:05:52.160 it's

00:05:52.280 not
00:05:52.430 going
00:05:52.550 to
00:05:52.639 roll
00:05:52.789 around
00:05:52.940 on

00:05:57.740 real
00:05:58.099 fine
00:05:58.449 chopping

00:06:18.199 your
00:06:18.560 rice
00:06:18.979 paper
00:06:19.789 so
00:06:20.710 you
00:06:21.710 might

00:06:22.190 want
00:06:22.400 to
00:06:22.430 cut

00:06:23.870 be

00:06:23.990 sure
00:06:26.289 and
00:06:27.289 then
00:06:27.409 I'm
00:06:27.500 going

00:06:32.539 pieces
00:06:33.349 if
00:06:33.680 you
00:06:33.800 don't
00:06:33.979 like
00:06:34.099 the
00:06:34.220 seeds
00:06:34.460 you

00:06:36.289 so
00:06:36.440 I
00:06:36.620 leave
00:06:36.830 them
00:06:36.949 in

00:06:47.180 that
00:06:47.449 it
00:06:47.599 just
00:06:47.630 depends
00:06:48.110 on
00:06:48.169 how
00:06:48.320 you
00:06:48.380 want

00:08:00.689 now

00:08:01.589 right
00:08:01.769 now
00:08:01.949 it's
00:08:02.219 still
00:08:02.839 you
00:08:03.839 know
00:08:03.899 you

00:08:23.429 I
00:08:23.490 don't
00:08:23.669 know

00:08:23.819 if
00:08:23.879 you
00:08:23.969 can
00:08:24.119 see
00:08:24.329 it
00:08:24.449 but
00:08:24.689 it's
00:08:25.559 pretty

00:08:26.099 transparent
00:08:26.849 here
00:08:26.969 on
00:08:27.089 the
00:08:27.209 board
00:08:27.559 now
00:08:28.559 the

00:08:28.649 first
00:08:28.949 thing
00:08:29.099 you
00:08:29.249 put
00:08:29.399 down
00:08:29.610 is
00:08:29.819 what's
00:08:29.999 going

00:08:30.119 to
00:08:30.179 be
00:08:30.329 the
00:08:30.419 most
00:08:30.599 noticeable
00:08:30.959 so
00:08:31.709 I
00:08:32.069 want
00:08:32.490 to

00:08:32.579 put
00:08:32.789 down
00:08:33.000 some
00:08:33.389 shrimp
00:08:33.630 first
00:08:34.050 so
00:08:34.289 that
00:08:34.439 that

00:08:34.620 will
00:08:34.800 be
00:08:34.949 seen
00:08:36.019 okay

00:08:39.149 and
00:08:39.860 then
