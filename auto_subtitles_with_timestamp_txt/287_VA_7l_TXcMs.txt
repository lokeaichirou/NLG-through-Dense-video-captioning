00:03:40.950 the
00:03:41.550 mixture
00:03:41.700 will
00:03:42.090 be
00:03:42.590 grinded
00:03:43.590 evenly
00:03:44.250 and

00:03:44.670 you
00:03:44.700 don't
00:03:45.000 find
00:03:45.270 any
00:03:45.600 lumps
00:03:46.050 or
00:03:46.760 the
00:03:47.760 grains

00:03:48.060 left
00:03:48.750 in
00:03:49.230 the
00:03:49.440 batter
00:03:49.650 and
00:03:50.450 I'm
00:03:51.450 gonna
00:03:51.660 just

00:03:52.410 add

00:03:53.160 little
00:03:53.340 bit
00:03:53.670 rice
00:03:54.480 on
00:03:54.690 the
00:03:54.810 doll

00:03:54.990 mixture
00:03:55.470 and
00:03:55.800 carry
00:03:56.490 on
00:03:56.700 with
00:03:56.850 the
00:03:56.910 blending

00:03:57.240 process
00:03:57.440 till
00:03:58.440 I

00:04:05.940 add
00:04:06.150 a
00:04:06.570 little
00:04:06.720 bit
00:04:06.990 of
00:04:07.080 water

00:04:09.440 and
00:04:10.440 start
00:04:11.160 the
00:04:11.550 blending
00:04:11.880 again
00:04:13.700 and
00:04:14.700 now

00:04:14.970 here
00:04:15.450 we
00:04:15.600 go
00:04:15.630 I'm
00:04:15.930 gonna
00:04:16.080 aren't
00:04:16.590 everything

00:04:20.490 I'm
00:04:21.490 done
00:04:21.760 making
00:04:22.030 the
00:04:22.240 batter
00:04:22.420 and
00:04:23.050 I
00:04:23.320 ended

00:04:23.890 up
00:04:24.010 using
00:04:24.250 about
00:04:24.820 1
00:04:25.810 cup
00:04:26.080 of
00:04:26.230 water
00:04:27.240 while

00:04:28.240 blending
00:04:28.750 this
00:04:28.930 and
00:04:29.310 the
00:04:30.310 texture
00:04:30.730 of
00:04:30.970 the

00:04:31.540 battery
00:04:31.930 should
00:04:31.960 look
00:04:32.320 like
00:04:32.530 this
00:04:32.770 it's
00:04:33.760 a

00:04:33.850 little
00:04:34.240 bit
00:04:34.390 on
00:04:35.200 coarse
00:04:35.800 side
00:04:36.100 not
00:04:36.580 very

00:04:36.880 smooth
00:04:37.300 so
00:04:38.050 now
00:04:38.230 this
00:04:38.650 goes
00:04:38.950 into
00:04:39.010 the
00:04:39.310 warm

00:04:39.640 oven
00:04:40.120 so
00:04:40.390 that
00:04:40.570 it
00:04:40.840 gets
00:04:41.080 fermented
00:04:41.200 well
00:04:41.890 I'm

00:04:42.160 gonna

00:04:46.150 about
00:04:46.600 180

00:04:47.500 Fahrenheit
00:04:47.830 or
00:04:48.430 approximately
00:04:49.180 200

00:04:49.600 Fahrenheit
00:04:50.080 should
00:04:50.260 be
00:04:50.380 fine
00:04:50.590 with
00:04:50.830 the

00:04:50.920 batter
00:04:51.960 and
00:04:52.960 I've
00:04:53.380 turned
00:04:53.590 it
00:04:53.800 off

00:05:20.140 180

00:05:21.070 Fahrenheit
00:05:21.400 are
00:05:22.210 about
00:05:23.200 200
00:05:23.800 Fahrenheit

00:05:24.280 should
00:05:24.460 be
00:05:24.550 fine
00:05:24.820 too
00:05:25.300 and
00:05:25.690 after
00:05:26.350 every
00:05:26.950 four

00:05:27.220 hours
00:05:27.490 or
00:05:28.000 five
00:05:28.060 hours
00:05:28.390 I'm
00:05:29.020 going
00:05:29.560 to
00:05:29.650 take

00:05:29.830 off
00:05:30.010 the
00:05:30.130 batter
00:05:30.370 from
00:05:30.700 the
00:05:30.850 oven
00:05:31.060 and
00:05:31.410 again

00:05:32.410 warm
00:05:32.860 the
00:05:33.070 oven
00:05:33.430 to
00:05:33.670 about
00:05:33.700 200
00:05:34.570 Fahrenheit

00:05:35.200 and
00:05:35.830 turn
00:05:36.550 it
00:05:36.670 off
00:05:36.820 and
00:05:37.560 just
00:05:38.560 pop
00:05:38.980 it
00:05:39.190 into
00:05:39.550 the

00:05:39.880 oven
00:05:39.910 and
00:05:40.480 I'll
00:05:41.380 be
00:05:41.620 carrying
00:05:42.040 on
00:05:42.250 for
00:05:42.880 every

00:05:43.180 four
00:05:43.870 to
00:05:44.110 five
00:05:44.560 hours
00:05:44.950 about
00:05:45.430 two
00:05:45.730 to
00:05:45.850 three

00:05:46.090 times
00:05:46.410 so
00:05:47.410 that
00:05:47.650 it
00:05:47.950 gets
00:05:48.190 fermented
00:05:48.490 well
00:05:49.120 so

00:05:49.870 now
00:05:50.050 we'll
00:05:50.440 be
00:05:50.620 back
00:05:50.890 after
00:05:51.640 about

00:05:52.300 approximately
00:05:53.290 10
00:05:53.500 to
00:05:53.650 12
00:05:53.950 hours
00:05:54.160 of

00:05:54.670 fermentation
00:05:56.340 so
00:05:57.340 that
00:05:57.550 the
00:05:57.760 dosa
00:05:58.000 batter

00:05:58.180 will
00:05:58.660 be
00:05:58.690 fermented
00:05:59.320 well
00:05:59.910 it's
00:06:00.910 been
00:06:01.120 about

00:06:01.300 12
00:06:01.630 hours
00:06:01.840 now
00:06:02.140 so
00:06:02.410 let's
00:06:02.590 check
00:06:02.890 on
00:06:03.070 the
00:06:03.220 dosa

00:06:03.520 batter
00:06:03.670 I
00:06:07.260 think
00:06:08.260 it
00:06:08.380 has
00:06:08.560 got
00:06:08.830 fermented
00:06:09.400 very

00:06:09.610 well
00:06:10.380 actually
00:06:11.380 I
00:06:11.680 can
00:06:11.890 see
00:06:12.070 a
00:06:12.100 lot
00:06:12.520 of
00:06:12.640 bubbles

00:06:13.090 over
00:06:13.870 here
00:06:14.230 this
00:06:15.100 says
00:06:15.340 that
00:06:15.610 it
00:06:16.360 has
00:06:16.570 very
00:06:17.110 bad

00:06:17.500 fermented
00:06:18.160 now
00:06:18.820 I'm
00:06:18.940 gonna
00:06:19.090 add
00:06:19.300 salt
00:06:19.990 to
00:06:20.140 this

00:06:20.320 this
00:06:20.710 is
00:06:20.770 according
00:06:21.040 to
00:06:21.250 your
00:06:21.370 taste
00:06:22.080 I'm

00:06:23.080 gonna
00:06:23.290 add
00:06:23.440 about
00:06:23.650 1
00:06:24.370 teaspoon
00:06:24.900 after
00:06:25.900 the

00:06:25.990 fermentation
00:06:26.170 process
00:06:26.530 it's
00:06:27.070 actually

00:06:27.700 thickened
00:06:28.419 up
00:06:28.570 so
00:06:28.840 now
00:06:28.990 I'm
00:06:29.020 gonna
00:06:29.260 add
00:06:29.440 about

00:06:29.650 1
00:06:30.490 by
00:06:30.669 4th
00:06:30.910 cup
00:06:31.120 of
00:06:31.240 water
00:06:31.570 to
00:06:31.810 this
00:06:31.960 to

00:06:32.490 it
00:06:32.639 into
00:06:33.060 the
00:06:33.150 right
00:06:33.330 consistency
00:06:34.169 but

00:06:34.440 totally
00:06:34.860 in
00:06:35.069 the
00:06:35.220 preparation
00:06:36.210 of
00:06:36.240 dosa

00:06:36.599 batter
00:06:36.720 I
00:06:37.199 approximately
00:06:37.889 used
00:06:38.069 about
00:06:38.310 one

00:06:38.580 and
00:06:38.669 a
00:06:38.729 half
00:06:38.759 cups
00:06:39.090 of
00:06:39.210 water
00:06:40.340 approximately

00:06:41.360 but
00:06:42.360 it
00:06:42.539 differs
00:06:42.720 so
00:06:43.590 be
00:06:43.770 careful
00:06:44.160 while

00:06:44.310 adding
00:06:44.789 the
00:06:44.880 water
00:06:45.060 and
00:06:46.020 the
00:06:46.380 consistency
00:06:46.830 of

00:06:46.949 the
00:06:47.069 batter
00:06:47.099 should
00:06:47.370 look
00:06:47.639 like
00:06:47.669 this

00:06:48.270 it's
00:06:49.020 not
00:06:49.949 thick
00:06:50.310 and
00:06:50.580 not
00:06:50.729 too
00:06:50.789 thin
00:06:51.770 and
00:06:52.770 it's

00:06:53.160 perfect
00:06:53.759 actually
00:06:54.449 I
00:06:56.660 can
00:06:57.660 see
00:06:57.810 a
00:06:57.840 lot
00:06:58.229 of

00:06:58.349 bubbles
00:06:58.740 and
00:06:59.039 this
00:06:59.550 is
00:06:59.699 how
00:06:59.910 the
00:07:00.630 batter

00:07:00.840 should
00:07:00.960 look
00:07:01.289 like
00:07:01.729 your
00:07:02.729 aha
00:07:03.000 got
00:07:03.240 a
00:07:03.270 pan
00:07:03.979 I'm

00:07:04.979 gonna
00:07:05.190 check
00:07:05.460 it
00:07:05.639 if
00:07:06.030 it's
00:07:06.270 hot
00:07:08.599 then
00:07:09.599 it's

00:07:09.840 ready
00:07:10.080 I
00:07:10.520 have
00:07:11.520 tested
00:07:11.970 by
00:07:12.330 adding
00:07:12.780 some
00:07:12.960 water

00:07:13.370 so
00:07:14.370 now
00:07:14.520 it's
00:07:14.880 ready
00:07:15.150 to
00:07:15.389 make
00:07:15.650 the
00:07:16.650 dosa
00:07:20.539 just

00:07:21.620 spread
00:07:22.620 the
00:07:22.770 batter
00:07:22.919 in
00:07:23.280 a
00:07:23.370 circular
00:07:23.610 motion

00:07:26.539 cook
