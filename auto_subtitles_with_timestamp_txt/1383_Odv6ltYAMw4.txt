00:00:21.900 all
00:00:22.260 I
00:00:22.289 did

00:00:22.619 this

00:00:23.400 the
00:00:23.550 green
00:00:23.789 garlic

00:00:24.539 from

00:00:24.660 my
00:00:24.840 CSA
00:00:25.380 so
00:00:26.039 it's
00:00:26.160 not
00:00:26.310 as
00:00:26.519 strong
00:00:27.060 at
00:00:27.420 least
00:00:27.570 I

00:00:27.689 don't
00:00:27.750 think
00:00:27.900 as
00:00:28.230 regular
00:00:28.680 garlic
00:00:28.920 all
00:00:29.640 I
00:00:29.760 did

00:00:29.939 is
00:00:30.060 wrapped
00:00:30.330 it
00:00:30.480 in
00:00:30.510 some
00:00:30.630 tinfoil
00:00:31.230 drew
00:00:31.710 it
00:00:31.800 in

00:00:31.920 the
00:00:31.980 oven
00:00:32.160 cooked
00:00:32.969 it
00:00:33.120 for
00:00:33.149 about
00:00:33.360 an
00:00:33.630 hour
00:00:33.780 and

00:00:34.520 then
00:00:35.520 this
00:00:35.910 doesn't
00:00:36.180 dish
00:00:36.660 as
00:00:36.899 well
00:00:37.079 as
00:00:38.329 some

00:00:39.329 of
00:00:39.420 the
00:00:39.450 other
00:00:39.660 but
00:00:39.989 what
00:00:40.140 you
00:00:40.230 can
00:00:40.440 do
00:00:40.649 with

00:00:41.399 roasted
00:00:41.820 garlic
00:00:41.940 is
00:00:42.239 you
00:00:42.329 just
00:00:42.540 squeeze
00:00:42.780 it

00:00:42.960 and
00:00:43.200 it
00:00:43.860 comes
00:00:44.070 out
00:00:44.370 as
00:00:45.239 a
00:00:45.930 paste

00:00:50.610 that
00:00:50.700 and
00:00:50.879 this
00:00:51.000 is
00:00:51.120 a
00:00:51.149 little
00:00:51.420 different

00:00:51.600 because
00:00:51.840 it's
00:00:52.110 not
00:00:53.510 mature
00:00:54.510 garlic
00:00:55.170 I
00:00:55.410 don't

00:00:55.710 think
00:00:55.860 it's
00:00:55.949 strong
00:00:56.430 so
00:00:57.239 I'm
