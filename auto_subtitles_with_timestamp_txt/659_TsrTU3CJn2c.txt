00:00:49.649 don't
00:00:49.980 worry

00:00:50.100 that's
00:00:50.640 going
00:00:50.820 to
00:00:50.879 evaporate
00:00:51.120 and
00:00:51.629 eventually

00:00:52.230 you'll

00:00:52.649 hearing
00:00:52.890 it
00:00:53.010 sizzle
00:00:53.460 and
00:00:53.699 it

00:00:53.879 will
00:00:54.000 start
00:00:54.239 to
00:00:54.329 brown
00:00:54.660 and
00:00:54.960 nicely
00:00:55.370 ideally

00:00:56.370 it

00:00:59.219 the
00:00:59.309 pan
00:00:59.550 alright
00:01:00.180 when
00:01:00.329 it
00:01:00.420 gets

00:01:00.600 to
00:01:00.750 that
00:01:00.870 point

00:01:01.829 took
00:01:02.070 me
00:01:02.190 about
00:01:02.399 10

00:01:02.699 minutes
00:01:02.910 or
00:01:03.149 so
00:01:03.300 I'm
00:01:03.600 gonna
00:01:03.750 add
00:01:03.870 a
00:01:03.930 nice
00:01:04.110 big

00:01:04.290 spoon
00:01:04.619 of
00:01:04.739 flour
00:01:04.979 that's
00:01:05.700 going

00:01:06.270 beautiful
00:01:06.810 thick
00:01:07.049 gravy
00:01:07.320 that

00:01:08.010 this
00:01:08.189 together

00:01:08.670 we're

00:01:09.570 flour
00:01:09.960 for
00:01:10.229 just

00:01:10.409 about
00:01:10.500 three
00:01:10.740 or
00:01:10.920 four
00:01:11.100 minutes
00:01:11.430 and
00:01:11.610 while

00:01:11.880 we're
00:01:12.090 cooking
00:01:12.210 the
00:01:12.510 raw
00:01:12.689 edge
00:01:12.930 off
00:01:13.229 that

00:01:13.439 flour
00:01:13.740 let's
00:01:14.340 go
00:01:14.520 ahead
00:01:14.640 and
00:01:14.880 add
00:01:14.939 our

00:01:15.119 seasoning
00:01:15.630 we're
00:01:16.140 gonna
00:01:16.229 go
00:01:16.439 with
00:01:16.590 salt
00:01:16.890 and

00:01:17.040 pepper
00:01:17.100 some
00:01:18.030 fresh
00:01:18.090 rosemary
00:01:18.750 a
00:01:19.500 little
00:01:19.799 bit

00:01:20.189 of
00:01:20.280 paprika
00:01:20.580 a
00:01:21.150 little
00:01:21.570 touch
00:01:22.200 of
00:01:22.229 cinnamon

00:01:22.670 some
00:01:23.670 ketchup
00:01:24.020 which
00:01:25.020 I
00:01:25.170 hear
00:01:25.350 people
00:01:25.680 in

00:01:25.799 Europe
00:01:26.100 love
00:01:26.580 and
00:01:26.970 some
00:01:27.630 fresh
00:01:27.930 minced
00:01:28.470 garlic

00:01:28.680 we're
00:01:29.610 going
00:01:29.729 to
00:01:29.790 stir
00:01:30.000 that
00:01:30.030 in
00:01:30.420 and
00:01:30.689 I
00:01:31.259 know

00:01:31.320 some
00:01:31.680 that's
00:01:31.860 not
00:01:32.070 classic
00:01:32.790 classic

00:01:33.299 shepherd's
00:01:33.659 pie
00:01:33.869 but
00:01:34.530 you
00:01:34.619 know
00:01:34.740 what
00:01:34.860 the

00:01:35.009 Irish
00:01:35.280 are
00:01:35.430 very
00:01:35.729 experimental
00:01:36.180 people
00:01:36.570 and
00:01:36.810 I

00:01:37.229 think
00:01:37.439 they
00:01:37.500 would
00:01:37.619 approve
00:01:37.890 so
00:01:38.610 by
00:01:38.729 the
00:01:38.790 time

00:01:39.000 we
00:01:39.060 added
00:01:39.479 our
00:01:39.570 seasoning
00:01:40.079 and
00:01:40.290 stirred
00:01:40.590 it
00:01:40.710 in

00:01:40.920 the
00:01:41.250 flour
00:01:41.490 has
00:01:41.670 been
00:01:41.850 cooking
00:01:42.090 long
00:01:42.390 enough

00:01:42.689 and
00:01:43.110 we're
00:01:43.290 going
00:01:43.409 to
00:01:43.470 add
00:01:43.649 our
00:01:43.680 liquid
00:01:44.040 I'm

00:01:44.729 adding
00:01:45.149 water
00:01:45.329 now
00:01:45.869 you
00:01:45.930 can
00:01:46.170 add
00:01:46.290 chicken

00:01:46.530 broth
00:01:46.829 you
00:01:47.189 can
00:01:47.490 add
00:01:47.610 beef
00:01:47.880 broth
00:01:48.180 but
00:01:48.659 lamb
00:01:48.869 is

00:01:49.079 a
00:01:49.200 pretty
00:01:49.560 strongly
00:01:50.399 flavored
00:01:50.909 meat
00:01:51.119 so
00:01:51.540 it

00:01:51.600 really
00:01:51.840 doesn't
00:01:52.170 add
00:01:52.500 a
00:01:52.530 whole
00:01:52.860 heck
00:01:53.100 of
00:01:53.130 a
00:01:53.310 lot

00:01:53.340 all
00:01:54.149 right
00:01:54.360 we're
00:01:54.600 going
00:01:54.720 to
00:01:54.750 give
00:01:54.899 it
00:01:55.020 a
00:01:55.079 stir

00:01:55.320 it's
00:01:55.590 going
00:01:55.740 to
00:01:55.799 thicken
00:01:56.040 up
00:01:56.219 very
00:01:56.549 quickly

00:01:56.850 because
00:01:57.750 we
00:01:57.869 used
00:01:58.020 a
00:01:58.110 good
00:01:58.259 amount
00:01:58.409 of
00:01:58.560 flour

00:01:58.770 and
00:01:59.100 we're
00:01:59.460 just
00:01:59.579 going
00:01:59.759 to
00:01:59.820 cook
00:02:00.000 this
00:02:00.149 for

00:02:00.360 about
00:02:00.479 five
00:02:00.869 or
00:02:01.020 six
00:02:01.170 minutes
00:02:01.409 until
00:02:01.770 it

00:02:02.219 really
00:02:02.640 thickens
00:02:03.090 up
00:02:03.210 nice
00:02:03.479 I
00:02:03.810 mean
00:02:04.049 really

00:02:04.320 thick
00:02:04.770 it
00:02:05.100 should
00:02:05.280 look
00:02:05.369 something
00:02:05.610 like
00:02:05.759 that

00:02:06.119 at
00:02:06.689 that
00:02:06.899 point
00:02:07.140 you
00:02:07.229 can
00:02:07.380 turn
00:02:07.530 off
00:02:07.680 the
00:02:07.829 heat

00:02:07.860 and
00:02:08.280 it's
00:02:08.610 time
00:02:08.819 to
00:02:08.849 add
00:02:09.090 the
00:02:09.119 vegetables

00:02:09.750 which
00:02:10.170 are
00:02:10.410 peas
00:02:10.979 and
00:02:11.190 carrots
00:02:11.520 now
00:02:12.090 since

00:02:12.330 we're
00:02:12.510 using
00:02:12.540 frozen
00:02:13.110 peas

00:02:13.900 I'm
00:02:14.080 going
00:02:14.260 to
00:02:14.319 be
00:02:14.409 nice
00:02:14.620 and
00:02:14.650 lets
00:02:15.069 you
00:02:15.190 use

00:02:15.400 frozen
00:02:15.970 carrots
00:02:16.510 they
00:02:16.900 come
00:02:17.170 with
00:02:17.440 the
00:02:17.950 frozen

00:02:18.190 peas
00:02:18.489 in
00:02:18.730 the
00:02:18.790 same
00:02:18.970 bag
00:02:19.150 as
00:02:19.690 soon
00:02:19.750 as
00:02:20.019 the

00:02:20.140 vegetables
00:02:20.260 are
00:02:20.680 stirred
00:02:20.950 in
00:02:21.159 we're
00:02:21.370 going
00:02:21.489 to

00:02:21.549 transfer
00:02:22.000 this
00:02:22.120 into
00:02:22.390 your
00:02:22.629 casserole
00:02:23.200 dish

00:02:23.500 any
00:02:24.280 kind
00:02:24.489 of
00:02:24.610 large
00:02:24.879 baking
00:02:25.450 dish
00:02:25.569 will
00:02:25.780 work

00:02:25.959 I
00:02:26.230 believe
00:02:26.620 this
00:02:26.769 is
00:02:26.830 nine
00:02:27.129 by
00:02:27.159 thirteen

00:02:27.790 you're
