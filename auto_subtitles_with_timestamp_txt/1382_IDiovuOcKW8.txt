00:00:36.809 have
00:00:36.989 on
00:00:37.050 hand

00:00:37.710 I
00:00:37.739 do
00:00:38.280 sometimes
00:00:38.820 cook
00:00:39.450 the
00:00:39.660 beans
00:00:39.840 from

00:00:40.410 scratch
00:00:40.829 as
00:00:41.160 well
00:00:41.219 but
00:00:41.910 just
00:00:42.180 for
00:00:42.690 a
00:00:42.719 quick

00:00:42.960 easy
00:00:43.200 homeless
00:00:43.739 recipe
00:00:44.190 I
00:00:44.219 like
00:00:44.520 to
00:00:44.730 use
00:00:44.879 the

00:00:45.149 tinned
00:00:45.480 and
00:00:45.840 I
00:00:46.559 also
00:00:46.739 use
00:00:47.100 some
00:00:47.129 of
00:00:47.399 the
00:00:47.610 liquid

00:00:47.969 from
00:00:48.210 the
00:00:48.600 tin
00:00:48.809 so
00:00:49.710 these
00:00:49.890 are
00:00:50.250 organic
00:00:50.640 and

00:00:51.230 they

00:00:52.699 in
00:00:53.699 water
00:00:54.030 and
00:00:54.510 some
00:00:54.809 salt
00:00:55.110 so
00:00:55.500 I

00:00:55.559 won't
00:00:55.710 be
00:00:55.860 adding
00:00:56.010 too
00:00:56.280 much
00:00:56.460 extra
00:00:56.850 salt

00:00:57.239 sometimes
00:00:57.809 I
00:00:57.899 don't
00:00:57.960 add
00:00:58.230 any
00:00:58.440 extra
00:00:58.859 salt
00:00:59.100 at

00:00:59.309 all
00:00:59.399 just
00:00:59.730 depending
00:01:00.300 on
00:01:00.530 who
00:01:01.530 I'm
00:01:01.680 cooking

00:01:02.039 for
00:01:02.250 on
00:01:02.399 the
00:01:02.520 day
00:01:02.730 and
00:01:03.120 what
00:01:03.989 the
00:01:04.110 purpose
00:01:04.320 is

00:01:04.589 for
00:01:04.949 the
00:01:05.189 homeless

00:01:05.670 so
00:01:05.850 I'll
00:01:06.750 start
00:01:07.650 by
00:01:07.770 just
00:01:08.340 drain
00:01:08.670 leads
00:01:09.470 very

00:01:10.470 quickly
00:01:11.119 so
00:01:12.170 just
00:01:13.170 get
00:01:13.380 the
00:01:13.530 juice
00:01:13.799 out
00:01:14.070 of
00:01:14.100 it

00:01:15.080 chickpeas
00:01:17.299 just
00:01:18.299 roughly
00:01:18.689 drain
00:01:19.110 them
00:01:21.920 there

00:01:22.920 will
00:01:23.040 be
00:01:23.070 some
00:01:23.990 chickpeas
00:01:24.990 leftover
00:01:25.740 I'm

00:01:26.310 using
00:01:26.549 a
00:01:26.820 food
00:01:27.270 processor
00:01:27.299 today
00:01:28.259 it
00:01:28.560 just

00:01:28.619 takes
00:01:29.220 less
00:01:29.689 liquid
00:01:30.689 to
00:01:30.869 actually
00:01:31.140 make
00:01:31.380 them

00:01:31.619 but
00:01:31.829 I
00:01:32.009 do
00:01:32.070 quite
00:01:32.490 often
00:01:32.670 make
00:01:33.000 it
00:01:33.150 in
00:01:33.270 the

00:01:33.390 blender
00:01:33.630 as
00:01:33.960 well
00:01:33.990 you'll
00:01:34.770 just
00:01:34.950 need
00:01:35.100 to
00:01:35.220 add

00:01:35.369 more
00:01:35.400 liquid
00:01:35.670 till
00:01:36.240 you
00:01:36.299 get
00:01:36.479 the
00:01:36.630 right

00:01:36.780 consistency
00:01:38.750 even
00:01:39.750 though
00:01:40.049 the
00:01:40.409 tin
00:01:40.710 of
00:01:40.979 peas

00:01:43.070 so
00:01:44.070 next
00:01:44.310 I'm
00:01:44.579 going
00:01:44.610 to
00:01:44.880 do
00:01:45.000 the
00:01:45.149 same
00:01:45.479 thing

00:01:45.840 as
00:01:45.960 I
00:01:46.079 just
00:01:46.259 did
00:01:46.439 with
00:01:46.530 the
00:01:46.680 chickpeas
00:01:47.130 but

00:01:47.460 with
00:01:47.670 the
00:01:48.020 cannellini
00:01:49.020 beans
00:01:51.799 again
00:01:52.850 roughly

00:01:53.850 draining
00:01:54.570 them

00:01:58.049 while
00:01:59.049 I
00:01:59.080 remember
00:01:59.470 I'm
00:01:59.799 also
00:02:00.040 going
00:02:00.400 to
00:02:00.549 take

00:02:00.790 out
00:02:01.030 just
00:02:01.240 a
00:02:01.450 few
00:02:01.720 of
00:02:02.080 these
00:02:02.229 chickpeas
00:02:02.590 for

00:02:03.070 decorating
00:02:03.729 the
00:02:03.759 UM
00:02:04.060 almost
00:02:04.840 at
00:02:05.020 the
00:02:05.080 end
00:02:05.290 when

00:02:05.500 I
00:02:05.530 put
00:02:05.799 them
00:02:05.950 into
00:02:06.159 a
00:02:06.310 bowl
00:02:07.349 too
00:02:08.349 also
00:02:08.619 I'll

00:02:08.950 just
00:02:09.160 leave
00:02:09.369 those
00:02:09.610 there
00:02:09.640 in
00:02:10.090 a
00:02:10.179 little
00:02:10.450 on
00:02:11.140 a

00:02:11.200 little
00:02:11.440 plate
00:02:11.739 for
00:02:12.069 later
00:02:12.280 and
00:02:14.880 I'll
00:02:15.880 add
00:02:16.750 in

00:02:17.650 the
00:02:17.860 cannellini
00:02:18.370 beans
00:02:21.870 so
00:02:22.870 each
00:02:23.170 of
00:02:23.200 these

00:02:23.590 tins
00:02:24.130 has
00:02:24.459 four
00:02:24.790 hundred
00:02:25.090 and
00:02:25.180 twenty-five

00:02:25.780 grams
00:02:27.330 so
00:02:28.330 if
00:02:28.930 you
00:02:29.080 if
00:02:29.620 you're

00:02:32.890 two
00:02:33.100 cups
00:02:33.489 and
00:02:33.819 then
00:02:34.420 you
00:02:34.540 can
00:02:34.660 just

00:02:34.840 gauge
00:02:35.050 the
00:02:35.350 moisture
00:02:35.769 level
00:02:36.069 and
00:02:36.190 add
00:02:36.310 more

00:02:36.519 moisture
00:02:36.730 to
00:02:37.060 the
00:02:37.239 mixture
00:02:37.600 as
00:02:37.780 you
00:02:38.019 need
00:02:38.230 it

00:04:12.659 and
00:04:13.230 I
00:04:13.739 am
00:04:13.890 going

00:04:14.129 to
00:04:14.250 add
00:04:14.340 a
00:04:14.370 little
00:04:14.670 bit
00:04:14.790 of
00:04:14.970 Celtic
00:04:15.390 sea
00:04:15.599 salt

00:04:15.629 today
00:04:16.229 and
00:04:16.500 some
00:04:16.889 white
00:04:17.100 pepper
00:04:17.370 I
00:04:17.760 just
00:04:18.419 like

00:04:18.600 the
00:04:18.810 way
00:04:18.840 the
00:04:19.260 white
00:04:19.500 pepper
00:04:19.769 brings
00:04:20.100 out
00:04:20.250 the

00:04:20.370 flavors
00:04:20.820 so
00:04:21.750 I've
00:04:22.079 got
00:04:22.260 about
00:04:22.760 1
00:04:23.760 teaspoon
00:04:24.270 of

00:04:24.389 Celtic
00:04:24.780 sea
00:04:25.020 salt
00:04:25.050 and
00:04:25.620 about
00:04:26.130 quarter
00:04:26.669 of
00:04:26.760 a

00:04:26.850 teaspoon
00:04:27.030 of
00:04:27.630 the
00:04:27.930 white
00:04:28.320 pepper
00:04:29.000 now
00:04:30.000 as
00:04:30.630 I

00:04:30.810 mentioned
00:04:31.199 earlier
00:04:31.590 when
00:04:31.860 I'm
00:04:31.979 making
00:04:32.220 hummus

00:04:32.729 depending
00:04:33.630 on
00:04:33.720 if
00:04:33.840 I'm
00:04:33.990 making
00:04:34.169 it
00:04:34.410 in
00:04:34.500 the

00:04:34.590 food
00:04:34.740 processor
00:04:34.800 or
00:04:35.460 in
00:04:35.850 my
00:04:35.970 blender
00:04:36.240 the

00:04:37.139 liquid
00:04:37.949 that's
00:04:38.100 used
00:04:38.580 will
00:04:38.970 vary
00:04:39.389 because
00:04:39.990 you

00:04:40.289 don't
00:04:40.500 need
00:04:40.740 as
00:04:40.889 much
00:04:41.070 liquid
00:04:41.430 when
00:04:41.850 using
00:04:42.210 a

00:04:42.270 food
00:04:42.510 processor
00:04:42.539 so
00:04:43.440 just
00:04:44.160 to
00:04:44.280 start
00:04:44.340 with
00:04:44.699 I'm

00:04:45.030 going
00:04:45.210 to
00:04:45.300 put
00:04:45.710 probably
00:04:46.710 about

00:04:47.880 well--that's
00:04:48.270 quarter
00:04:48.810 of
00:04:48.900 a
00:04:49.020 cup
00:04:49.289 and
00:04:50.240 a

00:04:51.860 little
00:04:52.860 bit
00:04:52.979 more
00:04:54.590 that's
00:04:55.590 about
00:04:55.860 half
00:04:56.160 a
00:04:56.370 cup

00:04:56.580 there
00:04:56.940 to
00:04:57.210 start
00:04:57.510 with

00:04:58.010 and
00:04:59.010 I'll
00:04:59.400 just
00:05:00.139 start
00:05:01.139 that
00:05:01.350 blending

00:05:01.770 process
00:05:02.220 and
00:05:02.430 just
00:05:02.580 see
00:05:02.880 what
00:05:03.120 texture
00:05:03.600 will

00:05:03.810 be
00:05:03.840 like
00:05:04.229 and
00:05:04.729 if
00:05:05.729 I
00:05:05.910 need
00:05:06.090 to
00:05:06.210 adjust
00:05:06.330 it
00:05:06.780 I'll

00:05:06.900 do
00:05:07.110 so
00:05:07.320 at
00:05:07.470 that
00:05:07.620 time
00:05:16.639 so
00:05:17.639 that's
00:05:17.820 been

00:05:18.060 processing
00:05:18.720 for
00:05:18.930 about
00:05:19.139 half
00:05:19.440 a
00:05:19.620 minute
00:05:19.650 and

00:05:20.270 that
00:05:21.270 is
00:05:21.979 quite
00:05:22.979 a
00:05:23.250 run
00:05:23.599 consistency
00:05:24.599 I

00:05:24.630 probably
00:05:25.020 could
00:05:25.380 have
00:05:25.410 even
00:05:25.740 used
00:05:25.860 a
00:05:26.039 little

00:05:26.250 bit
00:05:26.310 less
00:05:26.870 liquid
00:05:27.870 I'm
00:05:27.990 just
00:05:28.200 so
00:05:28.380 used
00:05:28.410 to

00:05:28.740 making
00:05:29.010 it
00:05:29.250 in
00:05:29.340 my
00:05:29.460 blender
00:05:29.669 instead
00:05:30.060 of
00:05:30.419 here

00:05:30.690 that
00:05:30.990 it's
00:05:31.169 ended
00:05:32.099 up
00:05:32.220 a
00:05:32.340 bit
00:05:32.490 more
00:05:32.610 runny
00:05:32.820 so

00:05:33.090 maybe
00:05:33.630 start
00:05:33.990 with
00:05:34.050 quarter
00:05:34.470 of
00:05:34.680 a
00:05:34.770 cup
00:05:34.950 of
00:05:35.760 the

00:05:36.030 mixture
00:05:36.470 give
00:05:37.470 it
00:05:37.590 a
00:05:37.650 taste
