00:01:34.500 kimchi

00:01:36.640 next
00:01:37.450 step
00:01:37.630 what
00:01:37.900 we're

00:01:51.400 like
00:01:51.670 pine
00:01:52.000 nuts
00:01:52.300 you

00:01:56.290 more
00:01:56.590 pine
00:01:57.220 nut
00:01:57.460 flavor

00:01:57.910 you'll
00:01:58.240 get
00:01:58.510 out
00:01:58.690 of
00:01:58.810 the
00:01:58.900 kimchi
00:01:59.350 but
00:02:00.250 you
00:02:00.340 can

00:02:00.490 always
00:02:00.610 skip
00:02:00.910 that
00:02:01.120 so
00:02:01.420 here
00:02:01.750 we
00:02:01.840 go
00:02:01.990 we're

00:02:02.170 going
00:02:02.350 to
00:02:02.560 blend
00:02:02.800 everything
00:02:03.010 together
00:02:11.610 by

00:02:12.610 the
00:02:12.670 way
00:02:12.880 if
00:02:13.150 you
00:02:13.660 have
00:02:13.840 Windex
00:02:14.560 at
00:02:14.860 home

00:02:15.540 instead
00:02:16.540 of
00:02:16.630 using
00:02:16.840 Windex
00:02:17.320 you
00:02:17.590 can
00:02:17.739 make

00:02:17.890 your
00:02:18.040 own
00:02:18.190 cleaner
00:02:18.940 with

00:02:19.690 and
00:02:19.810 water

00:02:20.020 quarter
00:02:20.680 vinegar
00:02:21.130 and
00:02:21.370 three-quarters
00:02:21.970 water

00:02:22.239 and
00:02:22.570 it
00:02:23.050 works
00:02:23.260 just
00:02:23.500 like
00:02:23.650 Windex
00:02:24.100 but
00:02:24.430 it's

00:02:24.640 better
00:02:25.000 for
00:02:25.239 your
00:02:25.330 health
00:02:25.540 and
00:02:25.810 the

00:02:26.020 environment
00:02:27.090 so
00:02:28.090 now
00:02:28.300 what
00:02:28.480 we're
00:02:28.630 going

00:02:31.590 blended
00:02:32.590 stuff
00:02:32.950 into
00:02:33.550 a
00:02:33.580 cheesecloth

00:02:34.270 now
00:02:35.050 what
00:02:35.290 we
00:02:35.440 need
00:02:35.739 is
00:02:36.010 just
00:02:36.070 the
00:02:36.940 liquid
00:02:37.360 so
