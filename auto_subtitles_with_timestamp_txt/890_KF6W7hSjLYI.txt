00:03:39.709 you
00:03:39.890 guys
00:03:40.100 that
00:03:40.580 I

00:03:41.990 virgin
00:03:42.170 olive
00:03:42.350 oil
00:03:42.800 and

00:03:43.180 I'm
00:03:44.180 going

00:03:46.490 put
00:03:46.760 it
00:03:46.850 in
00:03:46.970 the

00:03:50.000 and
00:03:50.330 I

00:03:51.260 usually

00:03:52.610 use
00:03:52.910 this
00:03:53.150 rather
00:03:53.720 than

00:03:53.959 like
00:03:54.170 use
00:03:54.380 water
00:03:54.709 because
00:03:54.800 it
00:03:55.010 cooks
00:03:55.190 the

00:03:55.250 chicken
00:03:55.310 fast
00:03:55.760 and

00:03:59.360 so
00:03:59.510 it
00:04:00.380 usually
00:04:00.530 once

00:04:01.459 it
00:04:01.790 starts
00:04:02.090 cooking
00:04:02.240 down
00:04:02.480 it
00:04:02.840 has
00:04:03.440 his
00:04:03.620 own

00:04:03.770 water
00:04:04.040 and
00:04:04.280 you
00:04:05.030 know
00:04:05.180 it
00:04:05.570 it
00:04:05.930 becomes
00:04:06.260 perfect
