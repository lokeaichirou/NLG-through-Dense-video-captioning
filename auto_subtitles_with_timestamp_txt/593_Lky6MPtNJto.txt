00:02:22.100 not
00:02:22.190 supposed

00:02:22.490 to
00:02:22.550 don't
00:02:23.150 worry
00:02:23.270 we're
00:02:23.690 just
00:02:23.720 taking
00:02:24.140 the
00:02:24.200 raw

00:02:24.380 edge
00:02:24.560 off
00:02:24.830 the
00:02:24.860 flour
00:02:25.190 at
00:02:25.730 that
00:02:26.150 point
00:02:26.450 you're

00:02:26.600 going
00:02:26.690 to
00:02:26.750 pour
00:02:27.020 in
00:02:27.230 your
00:02:27.440 cold
00:02:28.040 beef
00:02:29.000 broth

00:02:29.750 all
00:02:30.140 right
00:02:30.290 maybe
00:02:30.470 half
00:02:30.770 a
00:02:30.890 cup
00:02:31.100 at
00:02:31.190 a
00:02:31.250 time

00:02:31.280 just
00:02:31.730 pour
00:02:32.000 it
00:02:32.120 in
00:02:32.180 whisk
00:02:32.450 pour
00:02:32.870 it
00:02:32.960 in
00:02:33.080 whisk

00:02:33.320 and
00:02:33.560 because
00:02:34.250 the
00:02:34.490 stock
00:02:34.820 the
00:02:35.240 broth
00:02:35.480 is
00:02:35.720 cold

00:02:36.050 and
00:02:36.410 the
00:02:36.770 roux
00:02:37.010 is
00:02:37.190 hot
00:02:37.430 there's
00:02:38.270 no
00:02:38.420 lumps
00:02:38.660 so

00:02:39.410 stir
00:02:39.620 that
00:02:39.800 in
00:02:40.070 alright
00:02:40.820 we're
00:02:41.090 going
00:02:41.210 to
00:02:41.270 turn

00:02:41.450 the
00:02:41.570 heat
00:02:41.690 up
00:02:41.750 to
00:02:41.900 high

00:02:43.550 a

00:02:43.580 simmer
00:02:43.970 and
00:02:44.420 of
00:02:44.870 course
00:02:45.110 because
00:02:45.260 it's
00:02:45.500 a
00:02:45.590 roux

00:02:45.830 as
00:02:46.100 soon
00:02:46.250 as
00:02:46.370 it
00:02:46.490 comes
00:02:46.670 to
00:02:46.730 a
00:02:46.820 simmer
00:02:47.120 it
00:02:47.630 will

00:02:47.810 thicken
00:02:48.050 up
00:02:48.290 we're
00:02:49.100 going
00:02:49.220 to
00:02:49.280 season
00:02:49.550 that

00:02:49.700 with
00:02:49.850 salt
00:02:50.300 and
00:02:50.540 freshly
00:02:50.840 ground
00:02:51.110 black

00:02:51.560 pepper
00:02:51.760 so
00:02:52.760 that's
00:02:52.910 going
00:02:53.000 to
00:02:53.060 come
00:02:53.210 up
00:02:53.360 to
00:02:53.510 a

00:02:53.540 simmer
00:02:53.920 it's
00:02:54.920 going
00:02:55.130 to
00:02:55.190 thicken
00:02:55.430 up
00:02:55.670 and
00:02:55.940 at

00:02:56.690 that
00:02:56.870 point
00:02:57.110 we're
00:02:57.290 going
00:02:57.380 to
00:02:57.440 turn
00:02:57.530 off
00:02:57.770 the

00:02:58.100 heat
00:02:58.340 and
00:02:58.580 stir
00:02:59.120 in
00:02:59.270 our
00:02:59.810 heavy
00:03:00.080 cream
00:03:00.580 okay

00:03:01.580 and
00:03:01.820 that's
00:03:02.030 basically
00:03:02.420 it
00:03:02.540 so
00:03:03.020 now
00:03:03.140 we're

00:03:03.320 exactly
00:03:03.860 at
00:03:03.950 the
00:03:04.040 stage
00:03:04.280 you
00:03:04.490 saw
00:03:04.700 at
00:03:04.790 the

00:03:04.880 beginning
00:03:05.000 of
00:03:05.450 the
00:03:05.570 video
00:03:05.720 when
00:03:06.560 we
00:03:06.590 slid
00:03:07.070 our

00:03:07.400 already
00:03:08.150 formed
00:03:08.870 meatloaf
00:03:09.590 into
00:03:10.400 the
00:03:10.850 skillet

00:03:11.150 so
00:03:11.750 one
00:03:11.930 tip
00:03:12.140 make
00:03:12.350 sure
00:03:12.380 you
00:03:12.650 make
00:03:12.830 this
00:03:13.040 sauce

00:03:13.280 in
00:03:13.580 something
00:03:14.090 that
00:03:14.120 can
00:03:14.390 go
00:03:14.540 into
00:03:14.780 the
00:03:15.020 oven

00:03:15.200 because
00:03:15.920 that's
00:03:16.100 how
00:03:16.250 we're
00:03:16.370 going
00:03:16.490 to
00:03:16.550 cook

00:03:16.700 this
00:03:16.940 now
00:03:17.800 the
00:03:18.800 next
00:03:19.040 time
00:03:19.160 I
00:03:19.190 make
00:03:19.459 this
00:03:19.670 I'm

00:03:19.910 going
00:03:20.030 to
00:03:20.090 put
00:03:20.150 it
00:03:20.360 in
00:03:20.450 the
00:03:20.540 oven
00:03:20.660 like
00:03:20.959 this

00:03:21.130 Brown
00:03:22.130 the
00:03:22.400 top
00:03:22.640 and
00:03:23.000 then
00:03:23.270 baste
00:03:23.600 it
00:03:23.810 with

00:03:23.840 this
00:03:24.020 mushroom
00:03:24.440 sauce
00:03:24.700 here
00:03:25.700 I
00:03:25.850 was
00:03:26.330 so
00:03:26.570 drawn

00:03:27.110 to
00:03:27.140 that
00:03:27.530 sauce
00:03:27.890 it
00:03:28.280 just
00:03:28.520 kept
00:03:29.030 telling
00:03:29.450 me

00:03:29.600 please
00:03:30.350 spoon
00:03:31.010 me
00:03:31.280 over
00:03:31.580 that
00:03:31.730 meatloaf

00:03:32.300 I
00:03:32.600 couldn't
00:03:33.230 resist
00:03:33.709 alright
00:03:34.010 sometimes
00:03:34.400 the

00:03:34.550 urge
00:03:34.730 is
00:03:35.090 just
00:03:35.570 too
00:03:36.170 strong
00:03:36.230 and
00:03:37.010 I
00:03:37.220 gave
00:03:37.489 in

00:03:37.730 and
00:03:37.940 I
00:03:38.239 spoon
00:03:38.510 that
00:03:38.660 sauce
00:03:38.840 over
00:03:39.170 the
00:03:39.260 meatloaf

00:03:39.560 and
00:03:39.680 I
00:03:39.770 put
00:03:39.980 it
00:03:40.040 in
00:03:40.130 the
00:03:40.190 oven
00:03:40.340 and
00:03:40.700 it
00:03:40.970 still

00:03:41.180 was
00:03:41.300 fine
00:03:41.540 but
00:03:42.110 I
00:03:42.170 think
00:03:42.410 I
00:03:42.500 will
00:03:42.650 Brown
00:03:42.890 that

00:03:43.070 first
00:03:43.310 next
00:03:43.580 time
00:03:43.610 alright
00:03:44.239 that
00:03:44.480 went
00:03:44.690 into
00:03:44.810 a

00:03:44.959 low
00:03:45.290 oven
00:03:45.760 325
00:03:46.760 degrees
00:03:47.570 for
00:03:48.200 an
00:03:48.320 hour
00:03:48.500 and
00:03:49.010 30

00:03:49.489 minutes
00:03:49.790 or
00:03:50.209 until
00:03:50.930 an
00:03:51.620 internal
00:03:52.070 temperature

00:03:52.340 of
00:03:52.540 155
00:03:53.540 and
00:03:53.959 at
00:03:54.410 that
00:03:54.620 point
00:03:54.920 it
00:03:55.190 was
00:03:55.489 done
00:03:55.760 and

00:03:56.180 that's
00:03:56.690 looking
00:03:56.959 very
00:03:57.260 rustic
00:03:57.830 you
00:03:58.070 could

00:03:58.340 slice
00:03:58.670 and
00:03:58.910 serve
00:03:59.060 just
00:03:59.510 like
00:03:59.660 that
00:03:59.930 but

00:04:00.650 because
00:04:01.010 that
00:04:01.160 me
00:04:01.370 did
00:04:01.790 cook
00:04:02.120 in
00:04:02.360 that
00:04:02.600 sauce

00:04:02.959 lots
00:04:03.590 of
00:04:03.769 stuff
00:04:04.040 came
00:04:04.310 out
00:04:04.519 from
00:04:04.700 that
00:04:04.910 meat

00:04:05.150 juice
00:04:05.930 fat
00:04:06.890 alright
00:04:07.640 the
00:04:07.760 proteins
00:04:08.239 kind
00:04:08.510 of

00:04:08.570 coagulated
00:04:09.110 underneath
00:04:09.680 so
00:04:10.280 you
00:04:10.370 do
00:04:10.700 have

00:04:10.730 some
00:04:11.000 stuff
00:04:11.420 going
00:04:11.720 on
00:04:11.810 in
00:04:12.050 that
00:04:12.080 sauce
00:04:12.500 so

00:04:13.070 this
00:04:13.220 is
00:04:13.340 something
00:04:13.670 you
00:04:13.790 definitely
00:04:14.030 need
00:04:14.480 to

00:04:14.510 skim
00:04:14.870 the
00:04:14.900 fat
00:04:15.200 off
00:04:15.380 the
00:04:15.560 top
00:04:15.800 I
00:04:16.130 actually
00:04:16.910 skim

00:04:17.180 the
00:04:17.330 fat
00:04:17.510 off
00:04:17.690 the
00:04:17.840 top
00:04:18.049 and
00:04:18.669 boiled
00:04:19.669 the
00:04:19.790 sauce

00:04:20.000 in
00:04:20.209 the
00:04:20.269 pan
00:04:20.510 for
00:04:20.900 about
00:04:20.989 five
00:04:21.320 minutes
00:04:21.500 to

00:04:21.859 thicken
00:04:22.280 it
00:04:22.460 up
00:04:22.580 a
00:04:22.700 little
00:04:22.820 bit
00:04:23.060 but
00:04:23.390 anyway

00:04:23.690 I'm
00:04:23.960 sure
00:04:24.200 you
00:04:24.289 figure
00:04:24.500 out
00:04:24.530 the
00:04:24.740 rest

00:04:25.220 slice
00:04:25.580 meatloaf
00:04:26.360 pour
00:04:26.600 over

00:04:26.840 sauce
00:04:27.050 eat
00:04:27.650 with
00:04:27.860 mashed
00:04:28.040 potatoes
00:04:28.610 I
00:04:28.730 didn't

00:04:29.180 even
00:04:29.270 pretend
00:04:29.810 to
00:04:29.960 have
00:04:30.050 a
00:04:30.110 vegetable
00:04:30.620 side

00:04:30.770 dish
00:04:31.010 with
00:04:31.190 this
00:04:31.310 so
00:04:31.910 my
00:04:32.030 theory
00:04:32.300 here
00:04:32.660 was
00:04:32.900 the

00:04:33.440 meatloaf
00:04:33.949 will
00:04:34.250 flavor
00:04:34.639 the
00:04:34.850 gravy
00:04:35.300 as
00:04:35.630 it

00:04:35.990 roasts
00:04:36.320 as
00:04:36.650 it
00:04:36.979 braises
00:04:37.280 which
00:04:38.030 it
00:04:38.210 did
00:04:38.449 and

00:04:38.720 also
00:04:39.560 cooking
00:04:39.860 the
00:04:40.100 meatloaf
00:04:40.370 on
00:04:40.580 top
00:04:40.850 of
00:04:41.030 the

00:04:41.120 sauce
00:04:41.360 would
00:04:42.020 keep
00:04:42.290 the
00:04:42.440 oven
00:04:42.560 nice
00:04:42.919 and
00:04:43.130 moist

00:04:43.370 and
00:04:43.820 as
00:04:44.150 the
00:04:44.360 meatloaf
00:04:44.660 was
00:04:44.810 flavoring
00:04:45.290 the

00:04:45.410 sauce
00:04:45.650 hopefully
00:04:46.400 the
00:04:46.970 sauce
00:04:47.210 we
00:04:47.479 flavoring

00:04:47.990 the
00:04:48.080 meatloaf

00:04:48.680 alright
00:04:49.160 so
00:04:49.280 how
00:04:49.400 did
00:04:49.550 it
00:04:49.669 taste
00:04:49.910 really
00:04:50.330 good

00:04:50.630 the
00:04:50.960 sauce
00:04:51.169 excellent
00:04:52.010 the
00:04:52.430 texture
00:04:52.940 the

00:04:53.300 moisture
00:04:53.690 of
00:04:53.780 the
00:04:53.810 meatloaf
00:04:54.169 excellent
00:04:54.889 but

00:04:55.250 like
00:04:55.370 I
00:04:55.490 said
00:04:55.550 I
00:04:55.699 wasn't
00:04:55.910 thrilled
00:04:56.240 with
00:04:56.389 the

00:04:56.600 actual
00:04:56.840 meatloaf
00:04:57.199 itself
00:04:57.320 but
00:04:58.010 this

00:04:58.190 technique
00:04:58.520 I
00:04:58.699 think
00:04:58.729 was
00:04:59.030 worthwhile
00:04:59.240 and
00:04:59.780 I

00:05:00.169 do
00:05:00.229 think
00:05:00.860 the
00:05:01.040 meatloaf
00:05:01.370 definitely

00:05:02.270 definitely
00:05:03.050 improved
00:05:03.650 the
00:05:03.770 flavor
00:05:04.040 of
00:05:04.160 the

00:05:04.460 sauce
00:05:04.669 versus
00:05:05.660 just
00:05:05.870 making
00:05:06.139 it
00:05:06.229 separate
00:05:06.590 so

00:05:06.770 anyway
00:05:07.370 the
00:05:07.639 next
00:05:07.790 time
00:05:08.030 you're
00:05:08.210 playing
00:05:08.450 to

00:05:08.630 make
00:05:08.780 meatloaf
00:05:09.050 if
00:05:09.500 you're
00:05:09.740 a
00:05:09.770 fan
00:05:10.070 of

00:05:10.100 mushroom
00:05:10.669 sauces
00:05:11.150 maybe
00:05:11.780 give
00:05:12.169 this

00:05:12.350 technique
00:05:12.770 a
00:05:12.889 try

00:05:13.430 and
00:05:13.520 of
00:05:13.910 course
00:05:14.120 head
00:05:14.330 over
00:05:14.479 to
00:05:14.600 food
00:05:14.750 whooshes

00:05:15.050 calm
00:05:15.530 for
00:05:15.740 all
00:05:15.889 the
00:05:16.040 ingredient
00:05:16.610 amounts
00:05:17.000 as

00:05:17.090 well
