00:00:52.350 to
00:00:52.559 this
00:00:52.680 technique
00:00:53.070 would

00:00:53.280 be
00:00:53.399 making
00:00:53.670 sure
00:00:54.059 you

00:00:57.120 the
00:00:57.570 same

00:00:57.750 size
00:00:57.989 because
00:00:58.410 we're

00:00:58.859 cook
00:00:59.010 these

00:00:59.190 all
00:00:59.250 the
00:00:59.730 way
00:00:59.760 through
00:01:00.149 until
00:01:00.359 completely

00:01:01.079 tender
00:01:01.680 we
00:01:02.160 don't
00:01:02.340 want
00:01:02.520 small
00:01:03.000 pieces

00:01:03.329 falling
00:01:03.930 apart
00:01:04.229 and
00:01:04.470 the
00:01:05.040 bigger
00:01:05.189 pieces

00:01:05.460 stayin
00:01:05.850 crunchy
00:01:06.299 that
00:01:06.930 would
00:01:07.080 be
00:01:07.200 bad
00:01:07.439 we're

00:01:08.280 going
00:01:08.430 to
00:01:08.490 boil
00:01:08.729 those
00:01:09.000 in
00:01:09.240 salted
00:01:09.900 water

00:01:10.430 until
00:01:11.430 like
00:01:11.760 I
00:01:11.909 said
00:01:12.180 very
00:01:12.689 very
00:01:13.140 tender
00:01:13.470 it's

00:01:14.040 actually
00:01:14.460 better
00:01:14.670 to
00:01:14.760 go
00:01:15.000 a
00:01:15.030 little
00:01:15.420 tiny
00:01:16.409 bit

00:01:16.680 over
00:01:17.070 then
00:01:17.549 under
00:01:17.930 undercooked
00:01:18.930 potatoes

00:01:19.409 we'll
00:01:19.680 make
00:01:19.890 those
00:01:20.250 horrible
00:01:20.729 lumps
00:01:21.689 that

00:01:21.720 everybody
00:01:22.170 hates
00:01:22.409 so
00:01:22.830 just
00:01:23.159 make
00:01:23.340 sure

00:01:23.369 they're
00:01:23.790 totally
00:01:24.030 tender
00:01:24.600 so
00:01:25.229 while
00:01:25.439 those

00:01:25.590 are
00:01:25.650 cooking
00:01:25.979 I'm

00:01:32.790 see
00:01:33.630 how
00:01:33.750 nice

00:01:33.960 and
00:01:34.200 yellow
00:01:34.380 that
00:01:34.710 is
00:01:34.890 that's
00:01:35.340 really
00:01:35.880 good

00:01:36.060 butter
00:01:36.299 and
00:01:36.900 I
00:01:36.960 know
00:01:37.020 that
00:01:37.229 seems
00:01:37.470 like
00:01:37.560 a
00:01:37.680 lot

00:01:37.950 but
00:01:37.979 I
00:01:38.189 have
00:01:38.369 over
00:01:38.729 four
00:01:39.240 pounds
00:01:39.450 of
00:01:39.689 potatoes

00:01:40.229 some
00:01:40.950 restaurants

00:01:41.549 25%
00:01:42.590 butter

00:01:43.829 weight
00:01:44.070 of
00:01:44.310 potato

00:01:45.479 is
00:01:45.570 about
00:01:45.750 half

00:01:47.369 meal
00:01:47.729 I

00:01:47.970 want

00:01:48.360 little
00:01:48.570 decadence
00:01:49.079 it's
00:01:49.649 okay

00:01:52.470 I'm
00:01:52.530 going
00:01:52.619 to
00:01:52.710 cut
00:01:52.860 the
00:01:52.950 butter

00:01:53.130 up
00:01:53.280 in
00:01:53.399 pieces
00:01:53.729 just
00:01:53.880 leave
00:01:54.090 that
00:01:54.210 out
00:01:54.270 at
00:01:54.509 room

00:01:54.659 temperature
00:01:54.689 and
00:01:55.500 then
00:01:55.979 for
00:01:56.189 the
00:01:56.280 rest
00:01:56.430 I
00:01:56.670 have

00:01:56.909 our
00:01:57.090 mascarpone
00:01:57.869 cheese

00:01:58.290 not
00:01:58.829 a
00:01:58.860 ton
00:01:59.280 maybe
00:01:59.790 about
00:02:00.000 a
00:02:00.060 half
00:02:00.270 a
00:02:00.390 cup
00:02:00.619 one

00:02:01.619 egg
00:02:01.920 yolk
00:02:02.219 and
00:02:02.460 just
00:02:02.880 regular
00:02:03.390 milk
00:02:03.930 so
00:02:04.680 I'm

00:02:04.740 going
00:02:04.890 to
00:02:04.920 mix
00:02:05.100 that
00:02:05.250 together
00:02:05.399 now
00:02:06.149 if
00:02:06.390 I
00:02:06.570 was

00:02:06.780 smart
00:02:07.140 I
00:02:07.409 would
00:02:07.619 have
00:02:07.710 left
00:02:07.829 my
00:02:07.950 cheese
00:02:08.190 out
00:02:08.369 of

00:02:08.399 room
00:02:08.610 temperature
00:02:08.910 because
00:02:09.479 this
00:02:09.810 was
00:02:09.959 really

00:02:10.200 hard
00:02:10.379 to
00:02:10.440 mix
00:02:10.709 but
00:02:11.310 I'm
00:02:11.430 nothing
00:02:11.760 if
00:02:11.879 not

00:02:11.940 persistent
00:02:12.270 so
00:02:12.930 after
00:02:13.140 a
00:02:13.170 couple
00:02:13.410 minutes

00:02:13.710 whisking
00:02:14.100 it
00:02:14.370 did
00:02:14.550 mix
00:02:15.090 in
00:02:15.240 there
00:02:15.360 nicely
00:02:15.600 so

00:02:16.170 you
00:02:16.230 may
00:02:16.560 want
00:02:16.740 to
00:02:16.800 just
00:02:16.980 leave
00:02:17.130 your

00:02:17.280 mascarpone
00:02:17.790 out
00:02:17.970 on
00:02:18.120 the
00:02:18.210 table
00:02:18.570 to
00:02:18.840 come
00:02:19.020 to

00:02:19.110 room
00:02:19.290 temperature
00:02:19.740 so
00:02:20.700 that's
00:02:20.850 all
00:02:21.000 combined

00:02:21.330 and
00:02:21.540 beautifully
00:02:22.020 nice
00:02:22.350 and
00:02:22.620 frothy
00:02:22.950 and
00:02:23.430 then

00:02:23.880 the
00:02:24.000 last
00:02:24.150 bit
00:02:24.360 of
00:02:24.420 prep
00:02:24.630 here
00:02:24.900 I
00:02:24.930 have
00:02:25.200 my

00:02:25.350 seasonings
00:02:25.890 salt
00:02:26.610 black
00:02:27.270 pepper
00:02:27.330 and
00:02:27.810 yes

00:02:28.820 Cayenne
00:02:29.900 so
00:02:30.900 by
00:02:31.050 then
00:02:31.230 my
00:02:31.410 potatoes
00:02:31.860 were

00:02:32.010 totally
00:02:32.520 tender
00:02:32.910 I
00:02:32.940 tested
00:02:33.510 them
00:02:33.660 with
00:02:33.690 a

00:02:33.900 knife
00:02:34.200 which
00:02:34.470 went
00:02:34.710 in
00:02:34.830 quite
00:02:35.130 easily
00:02:35.240 all

00:02:36.240 right
00:02:36.330 they
00:02:36.450 hadn't
00:02:36.720 really
00:02:36.930 fallen
00:02:37.230 apart

00:02:37.470 yet
00:02:37.710 but
00:02:38.010 they

00:03:02.160 necessary
00:03:02.700 I

00:03:02.970 don't

00:03:04.380 pieces
00:03:04.620 of

00:03:10.470 undercooked
00:03:11.400 potato
00:03:11.730 lumps

00:03:12.270 evil
00:03:12.690 a
00:03:12.900 crime
00:03:13.200 against
00:03:13.590 nature

00:03:49.500 that
00:03:49.650 part
00:03:49.920 is
00:03:50.100 the
00:03:50.250 make-ahead
00:03:50.550 you
00:03:50.880 can
00:03:51.000 do

00:03:53.100 it
00:03:53.130 you

00:03:55.800 all
00:03:56.310 right

00:03:56.430 but
00:03:56.640 that's

00:04:34.800 inside
00:04:35.360 just
00:04:36.360 really
00:04:37.020 really
00:04:37.800 decadent

00:04:43.259 but
00:04:44.129 it
00:04:44.220 almost

00:04:44.580 has
00:04:44.940 that
