00:03:33.989 going

00:03:34.110 to
00:03:34.349 poach
00:03:34.530 the
00:03:34.770 eggs
00:03:34.910 begin
00:03:35.910 by
00:03:36.060 filling
00:03:36.420 a

00:03:36.510 large

00:03:45.030 egg
00:03:45.209 whites
00:03:45.510 faster

00:03:52.319 some
00:03:53.040 members
00:03:53.370 recommend

00:03:53.790 that
00:03:53.880 you
00:03:54.000 first
00:03:54.180 break
00:03:54.480 each
