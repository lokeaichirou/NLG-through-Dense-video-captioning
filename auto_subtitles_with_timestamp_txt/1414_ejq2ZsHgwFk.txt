00:00:56.550 just
00:00:56.730 make

00:00:57.059 you
00:00:57.210 add
00:00:57.390 it

00:01:03.809 very

00:01:03.989 basic
00:01:04.229 recipe
00:01:04.860 so
00:01:05.010 it
00:01:05.129 doesn't
00:01:05.430 really
00:01:05.549 matter

00:01:05.880 in

00:01:08.610 with
00:01:08.700 dry
00:01:09.000 ingredients

00:01:09.150 so

00:01:12.810 now
00:01:13.439 you

00:01:19.650 the
00:01:20.009 pancake
00:01:20.430 batter
00:01:20.610 because
00:01:21.090 that
