00:00:45.260 Bergen
00:00:45.620 young
00:00:45.800 is
00:00:46.040 a

00:00:46.790 peasant
00:00:47.420 dish
00:00:47.680 his
00:00:48.680 history
00:00:49.190 comes
00:00:49.460 from
00:00:49.850 the

00:00:50.450 Burgundy
00:00:50.930 region
00:00:50.960 of
00:00:51.379 France
00:00:51.680 and
00:00:51.950 just
00:00:52.760 like

00:00:52.879 in
00:00:52.910 America
00:00:53.120 it
00:00:53.719 comes
00:00:54.079 from
00:00:54.170 the
00:00:54.289 concept
00:00:54.890 of

00:00:55.039 one
00:00:55.579 pot
00:00:55.850 cooking
00:00:55.879 so
00:00:56.750 the
00:00:57.260 whole
00:00:57.379 idea
00:00:57.410 of

00:00:57.770 that
00:00:57.980 as
00:00:58.100 these
00:00:58.219 dishes
00:00:58.489 were
00:00:58.760 created
00:00:59.270 by

00:00:59.629 cooking
00:00:59.960 what
00:01:00.140 was
00:01:00.230 available
00:01:00.379 at
00:01:00.920 the
00:01:00.980 time

00:01:02.020 by
00:01:03.020 the
00:01:03.050 people
00:01:03.440 what
00:01:03.649 they
00:01:03.680 had
00:01:03.920 no
00:01:04.100 most
00:01:04.520 to

00:01:04.640 them
00:01:04.729 one
00:01:04.910 of
00:01:04.940 the
00:01:05.030 things
00:01:05.180 we
00:01:05.300 talked
00:01:05.420 about

00:01:05.449 in
00:01:05.630 culinary
00:01:06.020 world
00:01:06.229 is
00:01:06.440 what
00:01:06.590 grows
00:01:06.890 together

00:01:07.160 goes
00:01:07.460 together
00:01:08.229 so
00:01:09.229 if
00:01:09.649 you're
00:01:10.100 in
00:01:10.250 a
00:01:10.340 part
00:01:10.580 of

00:01:10.640 the
00:01:10.729 world
00:01:10.910 where
00:01:11.060 they
00:01:11.270 have
00:01:11.479 beef
00:01:11.780 and
00:01:12.580 the

00:01:13.580 Burgundy
00:01:13.940 region
00:01:13.970 of
00:01:14.390 France
00:01:14.599 is
00:01:14.780 also
00:01:15.080 known

00:01:15.259 for
00:01:15.289 its
00:01:15.619 mushrooms
00:01:16.069 and
00:01:16.280 its
00:01:16.399 cheeses
00:01:16.819 and

00:01:16.970 its
00:01:17.119 wines
00:01:17.390 as
00:01:17.690 well
00:01:17.869 it
00:01:18.289 would
00:01:18.709 make
00:01:18.890 sense
00:01:18.920 to

00:01:19.310 use
00:01:19.640 those
00:01:19.849 ingredients
00:01:20.240 to
00:01:20.599 create
00:01:20.780 this

00:01:21.110 dish
00:01:21.470 so
00:01:22.160 it
00:01:22.580 was
00:01:22.759 a
00:01:22.789 way
00:01:23.000 of
00:01:23.030 taking
00:01:23.330 beef
00:01:23.750 and

00:01:24.050 cooking
00:01:24.950 it
00:01:25.039 for
00:01:25.069 extended
00:01:25.640 period
00:01:25.910 of
00:01:25.970 time

00:01:26.030 in

00:01:30.200 like
00:01:30.349 cooking
00:01:30.679 with

00:01:30.860 wine
00:01:31.039 sometimes
00:01:31.640 I
00:01:31.789 even
00:01:31.940 put
00:01:32.209 it
00:01:32.330 in
00:01:32.390 the
00:01:32.450 food

00:01:32.770 so
