00:02:26.340 gonna
00:02:26.400 squeeze
00:02:26.640 in
00:02:26.790 a

00:02:26.880 little
00:02:26.970 bit
00:02:27.150 of
00:02:27.240 lemon
00:02:27.480 juice
00:02:27.510 and
00:02:27.960 that's

00:02:28.590 pretty
00:02:28.830 much
00:02:28.950 it
00:02:29.220 and
00:02:29.550 do
00:02:30.270 you
00:02:30.360 need
00:02:30.510 to
00:02:30.570 give

00:02:30.690 it
00:02:30.780 a
00:02:30.840 mix
00:02:31.020 like
00:02:31.080 this
00:02:31.200 before
00:02:31.500 you
00:02:31.740 process
00:02:32.130 it

00:02:32.310 probably
00:02:32.940 not
00:02:33.090 I'm
00:02:33.900 not
00:02:33.960 sure
00:02:34.200 why
00:02:34.350 I
00:02:34.380 did
00:02:34.560 that

00:02:34.710 but
00:02:34.860 it's
00:02:35.010 too
00:02:35.100 late
00:02:35.250 now
00:02:35.310 but
00:02:36.300 anyway
00:02:36.570 once

00:02:36.780 all
00:02:36.900 your
00:02:37.050 ingredients
00:02:37.170 are
00:02:37.590 together
00:02:37.740 we're

00:02:38.580 simply
00:02:38.820 gonna
00:02:38.880 process
00:02:39.180 this
00:02:39.570 pulsing
00:02:40.320 on
00:02:40.440 and

00:02:40.620 off
00:02:40.710 to
00:02:40.890 start
00:02:41.100 of
00:02:41.220 course
00:02:41.250 and
00:02:41.850 what
00:02:42.660 we
00:02:42.750 want

00:02:42.930 to
00:02:43.050 end
00:02:43.170 up
00:02:43.260 with
00:02:43.440 here
00:02:43.650 is
00:02:43.710 something
00:02:43.890 that's

00:02:44.160 pretty
00:02:44.340 finely
00:02:44.850 ground
00:02:45.120 but
00:02:45.630 not
00:02:45.810 a
00:02:45.840 puree
00:02:46.230 all

00:02:47.070 right
00:02:47.160 we
00:02:47.250 don't
00:02:47.340 want
00:02:47.430 to
00:02:47.610 liquefy
00:02:48.000 this
00:02:48.060 or

00:02:48.990 turn
00:02:49.260 it
00:02:49.410 into
00:02:49.560 a
00:02:49.620 really
00:02:49.830 fine
00:02:50.130 paste
00:02:50.460 and

00:02:51.240 with
00:02:51.360 something
00:02:51.630 like
00:02:51.780 this
00:02:51.930 it's
00:02:52.140 always
00:02:52.290 a

00:02:52.380 great
00:02:52.620 idea
00:02:52.650 about
00:02:53.130 halfway
00:02:53.520 through
00:02:53.820 to
00:02:54.060 take

00:02:54.600 a
00:02:54.660 little
00:02:54.810 break
00:02:55.020 take
00:02:55.380 off
00:02:55.530 the
00:02:55.650 lid
00:02:55.860 take
00:02:56.280 a

00:02:56.340 spatula
00:02:56.870 kind
00:02:57.870 of
00:02:57.930 scrape
00:02:58.170 everything
00:02:58.440 down

00:02:58.710 off
00:02:58.890 the
00:02:59.040 sides
00:02:59.250 give
00:02:59.610 it
00:02:59.670 a
00:02:59.730 little
00:02:59.820 mix
00:03:00.060 in

00:03:00.720 case
00:03:00.900 there
00:03:01.080 are
00:03:01.170 any
00:03:01.200 large
00:03:01.530 rogue
00:03:01.980 chunks

00:03:02.490 refusing
00:03:02.970 to
00:03:03.060 get
00:03:03.180 mixed
00:03:03.450 in
00:03:03.600 so
00:03:04.350 I
00:03:04.380 did
00:03:04.620 that

00:03:04.770 and
00:03:05.040 recommend
00:03:05.580 you
00:03:05.700 do
00:03:05.820 the
00:03:05.910 same
00:03:05.940 thing
00:03:06.300 and

00:03:06.510 we'll
00:03:07.050 continue
00:03:07.200 to
00:03:07.530 blitz
00:03:07.710 that
00:03:07.980 until
00:03:08.400 like

00:03:08.520 I
00:03:08.640 said
00:03:08.820 we
00:03:08.940 have
00:03:09.030 a
00:03:09.060 very
00:03:09.150 finely
00:03:09.840 ground

00:03:10.080 mixture
00:03:10.500 and
00:03:10.770 instead
00:03:11.520 of
00:03:11.610 trying
00:03:11.760 to
00:03:11.790 think

00:03:12.000 of
00:03:12.090 a
00:03:12.150 very
00:03:12.330 clever
00:03:12.540 way
00:03:12.750 to
00:03:12.810 describe
00:03:13.140 it
00:03:13.320 let

00:03:13.440 me
00:03:13.470 just
00:03:13.530 show
00:03:13.770 you
00:03:13.830 this
00:03:14.490 is
00:03:14.670 what
00:03:14.790 I
00:03:14.820 think

00:03:14.940 you
00:03:15.120 want
00:03:15.390 all
00:03:16.020 right
00:03:16.050 very
00:03:16.290 finely
00:03:16.770 ground

00:03:17.040 but
00:03:17.280 not
00:03:17.370 pasty
00:03:17.910 so
00:03:18.300 we
00:03:18.420 don't
00:03:18.540 want
00:03:18.660 to
00:03:18.720 go
00:03:18.780 too

00:03:18.840 far
00:03:19.260 but
00:03:19.800 it
00:03:19.890 does
00:03:20.040 have
00:03:20.220 to
00:03:20.310 be
00:03:20.340 ground
00:03:20.670 fine

00:03:20.970 enough
00:03:21.239 to
00:03:21.360 hold
00:03:21.510 a
00:03:21.630 shape
00:03:21.870 because
00:03:22.500 we're

00:03:22.590 gonna
00:03:22.680 form
00:03:22.950 these
00:03:23.040 into
00:03:23.100 balls
00:03:23.280 and
00:03:23.670 or
00:03:23.850 other

00:03:24.000 shapes
00:03:24.330 soon
00:03:24.600 so
00:03:25.140 that's
00:03:25.290 looking
00:03:25.380 good
00:03:25.709 and

00:03:25.980 at
00:03:26.250 this
00:03:26.340 point
00:03:26.520 we
00:03:26.670 can
00:03:26.790 transfer
00:03:27.180 that
00:03:27.209 to
00:03:27.480 a

00:03:27.510 bowl
00:03:27.780 and
00:03:28.140 kind
00:03:28.470 of
00:03:28.500 press
00:03:28.709 it
00:03:28.739 and
00:03:28.890 pack
00:03:29.070 it

00:03:29.220 down
00:03:29.400 and
00:03:29.700 then
00:03:30.390 what
00:03:30.510 we
00:03:30.600 want
00:03:30.720 to
00:03:30.840 do
00:03:30.930 is

00:03:31.050 cover
00:03:31.260 this
00:03:31.470 and
00:03:31.770 let
00:03:32.040 it
00:03:32.070 sit
00:03:32.340 for
00:03:32.370 an
00:03:32.580 hour
00:03:32.640 or

00:03:32.910 two
00:03:32.940 before
00:03:33.209 we
00:03:33.510 start
00:03:33.720 forming
00:03:33.959 our
00:03:34.140 falafel

00:03:34.620 and
00:03:34.920 yes
00:03:35.160 I
00:03:35.280 have
00:03:35.459 done
00:03:35.580 these
00:03:35.760 without

00:03:36.030 letting
00:03:36.300 it
00:03:36.420 rest
00:03:36.570 and
00:03:36.840 it
00:03:36.900 does
00:03:37.080 work
00:03:37.320 but
00:03:37.770 by

00:03:37.890 sticking
00:03:38.190 it
00:03:38.280 in
00:03:38.370 the
00:03:38.430 fridge
00:03:38.610 for
00:03:38.670 an
00:03:38.850 hour
00:03:38.940 -

00:03:39.239 those
00:03:39.450 flavors
00:03:39.810 really
00:03:39.989 are
00:03:40.200 gonna
00:03:40.320 meld

00:03:40.560 together
00:03:40.709 and
00:03:41.580 it's
00:03:41.670 gonna
00:03:41.760 be
00:03:41.940 a
00:03:41.970 little

00:03:42.060 easier
00:03:42.270 to
00:03:42.480 work
00:03:42.570 with
00:03:42.780 which
00:03:43.320 is
00:03:43.470 never
00:03:43.620 a
00:03:43.680 bad

00:03:43.860 thing
00:03:43.890 so
00:03:44.489 I
00:03:44.520 did
00:03:44.730 pop
00:03:44.970 mine
00:03:45.120 in
00:03:45.270 the
00:03:45.360 fridge

00:03:45.540 for
00:03:45.570 a
00:03:45.780 couple
00:03:45.810 hours
00:03:46.080 after
00:03:47.040 which
00:03:47.160 we're

00:03:47.400 ready
00:03:47.580 to
00:03:47.760 shape
00:03:48.030 and
00:03:48.570 I'm
00:03:48.660 just
00:03:48.750 gonna
00:03:48.930 make

00:03:49.050 some
00:03:49.260 small
00:03:49.500 balls
00:03:49.739 I'm
00:03:49.950 gonna
00:03:50.070 use
00:03:50.160 one
00:03:50.280 of

00:03:50.310 these
00:03:50.400 little
00:03:50.640 sorbet
00:03:50.820 scoops
00:03:51.300 which

00:03:53.760 ensures
00:03:54.030 these
00:03:54.390 are
00:03:54.510 about
00:03:54.690 the
00:03:54.840 same

00:03:54.989 size
00:03:55.050 each

00:03:57.090 your
00:03:57.330 fingers

00:03:57.989 are
00:03:58.140 a
00:03:58.170 lot

00:03:58.320 easier
00:03:58.380 to
