00:00:57.110 in
00:00:57.229 a
00:00:57.320 wok
00:00:57.530 because
00:00:58.280 the

00:00:58.640 has
00:00:58.940 to
00:00:59.089 be
00:00:59.180 very
00:00:59.420 fast
00:00:59.780 and
00:01:00.050 it

00:01:00.500 becomes
00:01:00.799 easier
00:01:01.250 to
00:01:01.309 toss
00:01:01.610 all
00:01:01.820 the

00:01:01.879 vegetables

00:01:03.470 karai
00:01:03.799 with
00:01:03.979 oil

00:01:04.250 here
00:01:04.519 which
00:01:04.640 I
00:01:04.760 have
00:01:04.879 kept
00:01:05.210 to
00:01:05.420 heat
00:01:05.630 so
00:01:06.170 once

00:01:06.409 we're
00:01:06.620 done
00:01:06.770 with
00:01:06.950 the
00:01:07.070 mixture
00:01:07.430 we'll
00:01:07.610 roll

00:01:07.880 quickly
00:01:08.270 and
00:01:08.600 fry
00:01:08.900 the
00:01:08.960 spring
00:01:09.470 rolls
00:01:09.680 so
00:01:10.430 the

00:01:10.610 oil
00:01:10.820 here
00:01:11.150 in
00:01:11.360 this
00:01:11.540 wok
00:01:11.840 is
00:01:12.049 well
00:01:12.260 heated
00:01:12.530 now

00:01:13.520 we
00:01:13.579 add
00:01:14.000 spring
00:01:14.630 onions
00:01:15.020 to
00:01:15.170 this
00:01:15.350 we'll
00:01:16.009 add

00:01:16.039 some
00:01:16.579 capsicum
00:01:17.119 we'll
00:01:18.079 add
00:01:18.229 some
00:01:18.590 carrots
00:01:19.340 add

00:01:19.610 some
00:01:20.570 cabbage
00:01:21.820 now
00:01:22.820 all
00:01:23.030 these
00:01:23.240 vegetables

00:01:23.570 have
00:01:24.439 a
00:01:24.649 lot
00:01:24.859 of
00:01:24.890 moisture
00:01:25.640 so
00:01:25.880 when
00:01:26.420 you
00:01:26.539 toss

00:01:26.869 them
00:01:27.200 in
00:01:27.590 a
00:01:28.369 pan
00:01:28.640 they
00:01:29.329 automatically
00:01:30.020 reduces

00:01:30.859 in
00:01:31.009 size
00:01:31.039 it
00:01:31.549 shrinks
00:01:32.180 so
00:01:33.049 you
00:01:33.140 may
00:01:33.409 have
00:01:33.590 to

00:01:33.770 take
00:01:33.950 a
00:01:34.009 lot
00:01:34.340 of
00:01:34.490 vegetables
00:01:34.670 but
00:01:35.240 you
00:01:35.299 may
00:01:35.479 end

00:01:35.509 up

00:01:35.869 very
00:01:36.320 little
00:01:36.829 mixture
00:01:38.170 so
00:01:39.170 this

00:01:39.380 too
00:01:40.009 which
00:01:40.159 will

00:01:44.329 are
00:01:44.539 not
00:01:44.719 a
00:01:44.750 very

00:01:44.990 important
00:01:45.469 ingredient
