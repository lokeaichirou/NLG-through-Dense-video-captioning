00:00:00.329 well
00:00:01.550 it's
00:00:02.550 the
00:00:02.639 holiday
00:00:03.030 season
00:00:03.060 and
00:00:03.780 for
00:00:04.140 a

00:00:04.170 special
00:00:04.560 occasion

00:00:05.069 I
00:00:05.190 love
00:00:05.400 foie
00:00:05.640 gras
00:00:05.910 this
00:00:06.509 is
00:00:06.690 a
00:00:06.720 foie
00:00:07.020 gras

00:00:07.589 it's
00:00:07.680 a
00:00:07.919 giant
00:00:08.340 overstuffed
00:00:09.559 fat
00:00:10.559 liver
00:00:11.400 of
00:00:11.730 a

00:00:11.820 duck
00:00:11.849 or
00:00:12.300 a
00:00:12.389 goose
00:00:12.420 in
00:00:12.840 this
00:00:12.990 case
00:00:13.170 it's
00:00:13.380 a
00:00:13.469 duck

00:00:13.740 it's
00:00:14.340 from
00:00:14.549 Canada
00:00:14.870 because
00:00:15.870 the
00:00:16.049 Peter
00:00:16.230 nuts

00:00:16.500 have
00:00:16.710 made
00:00:16.920 it
00:00:17.039 so
00:00:17.190 it's
00:00:17.340 very
00:00:17.430 difficult
00:00:17.670 to

00:00:17.970 grow
00:00:18.090 these
00:00:18.330 in
00:00:18.390 the
00:00:18.570 States
00:00:18.840 and
00:00:19.109 by
00:00:19.590 the
00:00:19.650 way

00:00:19.830 if
00:00:19.949 you're
00:00:20.100 a
00:00:20.130 peanut
00:00:20.369 nut
00:00:20.670 you
00:00:20.820 can
00:00:20.970 just

00:00:21.150 switch
00:00:21.300 off
00:00:21.480 right
00:00:21.779 now
00:00:21.960 I
00:00:22.230 love
00:00:23.100 this
00:00:23.279 stuff
00:00:23.550 I

00:00:23.789 don't
00:00:23.850 care
00:00:24.090 what
00:00:24.300 anyone
00:00:24.539 thinks
00:00:24.660 I'm
00:00:25.289 going

00:00:25.590 to
00:00:25.650 eat
00:00:25.769 it
00:00:25.800 occasionally
00:00:26.369 this
00:00:27.180 is
00:00:27.300 about
00:00:27.390 a

00:00:27.449 two-pound
00:00:27.930 lobe
00:00:29.300 it's
00:00:30.300 about
00:00:30.960 100
00:00:31.349 bucks

00:00:31.560 worth
00:00:31.769 of
00:00:32.009 liver
00:00:32.369 it
00:00:33.180 doesn't
00:00:33.510 taste
00:00:33.690 at
00:00:33.899 all

00:00:33.989 like
00:00:34.200 liver
00:00:34.440 basically
00:00:35.040 it's
00:00:35.190 meat
00:00:35.399 flavored

00:00:35.820 butter
00:00:36.059 if
00:00:36.450 you
00:00:36.630 were
00:00:36.809 to
00:00:36.930 cook
00:00:37.110 this
00:00:37.290 in
00:00:37.469 an

00:00:37.559 oven
00:00:37.739 slowly
00:00:38.250 all
00:00:38.579 the
00:00:38.790 fat
00:00:39.000 would
00:00:39.180 drain
00:00:39.390 out

00:00:39.570 of
00:00:39.600 it
00:00:39.870 and
00:00:40.020 you'd
00:00:40.500 end
00:00:40.649 up
00:00:40.739 with
00:00:40.950 a
00:00:40.980 piece

00:00:41.219 about
00:00:41.399 the
00:00:41.670 size
00:00:41.700 of
00:00:42.120 a
00:00:42.180 grape
00:00:42.390 because
00:00:42.840 it's

00:00:42.989 almost
00:00:43.230 all
00:00:43.440 fat
00:00:43.710 there's
00:00:44.370 very
00:00:44.610 little
00:00:44.760 work

00:00:44.969 to
00:00:45.120 do
00:00:45.210 on
00:00:45.390 one
00:00:45.539 of
00:00:45.570 these
00:00:45.750 things
00:00:46.110 you
00:00:46.379 can
00:00:46.410 see

00:00:46.800 pretty
00:00:47.340 clearly
00:00:47.460 it
00:00:48.120 comes
00:00:48.809 in
00:00:49.020 two
00:00:49.200 pieces
00:00:49.379 so

00:00:50.309 you
00:00:50.550 can
00:00:50.820 break
00:00:51.059 the
00:00:51.239 pieces
00:00:51.449 apart
00:00:51.989 or
00:00:52.289 you

00:00:52.440 can
00:00:52.620 just
00:00:52.829 slice
00:00:53.129 it
00:00:53.160 straight
00:00:53.520 across
00:00:53.820 if
00:00:54.780 you

00:00:54.989 slice
00:00:55.230 across
00:00:55.649 that's
00:00:56.160 great
00:00:56.520 they
00:00:56.910 may
00:00:57.059 fall

00:00:57.270 apart
00:00:57.570 and
00:00:58.280 if
00:00:59.280 you
00:00:59.489 want
00:00:59.699 one
00:00:59.969 very
00:01:00.239 even

00:01:00.600 piece
00:01:00.840 you
00:01:01.079 may
00:01:01.230 find
00:01:01.559 you
00:01:02.190 want
00:01:02.399 to
00:01:02.520 slice
00:01:02.760 it

00:01:02.969 lengthwise
00:01:03.180 I'm
00:01:03.690 going
00:01:03.840 to
00:01:03.899 do
00:01:03.989 a
00:01:04.019 sort
00:01:04.199 of
00:01:04.260 a

00:01:04.350 combination
00:01:04.710 of
00:01:04.920 both
00:01:04.979 by
00:01:05.820 slicing
00:01:06.210 it
00:01:06.510 sort

00:01:06.840 of
00:01:06.869 diagonally
00:01:07.680 along
00:01:08.430 with
00:01:08.729 the
00:01:08.909 crease

00:01:09.150 that's
00:01:09.450 in
00:01:09.630 here
00:01:09.900 so
00:01:10.680 that
00:01:10.890 if
00:01:10.979 in
00:01:11.130 case
00:01:11.310 the

00:01:11.520 pieces
00:01:11.850 do
00:01:12.000 sort
00:01:12.240 of
00:01:12.299 fall
00:01:12.479 apart
00:01:12.780 there's

00:01:13.049 minimal
00:01:13.260 waste
00:01:14.299 it
00:01:15.299 did
00:01:15.570 cost
00:01:15.810 as
00:01:16.020 I
00:01:16.140 said

00:01:16.350 about
00:01:16.530 $100
00:01:17.189 it's
00:01:17.430 about
00:01:17.580 50
00:01:17.939 bucks
00:01:18.150 a
00:01:18.270 pound

00:01:18.830 however
00:01:19.830 you're
00:01:20.220 going
00:01:20.310 to
00:01:20.400 get
00:01:20.549 a
00:01:20.580 good
00:01:20.850 12
00:01:21.390 to

00:01:21.570 16
00:01:21.960 servings
00:01:22.259 out
00:01:22.530 of
00:01:22.590 this
00:01:22.830 thing
00:01:23.009 so
00:01:23.220 it's

00:01:24.060 not
00:01:24.299 exactly
00:01:24.960 what
00:01:25.170 you
00:01:25.259 would
00:01:25.350 call

00:01:25.409 economical
00:01:26.189 but
00:01:26.460 it's
00:01:26.610 not
00:01:26.790 that
00:01:27.060 hard

00:01:27.240 stopping
00:01:27.659 the
00:01:27.780 expensive
00:01:28.259 either
00:01:28.409 ah
00:01:28.710 the

00:01:29.700 best
00:01:29.970 way
00:01:30.150 to
00:01:30.210 cut
00:01:30.540 is
00:01:30.810 to
00:01:31.020 use
00:01:31.140 a
00:01:31.170 long
00:01:31.470 thin

00:01:32.009 knife
00:01:32.670 like
00:01:33.060 a
00:01:33.090 carving
00:01:33.659 knife
00:01:33.689 and
00:01:35.060 wash
00:01:36.060 it

00:01:36.329 in
00:01:36.450 hot
00:01:36.479 water
00:01:36.689 between
00:01:37.530 cuts
00:01:38.070 the
00:01:38.640 hot
00:01:38.820 blade

00:01:39.119 of
00:01:39.270 the
00:01:39.329 knife
00:01:39.479 will
00:01:39.869 cut
00:01:40.110 right
00:01:40.140 through
00:01:40.380 it

00:01:40.650 like
00:01:40.799 butter
00:01:41.009 and
00:01:41.750 make
00:01:42.750 very
00:01:42.990 nice
00:01:43.170 clean

00:01:43.530 cuts
00:01:43.829 so
00:01:44.040 I'm
00:01:44.100 going
00:01:44.220 to
00:01:44.280 fill
00:01:44.460 up
00:01:44.579 a
00:01:44.640 picture

00:01:44.880 and
00:01:45.420 use
00:01:45.540 that
00:01:45.689 to
00:01:45.840 warm
00:01:45.990 up
00:01:46.140 my
00:01:46.170 neck
00:01:46.500 we
00:01:47.220 made

00:01:47.399 four
00:01:47.670 portions
00:01:48.180 of
00:01:48.360 this
00:01:48.479 appetizer
00:01:48.990 one
00:01:49.649 of

00:01:49.770 these
00:01:49.950 giant
00:01:50.850 flaws
00:01:51.090 would
00:01:51.420 obviously
00:01:51.750 make
00:01:52.079 a

00:01:52.110 lot
00:01:52.320 more
00:01:52.500 than
00:01:52.710 that
00:01:54.200 the
00:01:55.200 other
00:01:55.380 thing
00:01:55.619 to

00:01:55.770 remember
00:01:55.799 is
00:01:56.640 we're
00:01:56.880 going
00:01:57.000 to
00:01:57.060 use
00:01:57.240 all
00:01:57.509 the

00:01:57.719 fat
00:01:57.960 that
00:01:57.990 comes
00:01:58.380 off
00:01:58.680 this
00:01:58.979 to
00:01:59.189 cook

00:01:59.430 everything
00:01:59.820 else
00:02:00.149 so
00:02:00.719 we're
00:02:00.869 doing
00:02:00.960 it
00:02:01.110 in
00:02:01.229 a

00:02:01.320 skillet
00:02:01.619 we're
00:02:01.829 not
00:02:01.979 going
00:02:02.159 throw
00:02:02.280 any
00:02:02.460 of
00:02:02.610 the

00:02:02.700 fat
00:02:02.939 away
00:02:03.229 but
00:02:05.180 nice
00:02:06.180 slice
00:02:06.659 about
00:02:07.500 a
00:02:07.680 quarter

00:02:08.069 of
00:02:08.190 an
00:02:08.280 inch
00:02:08.369 thick
00:02:08.670 foie
00:02:09.179 gras
00:02:09.479 experts
00:02:10.020 out

00:02:10.170 there
00:02:10.379 will
00:02:10.530 tell
00:02:10.560 you

00:02:10.970 you
00:02:11.060 need
00:02:11.240 to
00:02:11.390 clean
00:02:11.720 the
00:02:12.290 nerves
00:02:12.560 and
00:02:12.860 veins

00:02:13.070 out
00:02:13.400 of
00:02:13.550 this
00:02:13.730 thing
00:02:13.970 I
00:02:14.660 think
00:02:15.230 that's

00:02:15.410 completely
00:02:15.590 unnecessary
00:02:16.070 in
00:02:16.730 a
00:02:16.820 waste
00:02:17.000 of

00:02:17.120 time
00:02:17.360 and
00:02:17.720 will
00:02:18.200 actually
00:02:18.380 ruin
00:02:18.980 the
00:02:19.070 way
00:02:19.220 the

00:02:20.060 foie
00:02:20.360 gras
00:02:20.600 looks
00:02:20.840 because
00:02:21.050 you're
00:02:21.140 going
00:02:21.230 to

00:02:21.320 tear
00:02:21.530 it
00:02:21.560 up
00:02:21.710 into
00:02:21.890 pieces

00:02:31.120 so
00:02:31.810 I
00:02:31.840 have
00:02:31.989 four
00:02:32.319 very
00:02:32.680 nice
00:02:32.890 slices
00:02:33.459 here

00:02:33.720 these
00:02:34.720 don't
00:02:34.930 need
00:02:35.080 very
00:02:35.290 much
00:02:35.470 seasoning

00:02:35.800 except
00:02:36.370 for
00:02:36.519 just
00:02:36.670 a
00:02:36.760 little
00:02:36.910 salt
00:02:37.269 and
00:02:37.390 pepper

00:02:37.750 I
00:02:37.870 wouldn't
00:02:38.319 put
00:02:38.470 very
00:02:38.709 much
00:02:38.800 I
00:02:39.160 will
00:02:39.310 sprinkle
