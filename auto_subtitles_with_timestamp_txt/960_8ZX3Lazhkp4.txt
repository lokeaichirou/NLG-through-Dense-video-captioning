00:00:35.100 runny
00:00:35.370 nose

00:00:35.730 white
00:00:36.120 is
00:00:36.510 the
00:00:36.719 kind
00:00:36.930 that
00:00:37.079 causes
00:00:37.469 problems

00:00:37.710 during
00:00:38.250 poaching
00:00:38.760 the
00:00:39.149 best
00:00:39.420 way
00:00:39.629 to

00:00:40.350 is
00:00:40.530 to
00:00:40.800 remove
00:00:41.100 it
00:00:41.280 before
00:00:41.550 the

00:00:43.110 wait
00:00:43.890 a
00:00:43.920 few
00:00:44.190 seconds
00:00:44.550 for

00:00:44.640 the
00:00:44.789 thin
00:00:45.059 white
00:00:45.329 to

00:00:48.420 and
00:00:48.570 pour
00:00:49.200 the
00:00:49.440 egg

00:00:49.620 into
00:00:49.980 a
00:00:50.219 small
00:00:50.579 ramekin
00:00:51.390 or
00:00:51.570 cup
00:00:51.840 I
00:00:52.140 have
00:00:52.980 a
00:00:53.010 2

00:00:53.280 quart
00:00:53.610 pot
00:00:54.000 but
00:00:54.600 slightly
00:00:55.230 more
00:00:55.410 than
00:00:55.440 2

00:00:55.649 inches
00:00:55.680 of
00:00:56.039 water
00:00:56.219 here
00:00:56.699 which
00:00:57.329 is
00:00:57.480 the

00:00:57.629 minimum
00:00:57.899 we
00:00:58.289 need
00:00:58.320 for
00:00:58.680 poaching
00:00:59.090 let's

00:01:00.090 season
00:01:00.420 that
00:01:00.660 the
00:01:00.780 paste
00:01:01.020 with
00:01:01.260 salt
00:01:01.590 and

00:01:01.920 bring
00:01:02.309 to
00:01:02.520 a
00:01:02.550 boil
00:01:03.470 once
00:01:04.470 you
00:01:04.650 get
00:01:04.799 a
00:01:04.830 boil
00:01:05.159 turn

00:01:05.430 down
00:01:06.150 your
00:01:06.390 pot
00:01:06.600 to
00:01:06.840 very
00:01:07.260 low
00:01:07.680 the
00:01:08.460 water

00:01:08.820 should
00:01:09.150 be
00:01:09.210 barely
00:01:09.600 simmering
00:01:10.310 take
00:01:11.310 a
00:01:11.340 spoon

00:01:11.850 and
00:01:12.060 stir
00:01:12.750 the
00:01:13.020 water
00:01:13.290 to
00:01:13.560 create
00:01:13.740 a
00:01:14.070 vortex
00:01:14.509 it

00:01:15.509 doesn't
00:01:15.960 need
00:01:16.140 to
00:01:16.290 be
00:01:16.320 a
00:01:16.439 violent
00:01:16.890 vortex

00:01:17.430 input
00:01:18.180 two
00:01:18.390 revolutions
00:01:18.930 of
00:01:19.080 the
00:01:19.229 spoon
00:01:19.470 per

00:01:19.650 second
00:01:20.150 as
00:01:21.150 soon
00:01:21.420 as
00:01:21.540 I'll
00:01:21.689 stop
00:01:21.900 stirring

00:01:22.170 I'll
00:01:22.530 bring
00:01:23.100 my
00:01:23.340 cup
00:01:23.580 with
00:01:24.000 the
00:01:24.210 egg
00:01:24.390 to
00:01:25.049 the

00:01:25.080 very
00:01:25.590 surface
00:01:26.070 of
00:01:26.490 the
00:01:26.729 water
00:01:26.939 and
00:01:27.270 boom
00:01:28.130 the

00:01:29.130 egg
00:01:29.310 leads
00:01:29.640 to
00:01:29.790 go
00:01:29.939 into
00:01:30.180 the
00:01:30.270 pot
00:01:30.479 in
00:01:30.689 one
00:01:31.079 fast

00:01:31.500 motion
00:01:32.130 or
00:01:32.430 the
00:01:32.670 yolk
00:01:32.970 might
00:01:33.450 lose
00:01:33.720 the
00:01:33.990 white

00:01:34.340 the
00:01:35.340 reason
00:01:35.729 we
00:01:35.880 need
00:01:36.000 the
00:01:36.150 vortex
00:01:36.659 is
00:01:36.900 to
00:01:37.259 wrap

00:01:37.470 the
00:01:37.619 white
00:01:37.799 around
00:01:37.979 the
00:01:38.250 yolk
00:01:38.340 and
00:01:38.759 give
00:01:38.909 the

00:01:39.060 beautiful
00:01:39.180 cut
00:01:39.900 that
00:01:40.079 shape
00:01:40.290 it
00:01:40.770 also
00:01:41.070 helps

00:01:41.850 the
00:01:42.090 white
00:01:42.299 coagulant
00:01:42.960 faster
00:01:43.350 when
00:01:44.130 a
00:01:44.369 cold

00:01:44.670 air
00:01:44.939 gov
00:01:45.210 fully
00:01:45.659 oven
00:01:45.930 70
00:01:46.259 degrees
00:01:46.560 goes
00:01:46.799 into

00:01:47.220 a
00:01:47.250 200
00:01:47.939 degree
00:01:48.060 water
00:01:48.540 the
00:01:49.439 water
00:01:49.680 immediately

00:01:49.950 around
00:01:50.520 the
00:01:50.610 egg
00:01:50.820 goes
00:01:51.149 off
00:01:51.420 when
00:01:52.229 you
00:01:52.470 make

00:01:52.829 the
00:01:53.070 water
00:01:53.280 move
00:01:53.670 new
00:01:54.329 hot
00:01:54.570 waters
00:01:54.990 washed

00:01:55.320 over
00:01:55.560 the
00:01:55.590 egg
00:01:55.829 constantly
00:01:56.640 helping
00:01:57.420 the

00:01:57.659 white
00:01:57.810 coagulate
00:01:58.469 it
00:01:58.950 works
00:01:59.189 just
00:01:59.399 like
00:01:59.520 the

00:01:59.640 convection
00:02:00.390 fan
00:02:00.630 in
00:02:00.930 your
00:02:01.140 oven
00:02:01.439 when
00:02:02.280 the
00:02:02.399 egg

00:02:02.610 just
00:02:03.119 starts
00:02:03.600 to
00:02:03.810 set
00:02:04.049 about
00:02:04.439 30
00:02:04.770 seconds

00:02:05.270 that
00:02:05.539 goes
00:02:05.750 into
00:02:05.990 the
00:02:06.140 pot
00:02:06.320 I
00:02:06.560 stir
00:02:06.890 the
00:02:07.579 water

00:02:07.820 gently
00:02:08.479 around
00:02:08.599 it
00:02:08.989 until
00:02:09.200 it
00:02:09.619 lets
00:02:09.830 go
00:02:10.099 of
00:02:10.190 the

00:02:10.340 bottom
00:02:10.670 this
00:02:11.420 one
00:02:11.660 wasn't
00:02:11.930 there
00:02:12.170 once
00:02:12.290 that

00:02:12.530 but
00:02:13.160 it
00:02:13.400 never
00:02:13.700 hurts
00:02:14.000 to
00:02:14.120 stir
00:02:14.390 the
00:02:14.540 pot
00:02:14.720 a
00:02:14.750 bit

00:02:15.290 note
00:02:16.190 how
00:02:16.459 the
00:02:16.489 water
00:02:16.849 is
00:02:17.120 not
00:02:17.269 bubbling
00:02:17.750 at

00:02:17.930 all
00:02:18.200 by
00:02:18.379 now
00:02:18.560 not
00:02:19.099 even
00:02:19.340 the
00:02:19.640 tiniest
00:02:19.879 bubble

00:02:20.420 if
00:02:20.870 he's
00:02:21.080 used
00:02:21.379 thermometer
00:02:22.160 to
00:02:22.340 check
00:02:22.580 it
00:02:22.760 it

00:02:23.090 should
00:02:23.420 stay
00:02:23.690 under
00:02:23.930 200
00:02:24.769 to
00:02:25.370 keep
00:02:25.610 the
00:02:25.849 white

00:02:26.060 tender
00:02:26.780 we
00:02:27.170 need
00:02:27.319 to
00:02:27.470 keep
00:02:27.620 things
00:02:27.860 just
00:02:28.040 below

00:02:28.940 a
00:02:28.970 simmer
00:02:29.739 the
00:02:30.739 total
00:02:31.069 cooking
00:02:31.280 time
00:02:31.400 for
00:02:31.549 an

00:02:31.819 egg
00:02:31.970 varies
00:02:32.420 between
00:02:32.540 three
00:02:33.019 and
00:02:33.049 five

00:02:33.349 minutes
00:02:33.769 depending
00:02:33.920 on
00:02:34.459 how
00:02:34.640 much
00:02:34.760 water
00:02:35.030 you

00:02:35.209 have
00:02:35.360 in
00:02:35.480 the
00:02:35.569 pot
00:02:35.750 how
00:02:36.410 much
00:02:36.620 work
00:02:36.860 you

00:02:37.069 drained
00:02:37.340 off

00:02:37.790 how
00:02:38.329 well
00:02:38.660 done
00:02:38.989 you
00:02:39.230 like

00:02:39.410 you
00:02:39.590 yolks
00:02:39.829 I
00:02:40.160 like
00:02:40.730 my
00:02:40.880 yolks
00:02:41.090 runny
00:02:41.360 and

00:02:42.860 in
00:02:43.130 a
00:02:43.280 small
00:02:43.640 pot
00:02:43.970 we'll
00:02:44.480 get
00:02:44.750 there

00:02:44.959 in
00:02:44.989 about
00:02:45.349 four
00:02:45.650 minutes
00:02:46.299 let's
00:02:47.299 get
00:02:47.480 our
