00:00:23.430 and

00:00:23.970 onion
00:00:24.600 agree
00:00:24.810 one
00:00:25.560 thing
00:00:25.770 to
00:00:25.890 remember
00:00:25.980 when

00:00:26.340 you

00:00:26.759 you're
00:00:26.880 going
00:00:27.000 to
00:00:27.090 do
00:00:27.180 a

00:00:27.210 straightforward
00:00:27.540 mashed
00:00:27.960 potato
00:00:28.349 it
00:00:28.500 is
00:00:28.680 your

00:00:29.189 potatoes
00:00:29.670 need
00:00:29.910 to
00:00:30.060 be
00:00:30.150 cooked
00:00:30.360 fairly
00:00:30.810 evenly

00:00:31.110 in
00:00:31.290 size
00:00:32.000 so
00:00:33.000 they're
00:00:33.180 all
00:00:33.330 roughly
00:00:33.840 the
00:00:33.989 same

00:00:34.260 size
00:00:34.530 so
00:00:34.770 I
00:00:34.800 have
00:00:34.949 to
00:00:35.070 measure
00:00:35.190 them
00:00:35.400 but

00:00:35.610 roughly
00:00:35.910 the
00:00:36.030 same
00:00:36.180 size
00:00:37.250 the
00:00:38.250 other
00:00:38.400 thing
00:00:38.610 is

00:00:38.760 with
00:00:39.570 mashed
00:00:40.320 potatoes
00:00:40.410 you'll
00:00:41.070 generally

00:00:41.670 start
00:00:42.000 them
00:00:42.150 off
00:00:42.300 in
00:00:42.510 cold
00:00:43.019 water
00:00:43.320 if
00:00:43.920 you're

00:00:44.040 doing
00:00:44.220 new
00:00:44.430 potatoes
00:00:44.940 you
00:00:45.720 would
00:00:45.840 normally

00:00:46.110 start
00:00:46.290 them
00:00:46.440 off
00:00:46.500 in
00:00:46.530 boiling
00:00:46.949 water
00:00:47.100 so
00:00:47.879 these

00:00:48.000 are
00:00:48.180 in
00:00:48.269 cold
00:00:48.449 water
00:00:48.720 and
00:00:49.080 they're
00:00:49.650 going
00:00:49.769 to

00:00:49.860 just
00:00:49.980 go
00:00:50.160 on
00:00:50.250 the
00:00:53.059 salt
00:00:55.309 not
00:00:56.309 too
00:00:56.370 much
00:00:56.580 as

00:00:56.940 although
00:00:57.150 just
00:00:57.449 dip
00:00:57.920 at
00:00:58.920 the
00:00:59.040 end
00:00:59.190 of
00:00:59.309 it
00:00:59.400 went

00:00:59.549 up

00:01:03.750 going
00:01:03.839 to
00:01:03.900 boil
00:01:04.080 now
00:01:04.290 for
00:01:04.500 about

00:01:04.640 about
00:01:05.640 20
00:01:06.090 minutes
00:01:06.330 or
00:01:06.390 so
00:01:06.450 that's
00:01:06.930 from

00:01:07.260 boiling
00:01:07.710 on
