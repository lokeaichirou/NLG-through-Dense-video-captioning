00:01:13.859 now
00:01:14.609 first
00:01:15.000 of
00:01:15.210 all
00:01:15.329 you're

00:01:17.219 into
00:01:17.880 the
00:01:18.000 pot
00:01:18.240 and

00:01:25.690 you
00:01:26.380 do
00:01:26.590 not

00:01:26.770 want
00:01:27.100 to
00:01:27.250 boil
00:01:27.550 missile
00:01:28.240 the
00:01:28.900 reason
00:01:29.290 is
00:01:29.500 it's

00:01:29.800 a
00:01:29.950 fermented
00:01:30.460 food

00:01:33.480 microorganism
00:01:34.480 living
00:01:34.510 inside

00:01:36.370 you

00:01:36.850 boil
00:01:37.240 this
00:01:37.480 the
00:01:37.720 harsh
00:01:38.020 heat
00:01:38.590 will
00:01:38.970 destroy

00:01:39.970 the
00:01:40.390 flavor
00:01:41.200 and
00:01:41.650 it
00:01:42.400 just
00:01:42.850 doesn't
00:01:43.150 taste

00:01:43.330 good
00:01:43.630 so
00:01:44.370 whatever
00:01:45.370 you

00:02:41.480 but
00:02:41.810 this
00:02:42.050 is
00:02:42.230 all
00:02:42.500 depends

00:02:46.489 more
00:02:46.850 saltier
00:02:47.390 than
00:02:47.450 the
00:02:47.630 other

00:02:51.980 you
00:02:52.069 have
00:02:52.250 three
00:02:52.280 cups

00:02:53.360 put
00:02:54.200 2
00:02:54.620 tbsp
00:02:55.400 first
00:02:55.819 and
00:02:56.209 then
00:02:56.600 taste
00:02:56.959 and
00:02:57.380 if

00:02:57.560 you
00:02:57.680 need
00:02:57.920 some

00:02:59.299 one
00:02:59.720 more
00:02:59.959 ok

00:03:00.830 so
00:03:00.890 this
00:03:01.370 is
00:03:01.580 how
00:03:01.610 you
00:03:01.819 do
00:03:02.060 this
00:03:02.239 you
00:03:03.200 don't

00:03:03.319 have
00:03:03.440 to
00:03:03.650 have
00:03:03.860 this
00:03:04.100 one
00:03:04.160 you
00:03:04.730 just
00:03:05.060 need
00:03:05.480 a

00:03:05.510 regular
00:03:06.410 strainer
00:03:07.130 and
00:03:09.489 let
00:03:10.489 go
00:03:10.790 so
00:03:11.480 all
00:03:11.840 you

00:03:12.080 do
00:03:12.350 is
00:03:12.380 just
00:03:13.100 mix
00:03:13.459 this
00:03:13.819 and
00:03:14.260 make
00:03:15.260 sure

00:03:16.150 everything
00:03:17.150 is
00:03:17.420 dissolved
00:03:18.880 think
00:03:19.880 so
00:03:25.989 it's

00:03:26.989 all
00:03:27.109 dissolved
00:03:34.660 there
00:03:35.660 we
00:03:35.870 go

00:03:37.630 and
00:03:38.630 then
00:03:39.260 you're
00:03:39.590 going
00:03:39.709 to
00:03:39.769 turn
00:03:40.130 on
00:03:40.400 the

00:03:41.390 heat
00:03:41.720 again
00:03:42.350 but
00:03:43.340 this
00:03:43.670 time
00:03:43.730 you're
00:03:44.510 just

00:03:44.780 warming
00:03:45.079 this
00:03:45.410 up
00:03:45.650 not
00:03:46.100 boiling
00:03:46.640 it
00:03:47.410 so
00:03:48.410 this

00:03:48.769 is
00:03:49.100 already
00:03:49.489 a
00:03:50.090 good
00:03:50.590 temperature
00:03:51.590 and
00:03:51.799 it's

00:03:52.190 ready
00:03:52.489 to
00:03:52.700 be
00:03:52.820 served

00:03:53.390 now
00:03:54.140 you're

00:03:55.910 and
00:03:56.890 just
00:03:58.750 scoop

00:04:03.230 then
00:04:04.230 I
