00:02:47.320 our
00:02:47.530 mashed
00:02:48.010 potato
00:02:48.370 so

00:02:49.090 a
00:02:49.120 couple
00:02:49.480 of
00:02:49.660 tips
00:02:49.840 for

00:02:52.630 your
00:02:52.840 potatoes
00:02:53.320 i
00:02:53.560 use
00:02:53.739 reis
00:02:53.980 /

00:02:54.100 tato
00:02:54.400 so
00:02:55.090 there
00:02:55.450 is
00:02:55.480 licensed
00:02:56.080 floppy
00:02:56.410 as

00:02:56.590 possible
00:02:57.040 I
00:02:57.250 listened
00:02:58.000 to
00:02:58.060 drain
00:02:58.420 in
00:02:58.660 a

00:02:58.810 colander
00:02:58.959 so
00:02:59.470 some
00:02:59.709 of
00:02:59.830 the
00:03:00.519 moisture
00:03:00.670 is

00:03:00.940 going
00:03:01.090 to
00:03:01.150 evaporate
00:03:01.299 and
00:03:01.840 in
00:03:02.350 this
00:03:02.500 patch

00:03:02.799 I've
00:03:03.070 heated
00:03:03.610 up
00:03:03.910 butter
00:03:04.480 and
00:03:04.780 creme
00:03:05.049 fraiche

00:03:05.320 so
00:03:05.920 any
00:03:06.130 liquid
00:03:06.730 you
00:03:06.850 using
00:03:07.269 needs
00:03:07.600 to
00:03:07.690 be

00:03:07.750 piping
00:03:08.290 hot
00:03:08.500 before
00:03:09.370 adding
00:03:09.730 to
00:03:09.820 the
00:03:09.940 potato

00:03:10.269 if
00:03:10.660 you
00:03:11.170 don't
00:03:11.380 make
00:03:11.620 sure
00:03:11.799 it's
00:03:11.920 piping
00:03:12.250 hot

00:03:12.310 the
00:03:12.940 potato
00:03:13.299 will
00:03:13.570 have
00:03:13.660 this
00:03:13.720 really
00:03:13.900 weird

00:03:14.230 glue-like
00:03:14.739 consistency
00:03:15.190 like
00:03:15.910 carpentry

00:03:16.480 view
00:03:16.690 it's
00:03:16.810 really
00:03:17.260 really
00:03:17.470 not
00:03:17.590 nice
00:03:17.799 so
00:03:18.700 I've

00:03:18.880 used
00:03:19.239 a
00:03:19.420 creme
00:03:19.630 fraiche
00:03:19.930 which
00:03:20.260 is
00:03:20.500 a
00:03:20.560 sour

00:03:20.890 cream

00:03:22.030 nice
00:03:22.329 and
00:03:22.540 thick

00:03:25.390 little
00:03:25.570 bit

00:03:25.690 more
00:03:25.930 I

00:03:31.650 of
00:03:31.830 black
00:03:32.040 pepper
00:03:32.069 and
00:03:33.110 now
00:03:34.110 it's
00:03:34.290 just
00:03:34.349 a

00:03:34.470 little
00:03:34.590 bit
00:03:34.739 of
00:03:34.800 elbow
00:03:35.069 grease
00:03:39.560 now
00:03:40.560 you
00:03:40.620 need

00:03:40.800 to
00:03:40.830 make
00:03:41.099 sure
00:03:41.130 that
00:03:41.970 your
00:03:42.120 potatoes
00:03:42.540 are

00:03:42.720 piping
00:03:43.080 hot

00:03:44.430 mashing

00:03:44.580 them

00:03:45.750 they
00:03:45.810 go
00:03:46.140 gray
00:03:46.790 and
00:03:47.790 it

00:03:48.390 doesn't
00:03:48.690 really
00:03:48.810 affect
00:03:48.930 the
00:03:49.290 flavor
00:03:49.580 but
00:03:50.580 it

00:03:50.730 just
00:03:50.910 doesn't
00:03:51.060 look
00:03:51.360 very
00:03:51.420 nice
