00:03:55.600 little

00:03:55.810 bit

00:03:56.590 little
00:03:56.709 bit
00:03:57.040 more
00:03:57.070 a
00:03:57.310 lot

00:03:57.610 depends
00:03:58.120 on
00:03:58.269 how
00:03:58.510 tender

00:04:04.570 the

00:04:04.930 middle
00:04:05.200 parts
00:04:05.560 because
00:04:06.160 that's
00:04:06.370 really
00:04:06.579 tough

00:04:06.910 and
00:04:07.120 you
00:04:07.180 don't
00:04:07.360 want
00:04:07.510 that
00:04:07.570 in
00:04:07.780 your
00:04:07.930 soup
00:04:08.200 or

00:04:08.960 really
00:04:09.260 for
00:04:10.220 the
00:04:10.310 most
00:04:10.550 part
00:04:10.820 you
00:04:11.540 can
00:04:11.690 see

00:04:11.720 this
00:04:11.960 looks
00:04:12.260 like
00:04:12.410 a
00:04:12.470 lot
00:04:12.830 but
00:04:13.040 it's
00:04:13.220 really

00:04:13.490 going
00:04:13.760 to
00:04:13.820 wilt
00:04:14.120 down
00:04:14.210 into
00:04:14.870 the
00:04:14.990 soup
00:04:15.230 and

00:04:15.500 plus
00:04:16.010 is
00:04:16.190 good
00:04:16.430 for
00:04:16.700 you
00:04:16.820 I
00:04:17.120 would
00:04:17.540 struggle
00:04:17.720 to

00:04:17.900 eat
00:04:18.140 this
00:04:18.290 much
00:04:18.530 kale
00:04:18.860 if
00:04:19.100 it
00:04:19.250 wasn't
00:04:19.670 all

00:04:20.030 wilted
00:04:20.750 and
00:04:21.020 in
00:04:21.350 a
00:04:21.380 soup
00:04:21.760 so
00:04:22.760 I
00:04:22.790 mean
00:04:23.090 at
00:04:23.330 that

00:04:23.630 and
00:04:24.590 I
00:04:24.650 actually
00:04:24.860 just
00:04:25.220 like
00:04:25.370 to
00:04:25.520 add
00:04:25.670 my
00:04:25.880 pasta

00:04:26.090 at
00:04:26.570 the
00:04:26.690 same
00:04:26.930 time
00:04:27.260 so
00:04:27.770 I
00:04:27.800 have
00:04:28.100 my
00:04:28.370 elbow

00:04:29.360 pasta

00:04:31.760 box
00:04:32.030 so
00:04:32.420 I
00:04:32.450 guess
00:04:32.690 that's
00:04:32.870 about

00:04:33.220 250
00:04:34.220 grams
