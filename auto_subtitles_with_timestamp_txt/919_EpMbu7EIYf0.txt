00:03:10.700 seconds
00:03:11.299 okay
00:03:11.840 mix

00:03:12.380 again
00:03:13.120 so
00:03:14.120 basically
00:03:14.480 what
00:03:14.720 you
00:03:14.840 want
00:03:15.049 is
00:03:15.200 the

00:03:15.350 excess
00:03:15.739 milk
00:03:16.040 here
00:03:17.019 then
00:03:18.019 it's
00:03:18.170 have
00:03:18.260 a
00:03:18.350 bit

00:03:18.470 too
00:03:18.650 much
00:03:18.860 than
00:03:19.100 not
00:03:19.130 enough
00:03:19.250 is
00:03:19.640 there
00:03:20.239 will

00:03:20.360 be
00:03:20.390 some
00:03:20.600 excess
00:03:20.959 milk
00:03:21.200 if
00:03:21.350 you
00:03:21.380 put
00:03:21.590 a
00:03:21.620 little

00:03:21.769 bit
00:03:21.950 too
00:03:22.130 much
00:03:22.340 in
00:03:22.580 which
00:03:22.880 is
00:03:23.030 what
00:03:23.150 I
00:03:23.180 like
00:03:23.480 to

00:03:23.600 do
00:03:23.750 and
00:03:23.959 then
00:03:24.410 you
00:03:24.620 let
00:03:24.830 that
00:03:24.950 evaporate

00:03:25.610 slowly
00:03:25.820 that
00:03:26.570 way
00:03:26.750 it
00:03:26.900 slowly
00:03:27.410 cooks
00:03:27.860 the
00:03:28.010 eggs

00:03:28.510 so
00:03:29.510 rather
00:03:29.870 than
00:03:30.080 rushing
00:03:30.260 and
00:03:30.650 often
00:03:31.070 people

00:03:31.310 make
00:03:31.700 eggs
00:03:32.030 don't

00:03:32.989 ingredients
00:03:33.560 in

00:03:38.060 flavorless
00:03:38.720 well
00:03:38.989 do
00:03:39.680 it
00:03:39.830 this
00:03:39.950 way

00:03:40.220 spit
00:03:40.790 you
00:03:40.910 just
00:03:41.120 spend
00:03:41.330 an
00:03:41.420 extra
00:03:41.599 few
00:03:41.900 minutes

00:03:41.930 they
