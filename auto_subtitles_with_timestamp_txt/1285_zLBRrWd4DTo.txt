00:00:36.600 ground

00:00:41.460 your

00:00:41.640 ground
00:00:41.879 beef
00:00:42.059 I'll
00:00:42.629 lift
00:00:42.960 it
00:00:43.079 up
00:00:43.230 a
00:00:43.290 little
00:00:43.440 bit

00:00:46.190 and
00:00:47.190 smooth
00:00:48.000 it
00:00:48.180 out
00:00:49.399 but
00:00:50.399 you
00:00:50.460 want
00:00:50.610 to
00:00:50.640 make

00:00:50.760 sure
00:00:50.789 it
00:00:50.969 doesn't
00:00:51.300 really
00:00:51.420 stick
00:00:51.930 you're
00:00:52.440 just

00:00:52.590 kind
00:00:52.800 of
00:00:52.940 smoothing
00:00:53.940 it
00:00:54.059 out
00:00:54.120 to
00:00:54.270 the
00:00:54.390 point
00:00:54.660 to

00:00:54.870 where
00:00:55.020 you're
00:00:55.860 gonna
00:00:55.920 cut
00:00:56.250 it
00:00:56.370 into
00:00:56.489 little

00:00:56.670 square
00:00:57.059 patties
00:01:05.600 once
00:01:06.600 you've
00:01:06.750 got
00:01:06.930 it
00:01:06.960 all

00:01:07.140 flattened
00:01:07.530 out
00:01:07.619 and
00:01:07.680 you
00:01:08.070 can
00:01:08.220 use
00:01:08.310 a
00:01:08.340 rolling

00:01:08.760 pin
00:01:08.909 just
00:01:09.210 use
00:01:09.330 it
00:01:09.479 lightly
00:01:09.689 and
00:01:10.110 I
00:01:10.500 would

00:01:10.619 recommend
00:01:11.040 using
00:01:11.159 waxed
00:01:11.610 paper
00:01:11.640 instead
00:01:12.090 of

00:01:12.210 foil
00:01:12.540 but
00:01:12.810 I
00:01:12.869 don't
00:01:13.049 have
00:01:13.200 that
00:01:13.409 not
00:01:13.950 a
00:01:13.979 problem

00:01:14.280 you
00:01:14.430 can
00:01:14.549 still
00:01:14.760 use
00:01:14.970 it
00:01:16.189 it
00:01:17.189 will
00:01:17.369 come
00:01:17.580 off

00:01:17.729 but
00:01:18.240 wax
00:01:18.479 paper
00:01:18.720 is
00:01:18.869 better
00:01:19.049 because
00:01:19.170 it

00:01:19.320 slides
00:01:19.500 off
00:01:19.740 easier
00:01:20.070 what
00:01:20.610 you're
00:01:20.759 doing
00:01:21.030 now

00:01:21.150 is
00:01:21.180 that
00:01:21.479 you've
00:01:21.600 made
00:01:21.750 it
00:01:21.869 flat
00:01:22.140 enough
00:01:22.290 as

00:01:22.590 you're
00:01:22.740 making
00:01:23.130 those
00:01:23.310 actual
00:01:24.200 beautifully

00:01:25.200 thin
00:01:25.470 slider
00:01:26.430 patties
00:01:26.880 you
00:01:27.090 don't
00:01:27.930 want
00:01:28.049 them

00:01:28.140 too
00:01:28.259 thick
00:01:28.500 otherwise
00:01:28.710 you're
00:01:29.070 just
00:01:29.100 eating
00:01:29.310 a

00:01:29.460 small
00:01:29.729 thick
00:01:30.090 burger
00:01:30.299 if
00:01:30.869 you
00:01:30.930 like
00:01:31.110 it
00:01:31.229 that

00:01:31.350 way
00:01:31.500 go
00:01:31.950 with
00:01:32.100 it
00:01:32.250 but
00:01:32.490 just
00:01:32.670 for
00:01:33.000 sliders
00:01:33.240 so

00:01:33.990 here
00:01:34.140 we
00:01:34.229 go
00:01:34.670 take
00:01:35.670 a
00:01:35.700 knife
00:01:35.970 and
00:01:36.210 just
00:01:36.590 start

00:01:37.590 taking
00:01:37.740 the
00:01:37.979 edges
00:01:38.280 like
00:01:38.400 that
00:01:38.509 now
00:01:39.509 you
00:01:39.570 can

00:01:39.750 use
00:01:39.780 the
00:01:39.960 extra
00:01:40.320 meat
00:01:40.560 to
00:01:41.009 go
00:01:41.310 ahead
00:01:41.430 and

00:01:41.700 reform
00:01:42.119 it
00:01:42.240 out
00:01:42.329 and
00:01:42.479 make
00:01:42.570 more
00:01:42.750 patties
00:01:43.140 so

00:01:43.380 don't
00:01:43.590 think
00:01:43.860 that
00:01:43.979 you're
00:01:44.159 wasting
00:01:44.670 any
00:01:45.030 meat

00:01:45.270 and
00:01:46.110 as
00:01:46.229 you
00:01:46.350 go
00:01:46.500 along
00:01:46.909 gently
00:01:47.909 use
00:01:48.119 your

00:01:48.149 knife
00:01:49.130 start
00:01:50.130 cutting
00:01:50.399 the
00:01:50.520 edges
00:01:50.880 and
00:01:51.329 moving

00:01:51.689 it
00:01:51.780 inside
00:01:53.119 all
00:01:54.119 right
00:01:54.240 I'm
00:01:54.360 gonna
00:01:54.450 fish
00:01:54.720 this

00:01:54.930 and
00:01:55.140 I'll
00:01:55.200 get
00:01:55.350 back
00:01:55.380 to
00:01:55.680 you
00:01:55.740 in
00:01:55.799 a
00:01:55.829 moment
00:01:55.950 and

00:01:58.219 here's
00:01:59.219 a
00:01:59.310 basic
00:01:59.729 idea
00:01:59.880 of
00:02:00.210 what
00:02:00.360 it
00:02:00.450 looks

00:02:00.630 like
00:02:00.840 just
00:02:01.549 simple
00:02:02.549 square
00:02:02.729 patties
00:02:03.149 you
00:02:03.180 can

00:02:03.450 salt
00:02:03.719 them
00:02:03.899 now
00:02:04.079 I
00:02:04.439 prefer
00:02:04.950 to
00:02:05.189 salt
00:02:05.430 them

00:02:05.610 after
00:02:05.969 they
00:02:06.090 come
00:02:06.270 off
00:02:06.450 just
00:02:06.890 because
00:02:07.890 it's

00:02:08.789 all
00:02:08.940 usually
00:02:09.090 falls
00:02:09.509 off

00:02:10.970 so
00:02:11.270 now
00:02:11.390 you
00:02:11.540 want
00:02:11.690 to
00:02:11.720 just
00:02:11.930 toast
00:02:12.140 those

00:02:12.410 buttons
00:02:12.740 put
00:02:12.950 them
00:02:13.040 under
00:02:13.250 your
00:02:13.310 broiler
00:02:13.580 for

00:02:13.970 like
00:02:14.150 thirty
00:02:14.480 Seconds
00:02:14.930 to
00:02:14.960 a
00:02:15.080 minute

00:02:15.170 depending
00:02:15.910 on
00:02:16.910 how
00:02:17.150 high
00:02:17.360 have
00:02:17.570 the
00:02:17.690 rack
00:02:17.870 and

00:02:18.200 how
00:02:18.790 strong
00:02:19.790 your
00:02:19.970 broiler
00:02:20.150 is
00:02:20.450 but
00:02:20.600 look
00:02:20.720 how

00:02:20.840 beautiful
00:02:20.960 alright
00:02:21.650 so
00:02:21.890 we
00:02:22.010 got
00:02:22.160 the
00:02:22.340 burgers

00:02:22.820 ready
00:02:23.060 let's
00:02:23.480 put
00:02:23.660 them
00:02:23.750 on
00:02:23.900 the
00:02:24.140 pan
00:02:25.070 here

00:02:56.740 yummy
00:02:57.740 there
00:02:58.310 you
00:02:58.430 go
00:02:59.230 there's
00:03:00.230 your
00:03:00.320 sliders

00:03:00.860 let's
00:03:01.310 finish
00:03:01.490 them
00:03:01.700 off
00:03:01.940 really
00:03:02.750 quick
