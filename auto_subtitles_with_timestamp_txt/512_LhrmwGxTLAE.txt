00:03:31.180 slowly
00:03:31.690 the
00:03:31.989 water
00:03:32.200 and
00:03:32.500 now
00:03:33.220 we're

00:03:40.450 starts
00:03:40.959 forming
00:03:41.230 a
00:03:41.709 dough

00:03:42.040 with
00:03:42.430 the
00:03:42.459 water
00:03:42.940 that
00:03:43.599 you
00:03:43.750 can
00:03:43.930 see
00:03:44.139 a
00:03:44.169 ball

00:03:44.769 going
00:03:45.250 around
00:03:45.639 in
00:03:45.849 your
00:03:45.879 food
00:03:46.299 processor
00:03:46.349 that

00:03:52.840 cup
00:03:53.049 but
00:03:53.650 every

00:03:54.069 time
00:03:54.220 flower
00:03:54.519 is
00:03:54.700 different
00:03:55.090 so
00:03:55.239 it
00:03:55.359 can
00:03:55.510 vary

00:03:55.720 kindy
00:03:56.079 one
00:03:56.260 captain
00:03:56.620 can
00:03:56.769 be
00:03:56.889 more

00:03:57.489 a
00:03:57.519 cap

00:03:57.790 and

00:06:08.740 sometimes
00:06:09.740 if
