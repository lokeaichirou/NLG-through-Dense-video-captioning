00:01:02.920 what
00:01:03.579 I'm

00:01:03.670 going
00:01:03.789 to

00:01:09.009 I'm
00:01:09.100 actually
00:01:09.280 going
00:01:09.609 to
00:01:09.700 do
00:01:09.939 and
00:01:10.420 this

00:01:10.810 might
00:01:10.990 sound
00:01:11.200 a
00:01:11.320 little
00:01:11.350 bit
00:01:11.619 odd
00:01:11.859 I'm
00:01:12.490 going

00:01:12.759 to
00:01:12.850 take
00:01:13.060 my
00:01:13.210 family
00:01:13.479 slice
00:01:13.899 banacheck
00:01:14.140 that

00:01:14.560 I'm
00:01:14.680 just
00:01:14.890 going
00:01:15.039 to
00:01:15.070 grill
00:01:15.340 it
00:01:15.490 for
00:01:15.700 a
00:01:15.729 couple

00:01:15.909 minutes
00:01:16.180 on
00:01:16.420 each
00:01:16.570 side
00:01:16.600 to
00:01:17.320 develop
00:01:17.710 its

00:01:17.829 flavor
00:01:18.189 and
00:01:18.369 a
00:01:18.520 little
00:01:18.850 bit
00:01:18.939 of
00:01:19.030 texture
00:01:19.329 and

00:01:20.020 that's
00:01:20.079 all
00:01:20.259 I'm
00:01:20.350 going
00:01:20.469 to
00:01:20.560 do
00:01:20.649 for
00:01:20.829 now
00:01:20.859 and

00:01:21.159 it's
00:01:21.369 going
00:01:21.490 to
00:01:21.579 take
00:01:21.700 no
00:01:22.329 time
00:01:22.600 at
00:01:22.719 all
00:01:22.810 it

00:01:22.990 takes
00:01:23.200 just
00:01:23.530 about
00:01:23.770 a
00:01:23.829 minute
00:01:24.100 per
00:01:24.219 side
00:01:25.259 so
00:01:26.259 go

00:01:26.439 ahead
00:01:26.530 and
00:01:26.829 do
00:01:26.979 that
00:01:28.170 take
00:01:29.170 my
00:01:29.350 last
00:01:29.590 chip

00:01:29.890 pieces
00:01:30.249 off
00:01:30.429 and
00:01:30.820 it
00:01:30.909 literally
00:01:31.359 takes
00:01:31.570 just

00:01:31.840 about
00:01:32.020 a
00:01:32.079 minute
00:01:32.499 or
00:01:32.799 so
00:01:33.039 total
00:01:33.640 doesn't
00:01:34.630 take

00:01:34.719 any
00:01:34.869 time
00:01:34.929 at
00:01:35.049 all
00:01:35.170 but
00:01:35.320 it
00:01:35.380 really
00:01:35.530 develops

00:01:35.979 the
00:01:36.100 flavor
00:01:36.340 so
00:01:36.549 it's
00:01:36.700 a
00:01:36.759 really
00:01:37.030 important

00:01:37.359 step
00:01:37.570 that
00:01:37.600 I
00:01:37.780 wouldn't
00:01:38.020 skip
00:01:38.289 but
00:01:38.799 of
00:01:38.859 course

00:01:39.070 if
00:01:39.219 you
00:01:39.249 don't
00:01:39.429 have
00:01:39.520 punch
00:01:39.729 I
00:01:39.880 thought
00:01:40.090 which

00:01:40.240 is
00:01:40.420 really
00:01:40.840 the
00:01:41.079 Italian
00:01:41.469 version
00:01:41.590 of
00:01:41.829 bacon

00:01:42.219 then
00:01:42.249 you
00:01:42.490 can
00:01:42.640 just
00:01:42.880 use
00:01:43.030 bacon
00:01:43.450 so
00:01:44.229 onto

00:01:44.759 assembling
00:01:45.759 our
00:01:46.409 sandwiches
00:01:47.409 now
00:01:47.920 what
00:01:48.130 I
00:01:48.159 do

00:01:48.249 is
00:01:48.700 take
00:01:49.479 couple
00:01:50.200 slices
00:01:50.380 of
00:01:50.560 good
00:01:50.829 quality

00:01:51.249 bread
00:01:51.490 and
00:01:51.729 I
00:01:51.789 like
00:01:51.909 to
00:01:52.030 use
00:01:52.060 a
00:01:52.359 whole
00:01:52.630 grain

00:01:52.899 bread
00:01:53.109 because
00:01:53.380 I
00:01:53.409 always
00:01:53.679 have
00:01:53.979 whole-grain

00:01:54.670 on
00:01:55.030 hand
00:01:55.450 that's
00:01:56.289 my
00:01:56.560 bread
00:01:56.859 of
00:01:57.009 choice
00:01:57.310 and
00:01:58.119 I

00:01:58.270 like
00:01:58.509 to
00:01:58.659 spread
00:01:58.990 a
00:01:59.259 thin
00:01:59.770 thin
00:02:00.219 slice
00:02:00.759 but
00:02:01.179 I

00:02:01.210 have
00:02:01.479 to
00:02:01.780 a
00:02:01.810 one
00:02:02.049 teaspoon
00:02:02.619 per
00:02:02.649 slice
00:02:03.219 of

00:02:03.659 pesto
00:02:04.659 now
00:02:05.079 the
00:02:05.139 reason
00:02:05.439 why
00:02:05.590 I'm
00:02:05.710 using
00:02:05.740 pesto

00:02:06.460 is

00:02:07.420 we
00:02:07.600 use
00:02:07.630 Mayo
00:02:08.440 but

00:02:09.009 you
00:02:10.000 know
00:02:10.119 males
00:02:10.569 not
00:02:10.750 that
00:02:10.899 figure
00:02:11.170 friendly

00:02:11.590 and
00:02:11.830 I'm
00:02:11.890 not
00:02:12.250 a
00:02:12.280 huge

00:02:13.100 of
00:02:13.490 Mayor
00:02:13.730 on
00:02:14.030 my
00:02:14.180 sandwiches
00:02:14.720 but
00:02:14.930 if
00:02:15.080 you

00:02:15.230 like
00:02:15.530 may
00:02:15.770 open
00:02:16.130 by

00:02:18.650 going
00:02:18.770 to
00:02:18.830 do
00:02:18.980 is
00:02:19.100 just

00:02:19.220 spread
00:02:19.490 thin
00:02:20.000 slats
00:02:20.450 smear
00:02:21.080 of
00:02:21.580 basil
00:02:22.580 pesto

00:02:22.790 onto
00:02:23.720 each
00:02:23.870 slice
00:02:26.500 last
00:02:27.500 one
00:02:28.090 okay
00:02:29.090 now
00:02:29.240 here's

00:02:29.570 how
00:02:29.780 she
00:02:29.810 goes
00:02:30.580 now
00:02:31.580 I'm
00:02:31.670 going
00:02:31.880 to
00:02:31.940 put
00:02:32.030 a

00:02:32.060 little
00:02:32.570 bit
00:02:32.660 of
00:02:32.750 the
00:02:32.840 shredded
00:02:33.170 cheese

00:02:33.410 underneath
00:02:34.180 pretty
00:02:35.180 much
00:02:35.330 everything
00:02:35.930 so

00:02:36.490 first
00:02:37.490 slice
00:02:37.790 is
00:02:37.970 going
00:02:38.120 to
00:02:38.180 get
00:02:38.300 a
00:02:38.330 little
00:02:38.570 bit

00:02:38.660 of
00:02:38.750 cheese
00:02:38.960 and
00:02:39.320 this
00:02:39.530 is
00:02:39.680 one
00:02:39.800 with
00:02:39.890 the

00:02:39.950 topper
00:02:40.370 so
00:02:40.490 don't
00:02:40.670 worry
00:02:40.820 about
00:02:40.910 those
00:02:41.120 two

00:02:41.180 slices
00:02:41.810 just
00:02:42.110 yet
00:02:42.560 and
00:02:42.890 the
00:02:43.310 reason
00:02:43.580 I'm

00:02:43.670 putting
00:02:43.760 cheese
00:02:44.300 on
00:02:44.330 the
00:02:44.900 first
00:02:45.110 slice
00:02:45.320 and
00:02:45.530 as

00:02:45.890 well
00:02:46.040 as
00:02:46.160 a
00:02:46.190 tap
00:02:46.520 it's
00:02:46.820 because
00:02:47.090 it's
00:02:47.240 going
00:02:47.360 to

00:02:47.420 act
00:02:47.660 like
00:02:48.020 glue
00:02:48.230 it's
00:02:49.040 going
00:02:49.160 to
00:02:49.220 kind
00:02:49.400 of

00:02:49.460 stick
00:02:49.730 everything
00:02:50.330 together
00:02:50.450 so
00:02:50.900 that's
00:02:51.020 you

00:02:51.860 know
00:02:51.890 that's
00:02:52.220 why
00:02:52.430 I'm
00:02:52.550 using
00:02:52.700 me
00:02:52.910 that
00:02:53.060 way

00:02:53.180 then
00:02:53.930 going
00:02:54.560 to
00:02:54.590 pile
00:02:55.010 on
00:02:55.490 the
00:02:56.420 tomatoes
00:02:57.640 you

00:02:58.640 can
00:02:58.910 just
00:02:59.150 use
00:02:59.510 whatever
00:03:00.020 you
00:03:00.830 want

00:03:02.890 just
00:03:03.890 seasoning
00:03:04.280 the
00:03:04.370 tomatoes
00:03:04.760 a
00:03:04.820 little
00:03:04.850 bit

00:03:05.360 with
00:03:05.510 some
00:03:05.660 pepper
00:03:05.870 you
00:03:06.170 do
00:03:06.350 not
00:03:06.500 need
00:03:06.680 any

00:03:06.980 salt
00:03:07.370 because
00:03:07.460 pancetta
00:03:08.120 is
00:03:08.300 so
00:03:08.630 salty
00:03:09.350 it

00:03:09.890 will
00:03:10.130 be
00:03:10.250 so
00:03:10.460 overpowering
00:03:11.090 and
00:03:11.300 then
00:03:11.450 you'll

00:03:11.600 be
00:03:11.720 completely
00:03:12.670 regretting
00:03:13.670 that
00:03:13.820 move
00:03:14.030 so

00:03:14.960 just
00:03:15.200 pile
00:03:15.410 on
00:03:15.440 your
00:03:15.830 punch
00:03:16.010 I
00:03:16.160 thumb

00:03:16.630 it's
00:03:17.630 so
00:03:17.960 thinly
00:03:18.320 sliced
00:03:18.830 it's
00:03:19.130 going
00:03:19.250 to
00:03:19.310 be

00:03:19.430 amazing
00:03:19.670 I
00:03:20.090 don't
00:03:20.180 like
00:03:20.480 to
00:03:20.660 have
00:03:20.840 like
00:03:21.080 too

00:03:21.380 thick
00:03:21.740 of
00:03:22.060 a
00:03:23.060 piece
00:03:23.300 of
00:03:23.570 bacon
00:03:23.990 or
00:03:24.110 pancetta
00:03:24.320 in

00:03:24.650 my
00:03:24.710 mouth
00:03:24.920 because
00:03:25.040 I
00:03:25.160 think
00:03:25.340 it's
00:03:25.490 too

00:03:25.940 overpowering
00:03:26.600 and
00:03:26.870 just
00:03:27.110 nothing
00:03:27.620 you
00:03:27.770 can

00:03:28.040 taste
00:03:28.190 anything
00:03:28.550 else
00:03:28.850 if
00:03:29.060 you
00:03:29.090 do
00:03:29.330 that
00:03:29.480 a

00:03:29.720 couple
00:03:30.470 slices
00:03:30.650 of
00:03:30.830 bacon
00:03:31.070 bacon
00:03:32.000 of
00:03:32.270 basil

00:03:32.900 and
00:03:33.670 then
00:03:34.670 I'm
00:03:34.820 just
00:03:35.030 going
00:03:35.180 to
00:03:35.210 put
00:03:35.390 on
00:03:35.480 a

00:03:35.690 handful
00:03:36.350 of
00:03:36.400 some
00:03:37.400 fresh
00:03:37.960 clean
00:03:38.960 baby
00:03:39.530 spinach

00:03:39.980 that's
00:03:40.970 great
00:03:42.880 so
00:03:44.350 last
00:03:45.350 thing
00:03:45.650 whoops

00:03:46.370 losing

00:03:47.090 bit
00:03:47.270 my
00:03:47.510 spinach
00:03:48.730 last
00:03:49.730 thing

00:03:51.860 cheese

00:03:52.340 on
00:03:52.760 top
00:03:54.010 because
00:03:55.010 this
00:03:55.160 is
00:03:55.280 a
00:03:55.310 top
00:03:55.580 layer
00:03:55.850 so

00:03:55.880 it's
