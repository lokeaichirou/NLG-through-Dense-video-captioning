00:00:51.210 as
00:00:51.329 small
00:00:51.690 as
00:00:52.020 you
00:00:52.410 would

00:00:52.649 with
00:00:53.399 you
00:00:54.590 making
00:00:55.590 boom
00:00:56.190 and
00:00:56.550 I'm
00:00:56.820 sure
00:00:57.360 you

00:00:57.510 pick
00:00:57.930 up
00:00:58.230 this
00:00:58.440 a
00:00:58.649 bully
00:00:59.219 so
00:00:59.789 the
00:01:00.780 desmics
00:01:01.289 like

00:01:02.359 the
00:01:03.359 limit
00:01:03.690 of
00:01:03.840 what
00:01:03.989 I'm
00:01:04.110 going
00:01:04.260 to
00:01:04.320 get
00:01:04.470 out

00:01:04.619 of
00:01:04.650 this
00:01:04.890 heart
00:01:05.220 of
00:01:05.339 Romania
00:01:17.150 in
00:01:18.150 addition
00:01:18.420 for

00:01:18.869 the
00:01:18.930 romaine
00:01:19.290 lettuce
00:01:24.979 cucumber

00:01:31.909 green
00:01:32.659 pepper
00:01:33.759 so
00:01:34.759 the
00:01:35.090 suggestion
00:01:35.509 for
00:01:35.810 the

00:01:35.899 recipe
00:01:36.229 was
00:01:36.469 green
00:01:36.740 pepper
00:01:37.009 and
00:01:37.130 red
00:01:37.340 pepper

00:01:37.609 but
00:01:37.969 red
00:01:38.569 peppers
00:01:39.079 so
00:01:39.380 incredibly
00:01:40.159 expensive

00:01:40.549 than
00:01:40.880 I
00:01:40.909 refuse
00:01:41.329 to
00:01:41.479 use
00:01:41.719 it
00:01:44.799 chopped
00:01:45.799 parsley

00:01:46.280 chopped
00:01:47.060 fairly
00:01:47.509 fine
00:01:56.770 small
00:01:57.770 chopped
00:01:58.490 onion

00:02:05.049 chopped
00:02:06.049 green
00:02:06.709 onion
00:02:07.129 and
00:02:15.640 finely
00:02:16.640 chopped

00:02:16.910 myth
00:02:17.209 about
00:02:17.750 two
00:02:18.049 tablespoons
00:02:21.129 I'm
00:02:22.129 also

00:02:22.340 using
00:02:22.549 tomato
00:02:26.170 and
00:02:28.060 since
00:02:29.060 I
00:02:29.180 live
00:02:29.359 in
00:02:29.450 America

00:02:29.900 and
00:02:30.019 it's
00:02:30.200 impossible
00:02:30.829 to
00:02:30.859 get
00:02:31.129 fresh
00:02:32.739 tasty

00:02:33.739 tomatoes
00:02:34.609 i'm
00:02:35.299 using
00:02:35.769 i'm
00:02:36.769 using
00:02:37.900 canned

00:02:38.900 tomato
00:02:39.700 which
00:02:40.700 has
00:02:41.060 been
00:02:41.359 through
00:02:41.900 throughout

00:02:42.349 the
00:02:42.680 tomato
00:02:43.040 juice
00:02:43.340 and
00:02:43.579 actually
00:02:44.569 rinsed
00:02:45.079 the

00:02:45.470 pieces
00:02:45.859 of
00:02:46.010 tomatoes
00:02:46.489 so
00:02:46.819 that
00:02:47.290 the
00:02:48.290 tomato

00:02:49.130 juice
00:02:49.849 wouldn't
00:02:50.209 interfere
00:02:50.450 with
00:02:50.810 the

00:02:51.019 dressing
00:02:51.500 that
00:02:51.650 i'm
00:02:51.829 going
00:02:52.010 to
00:02:52.130 make
00:02:53.799 so
00:02:54.799 i
00:02:54.829 had

00:02:54.980 two
00:02:55.310 tomatoes

00:03:04.560 and
00:03:05.820 because
00:03:06.820 somebody
00:03:07.480 was
00:03:07.780 kind
00:03:08.200 enough
00:03:08.380 to

00:03:08.890 leave
00:03:09.100 a
00:03:09.370 little
00:03:09.520 bit
00:03:09.760 of
00:03:09.790 a
00:03:10.030 cheese
00:03:10.390 i'm
00:03:11.020 going

00:03:11.260 to
00:03:11.320 add
00:03:11.440 that
00:03:11.680 to
00:03:18.270 this
00:03:19.270 is
00:03:19.420 the
00:03:19.540 part
00:03:19.780 that

00:03:19.810 really
00:03:20.170 looking
00:03:20.680 forward
00:03:21.040 to
00:03:21.220 I'm
00:03:21.700 gonna
00:03:21.850 mix

00:03:22.120 it
00:03:22.330 up

00:03:47.010 there
00:03:47.670 it
00:03:47.760 is
00:03:47.909 looks
00:03:48.750 pretty
00:03:48.930 good
00:03:49.170 to
00:03:49.349 me

00:03:57.460 now
00:03:58.460 for
00:03:58.700 the
00:03:58.790 dressing
00:03:59.500 I'm
00:04:00.500 going
00:04:00.770 to
00:04:00.830 be
00:04:00.950 a

00:04:00.980 little
00:04:01.250 bit
00:04:01.490 daring
00:04:01.940 because
00:04:02.660 let's
00:04:02.930 face
00:04:03.020 it

00:04:03.320 i
00:04:03.410 don't
00:04:03.590 know
00:04:03.830 much
00:04:04.100 about
00:04:04.280 making
00:04:04.760 dressing

00:04:07.420 and
00:04:08.420 I
00:04:08.570 want
00:04:08.810 to
00:04:08.930 have
00:04:09.110 enough
00:04:09.700 so
00:04:10.700 that
00:04:11.090 I

00:04:11.690 don't
00:04:11.960 have
00:04:12.170 to
00:04:12.320 make
00:04:12.650 make
00:04:13.490 any
00:04:13.640 more
00:04:14.710 before

00:04:15.710 the
00:04:15.830 salad
00:04:16.250 is
00:04:16.370 going
00:04:16.700 so
00:04:16.940 I'm
00:04:17.030 going
00:04:17.210 to
00:04:17.239 put

00:04:17.330 in
00:04:17.630 what
00:04:17.840 I
00:04:17.870 think
00:04:18.260 is
00:04:18.380 about
00:04:18.650 the
00:04:18.920 juice
00:04:19.220 of

00:04:19.720 three
00:04:20.720 lemons

00:04:35.580 maybe
00:04:36.580 four

00:04:39.990 maybe
00:04:40.590 four
00:04:41.840 then
00:04:42.840 let's
00:04:43.260 see
00:04:43.440 what
00:04:43.620 next
00:04:44.040 I

00:04:44.250 think
00:04:44.640 I
00:04:44.790 probably
00:04:45.200 within
00:04:46.200 a
00:04:46.790 teaspoon
00:04:47.790 or

00:04:47.910 two
00:04:48.210 of
00:04:48.540 garlic
00:05:06.800 then
00:05:07.800 I'm
00:05:08.280 going
00:05:08.730 to
00:05:08.790 add
00:05:09.330 some

00:05:12.590 regular
00:05:13.590 mustard

00:05:26.050 perhaps
00:05:31.960 teaspoon
00:05:32.960 of
00:05:33.110 black
00:05:33.320 pepper
00:05:33.380 a

00:05:41.590 little
00:05:42.590 bit
00:05:42.919 of
00:05:43.010 white
00:05:43.190 pepper
00:05:43.220 too
00:05:43.880 I
00:05:45.280 get
00:05:46.280 in

00:05:46.370 between
00:05:46.550 the
00:05:46.850 black
00:05:47.090 pepper

00:05:57.969 and
00:05:58.869 I
00:05:58.959 have
00:05:59.139 a
00:05:59.169 sense
00:05:59.559 from
00:06:00.069 reading
00:06:00.579 several

00:06:00.939 recipes
00:06:02.039 there
00:06:03.039 should
00:06:03.249 be
00:06:03.369 some
00:06:03.610 sweetness

00:06:04.349 i'm
00:06:05.349 going
00:06:05.559 to
00:06:05.619 try
00:06:05.889 a
00:06:06.009 little
00:06:06.669 bit
00:06:07.319 maple

00:06:08.319 syrup
00:06:09.219 but
00:06:09.459 not
00:06:09.669 very
00:06:09.939 much
00:06:14.849 because
00:06:15.849 there's

00:06:16.449 no
00:06:16.719 disguising
00:06:17.409 maple
00:06:18.099 syrup
00:06:18.369 if
00:06:18.579 you
00:06:18.699 get
00:06:18.879 too

00:06:19.059 much
00:06:19.089 in

00:06:25.950 much
00:06:26.950 there
00:06:28.110 but
00:06:29.110 if
00:06:29.200 it
00:06:29.320 is
00:06:29.440 I'll
00:06:29.860 probably

00:06:30.130 add
00:06:31.890 and
00:06:32.890 the
00:06:33.670 rest
00:06:34.770 would
00:06:35.770 probably
00:06:36.430 be
00:06:37.740 extra

00:06:38.740 virgin
00:06:38.950 olive
00:06:39.280 oil

00:06:53.820 put
00:06:54.820 it
00:06:54.940 into
00:06:55.270 this
00:06:55.770 clean
00:06:56.770 jars

00:07:34.710 that
00:07:35.710 looks
00:07:35.950 pretty
00:07:36.100 good
00:07:39.210 one
00:07:40.210 of
00:07:40.330 the
00:07:40.420 best

00:07:40.660 things
00:07:40.780 about
00:07:41.410 this
00:07:41.890 salad
00:07:42.540 aside
00:07:43.540 from
00:07:43.690 the

00:07:43.900 obvious
00:07:43.930 health
00:07:44.580 benefits
00:08:02.790 is
00:08:03.960 that
00:08:06.030 sir
00:08:07.620 pita

00:08:08.620 chips
00:08:10.080 which
00:08:11.080 could
00:08:11.770 be
00:08:11.950 homemade
00:08:12.640 but
00:08:13.000 I'm

00:08:13.380 way
00:08:14.380 to
00:08:14.440 do
00:08:14.920 that
00:08:15.130 I
00:08:15.430 need
00:08:16.270 to
00:08:16.600 shake
00:08:16.840 this

00:08:17.050 dressing
00:08:17.380 up
00:08:17.650 a
00:08:17.740 little
00:08:17.980 bit
00:08:28.020 so
00:08:29.020 here
00:08:29.260 it
00:08:29.350 is

00:08:30.000 that
00:08:31.000 touch√©
00:08:31.480 salad
00:08:32.550 with
00:08:33.550 mustard
00:08:33.940 and
00:08:34.450 maple

00:08:34.960 syrup
00:08:35.200 dressing

00:08:45.570 which
00:08:46.570 is
00:08:46.750 my
00:08:46.960 favorite
00:08:47.530 part
00:09:01.650 not
00:09:02.650 homemade

00:09:06.930 but
00:09:08.760 extremely
00:09:09.760 interesting
