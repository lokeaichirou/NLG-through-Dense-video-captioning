00:03:56.780 really
00:03:56.990 salty
00:03:57.290 some
00:03:58.040 people
00:03:58.310 don't
00:03:58.460 like

00:03:58.550 it
00:03:58.610 they're
00:03:58.880 salty
00:03:59.270 it
00:03:59.480 all
00:03:59.600 depends
00:04:00.110 on
00:04:00.170 how

00:04:00.380 you
00:04:00.440 like
00:04:00.920 it
00:04:00.950 and
00:04:01.760 then
00:04:01.850 we're
00:04:01.940 going
00:04:02.030 to
00:04:02.090 mix

00:04:02.300 this
00:04:02.450 up
00:04:02.630 really

00:04:07.640 the

00:04:07.820 seasoning

00:04:09.140 want
00:04:09.320 to
00:04:09.410 check
00:04:09.560 the
00:04:09.620 dough's

00:04:09.950 consistency
00:04:10.850 this
00:04:11.270 is
00:04:11.480 a
00:04:11.690 lot
00:04:11.960 like
00:04:12.200 a
00:04:12.230 dough

00:04:12.530 and
00:04:13.810 if
00:04:14.810 you
00:04:14.960 see
00:04:15.230 that
00:04:16.010 it's
00:04:16.220 too
00:04:16.489 crumbly

00:04:17.000 what
00:04:17.780 you
00:04:17.900 can
00:04:18.080 do
00:04:18.230 as
00:04:18.530 a
00:04:18.560 fix-it
00:04:19.280 is

00:04:26.810 add
00:04:26.930 too
00:04:27.230 much
00:04:27.410 because
00:04:27.680 you

00:04:28.190 want
00:04:28.340 it

00:04:28.580 be
00:04:28.730 too
00:04:29.360 doughy
00:04:29.810 and
00:04:30.200 then

00:04:30.950 stay
00:04:31.130 raw

00:04:31.460 in

00:04:41.900 it
00:04:42.140 falafel
00:04:43.130 can

00:06:12.500 it
00:06:12.770 you

00:06:12.889 don't
00:06:13.069 want
00:06:13.219 to
00:06:13.310 burn
00:06:13.460 yourself
00:06:13.909 have

00:06:14.900 on
00:06:15.289 medium
00:06:15.680 heat

00:06:27.589 pan

00:06:32.199 now
00:06:32.740 you
00:06:32.830 want
00:06:33.219 to
00:06:33.340 let
00:06:33.490 them
00:06:33.639 cook
00:06:33.879 until

00:06:34.599 they're

00:06:34.990 medium
00:06:35.590 golden
00:06:36.189 brown
00:06:36.520 you

00:06:36.909 don't

00:06:40.539 medium
00:06:40.810 low

00:06:41.199 heat

00:06:42.430 they'll
00:06:42.969 be
00:06:43.029 nice

00:06:46.840 want
