00:02:26.370 in
00:02:26.670 your
00:02:26.970 pasta
00:02:27.599 and
00:02:27.750 again
00:02:28.319 this
00:02:28.470 should

00:02:28.620 be
00:02:28.739 slightly
00:02:29.129 undercooked
00:02:29.670 so
00:02:30.120 that
00:02:30.239 way
00:02:30.360 when

00:02:30.510 you
00:02:30.569 add
00:02:30.750 it
00:02:30.870 into
00:02:31.019 your
00:02:31.170 really
00:02:31.500 hot
00:02:31.709 soup
00:02:32.040 it

00:02:32.489 cooks
00:02:32.760 it
00:02:32.909 just
00:02:33.090 a
00:02:33.180 little
00:02:33.299 bit
00:02:33.420 more
00:02:33.659 but
00:02:33.870 it

00:02:33.959 doesn't
00:02:34.260 get
00:02:34.349 the
00:02:34.470 pasta
00:02:34.829 to
00:02:35.040 soggy
00:02:35.400 so
00:02:36.180 just

00:02:36.450 stir
00:02:36.810 it
00:02:36.840 up
00:02:37.110 until
00:02:37.319 it's
00:02:37.890 nice
00:02:38.129 and
00:02:38.190 mixed
00:02:43.250 so

00:02:44.250 there
00:02:44.459 you
00:02:44.579 have
00:02:44.610 it
00:02:44.849 a
00:02:45.120 nice
00:02:45.450 huge
00:02:46.049 pot
00:02:46.500 of

00:02:46.530 pasta
00:02:46.890 e
00:02:47.129 fagioli
00:02:47.370 I'm
00:02:47.940 not
00:02:48.690 trying
00:02:49.109 to
00:02:49.290 brag

00:02:49.530 or
00:02:49.739 anything
00:02:49.769 but
00:02:50.220 I
00:02:50.640 do
00:02:50.700 think
00:02:51.269 that
00:02:51.450 this

00:02:51.629 recipe
00:02:52.049 is
00:02:52.290 actually

00:02:53.370 than
00:02:53.640 Olive
00:02:53.940 Garden's
