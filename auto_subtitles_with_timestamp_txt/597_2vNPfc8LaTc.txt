00:00:26.010 to
00:00:26.070 pull
00:00:26.279 the
00:00:26.400 other

00:00:26.550 sides
00:00:26.880 I'm
00:00:27.150 just
00:00:27.449 using
00:00:27.840 a
00:00:28.050 v-formation
00:00:28.560 for

00:00:29.099 each
00:00:29.160 of

00:00:29.429 strips
00:00:29.789 you're

00:00:35.130 is
00:00:35.190 line

00:00:39.270 just
00:00:39.480 makes
00:00:39.660 a
