00:00:58.230 also
00:00:58.260 a
00:00:58.890 lot
00:00:59.820 of
00:00:59.879 times
00:01:00.000 it

00:01:00.090 guarantees

00:01:29.770 use
00:01:30.010 any

00:01:30.310 spices
00:01:30.610 we're
00:01:31.270 gonna
00:01:31.360 use
00:01:31.480 caraway
00:01:31.930 because

00:01:32.260 it
00:01:32.410 is
00:01:32.500 a
00:01:32.530 really
00:01:33.160 traditional
00:01:33.450 sauerkraut

00:01:34.450 spice
00:01:34.780 and
00:01:35.200 then
00:01:35.830 we're
00:01:36.070 going
00:01:36.160 to
00:01:36.220 add
00:01:36.430 salt

00:01:37.390 I
00:01:37.420 know
00:01:38.080 salt
00:01:38.350 is
00:01:38.500 important
00:01:38.950 you
00:01:39.220 want
00:01:39.370 to

00:01:39.430 make
00:01:39.550 sure
00:01:39.580 that
00:01:39.940 you
00:01:40.030 are
00:01:40.180 using
00:01:40.540 a

00:01:41.010 non-iodized
00:01:42.010 sea
00:01:42.490 salt
00:01:42.760 right
00:01:43.030 iodine
00:01:43.960 is
00:01:44.080 a

00:01:44.110 disinfectant
00:01:44.770 we
00:01:44.860 don't
00:01:45.130 want
00:01:45.310 to
00:01:45.370 use
00:01:45.490 that

00:01:45.729 in
00:01:45.880 here
00:01:46.090 so
00:01:46.420 I
00:01:46.450 have
00:01:46.540 Celtic
00:01:46.900 sea
00:01:47.110 salt
00:01:47.140 here

00:01:47.530 but
00:01:47.650 you
00:01:47.710 can
00:01:47.830 use
00:01:47.950 like
00:01:48.100 the
00:01:48.130 Himalayan
00:01:48.610 pink

00:01:48.820 sea
00:01:49.090 salt
00:01:49.300 you
00:01:50.200 can
00:01:50.320 use
00:01:50.440 any
00:01:50.710 of
00:01:50.830 these
00:01:51.070 and

00:01:51.310 we're
00:01:51.430 going
00:01:51.550 to
00:01:51.580 add
00:01:51.760 for
00:01:52.720 this
00:01:52.840 but
00:01:53.050 we're

00:01:53.560 probably
00:01:53.650 just
00:01:53.860 going
00:01:54.070 to
00:01:54.130 add
00:01:54.250 about
00:01:54.580 a

00:01:55.030 tablespoon
00:01:55.690 or
00:01:56.200 so
00:01:56.700 generally
00:01:57.700 the
00:01:57.910 rule
00:01:58.090 is

00:01:58.390 three
00:01:59.080 to
00:01:59.170 four
00:01:59.320 tablespoons
00:01:59.500 per

00:02:00.460 of

00:02:01.330 sauerkraut
00:02:01.800 okay
00:02:02.800 so
00:02:02.860 that's
00:02:03.640 a
00:02:03.759 gallon
00:02:04.270 with

00:02:04.420 it
00:02:04.509 all
00:02:04.660 packed

00:02:06.610 quart
00:02:07.090 today
00:02:07.390 so
00:02:07.600 we're
00:02:07.720 going
00:02:07.810 to
00:02:07.869 fill
00:02:08.080 it

00:02:08.170 up
00:02:08.259 into
00:02:08.440 here
00:02:08.830 this
00:02:09.009 is
00:02:09.100 about
00:02:09.220 a
00:02:09.250 quart
00:02:09.670 so
00:02:10.509 we

00:02:10.600 want
00:02:10.750 to
00:02:10.810 use
00:02:10.989 I'm
00:02:11.530 saying
00:02:11.770 like
00:02:11.890 one

00:02:12.160 tablespoon
00:02:12.820 one
00:02:13.030 and
00:02:13.120 a
00:02:13.150 half
00:02:13.239 tablespoons

00:02:13.780 you
00:02:14.560 want
00:02:14.770 it
00:02:14.860 to
00:02:14.950 taste
00:02:15.190 as
00:02:15.370 salty
00:02:15.760 as
00:02:15.790 a
00:02:15.970 Lay's

00:02:16.270 potato
00:02:16.300 chip
00:02:16.959 and
00:02:17.380 so
00:02:17.950 you
00:02:18.040 just
00:02:18.130 want
00:02:18.340 to
00:02:18.370 mix

00:02:18.580 it
00:02:18.760 and
00:02:18.910 you're
00:02:19.000 really
00:02:19.239 just
00:02:19.510 get

00:02:21.580 veggies

00:02:21.880 here
00:02:22.239 and
00:02:22.450 so
00:02:22.870 that's
00:02:23.020 going
00:02:23.170 to
00:02:23.230 take
00:02:23.440 the

00:02:23.560 water
00:02:23.770 out
00:02:23.860 of
00:02:24.040 the
00:02:24.310 vegetables
00:02:24.340 and
00:02:24.940 into

00:02:25.600 this
00:02:26.350 solution

00:02:27.280 I'll
00:02:27.340 show
00:02:27.519 you
00:02:27.549 how
00:02:28.150 this

00:02:28.600 light
00:02:28.750 creates
00:02:29.110 the
00:02:29.290 brine
00:02:29.500 I
00:02:29.830 don't
00:02:30.459 add

00:02:30.610 water
00:02:30.640 when
00:02:31.120 I
00:02:31.150 make
00:02:31.330 sauerkraut
00:02:31.510 mmm
00:02:32.320 so
00:02:32.500 it's

00:02:32.620 going
00:02:32.739 to
00:02:32.799 be
00:02:32.920 a
00:02:32.950 little
00:02:33.160 bit
00:02:33.280 more
00:02:33.400 potent

00:02:33.760 than
00:02:33.820 your
00:02:34.000 normal
00:02:34.120 sauerkraut
00:02:35.080 that's
00:02:35.290 been

00:02:35.440 watered
00:02:35.769 down
00:02:35.799 essentially
00:02:36.549 it's
00:02:37.000 gonna
00:02:37.239 be

00:02:37.390 sour
00:02:37.690 and
00:02:38.140 delicious
00:02:38.400 so
00:02:39.400 that's
00:02:39.549 all
00:02:39.730 the

00:02:39.790 water
00:02:39.910 you
00:02:40.180 need
00:02:40.360 because
00:02:40.660 you're
00:02:40.780 pulling
00:02:40.900 it

00:02:41.110 out
00:02:41.200 of
00:02:41.290 the
00:02:41.350 cabbage
00:02:41.650 yeah
00:02:41.860 and
00:02:42.100 this
00:02:42.489 is
00:02:42.640 why

00:02:42.760 you
00:02:42.820 want
00:02:43.120 to
00:02:43.180 use
00:02:43.360 fresh
00:02:43.780 organic
00:02:44.650 produce

00:02:45.040 because

00:02:46.120 filled
00:02:46.420 with
00:02:46.510 all
00:02:46.690 this
00:02:46.900 water

00:02:47.170 and
00:02:47.350 that's
00:02:47.680 what
00:02:47.769 we're
00:02:47.860 trying
00:02:48.040 to
00:02:48.130 use
00:02:48.280 to

00:02:48.459 create
00:02:48.700 the
00:02:48.790 bride
00:02:49.000 all
00:02:49.540 right
00:02:49.690 so

00:03:42.819 what's
00:03:43.390 really
00:03:43.689 interesting
00:03:43.870 is
00:03:44.170 we
00:03:44.349 didn't

00:03:44.590 add
00:03:44.739 a
00:03:44.769 starter
00:03:45.250 if

00:03:48.370 the
00:03:49.090 bacteria

00:03:49.750 that

00:03:49.930 living
00:03:50.019 on
00:03:50.590 this
00:03:50.829 cabbage
00:03:51.280 right

00:03:51.670 now
00:03:51.879 and
00:03:52.209 the
00:03:52.299 bacteria
00:03:52.840 probably
00:03:53.109 on
00:03:53.200 my

00:03:53.290 hands
00:03:53.829 you
00:03:54.340 know
00:03:54.430 as
00:03:54.489 I
00:03:54.549 smash
00:03:54.790 this
00:03:55.000 down
00:03:55.060 in

00:03:55.299 here
00:03:55.390 are
00:03:55.750 the
00:03:55.959 bacteria
00:03:56.109 that
00:03:56.439 are
00:03:56.500 going
00:03:56.650 to

00:03:56.709 inoculate
00:03:57.040 and
00:03:57.519 start
00:03:57.730 growing
00:03:57.970 now
00:03:58.689 that

00:03:58.870 we've
00:03:58.989 created
00:03:59.109 this
00:03:59.349 anaerobic
00:03:59.799 environment

00:04:00.310 so
00:04:00.730 the
00:04:00.819 way
00:04:00.939 that
00:04:01.060 I
00:04:01.090 do
00:04:01.209 it
00:04:01.329 I
00:04:01.510 like
00:04:01.750 these

00:04:01.930 jars
00:04:02.260 because
00:04:03.129 they're
00:04:03.430 really
00:04:03.549 easy
00:04:03.670 you

00:04:03.969 don't
00:04:04.180 really
00:04:04.329 want
00:04:04.569 to
00:04:04.599 clamp
00:04:04.870 it
00:04:05.019 all
00:04:05.109 the

00:04:05.200 way
00:04:05.290 down
00:04:05.500 you
00:04:06.129 just
00:04:06.310 leave
00:04:06.489 it
00:04:06.609 like
00:04:06.639 this

00:04:06.970 right
00:04:07.750 so
00:04:07.959 the
00:04:08.109 air
00:04:08.260 can
00:04:08.709 like
00:04:08.889 basically
00:04:09.849 like

00:04:10.090 flow
00:04:10.480 out
00:04:10.689 the
00:04:10.840 carbon
00:04:11.109 dioxide
00:04:11.500 can
00:04:11.620 flow
00:04:11.829 out

00:04:11.859 as
00:04:12.129 it
00:04:12.220 ferments
00:04:12.669 but
00:04:13.299 you
00:04:13.540 don't
00:04:13.720 have
00:04:13.810 a
00:04:13.870 lot

00:04:14.139 of
00:04:14.230 stuff
00:04:14.470 from
00:04:14.620 your
00:04:15.010 kitchen

00:04:15.790 your

00:04:15.939 house
00:04:16.209 flying
00:04:16.750 in
00:04:17.169 right
00:04:17.949 so

00:04:19.720 is
00:04:19.989 one
00:04:20.259 that
00:04:20.410 has

00:04:20.500 been
00:04:20.650 going
00:04:20.709 for
00:04:21.190 a
00:04:21.340 few

00:05:45.430 again

00:05:46.430 totally
00:05:47.030 different
00:05:47.270 color

00:05:48.290 you

00:05:48.350 can
00:05:48.470 almost
00:05:48.680 like
00:05:49.190 see
00:05:49.550 there's
00:05:49.940 no
00:05:50.180 more

00:05:50.390 white
00:05:50.660 modeling

00:05:54.290 it

00:05:56.050 mm-hmm
00:05:57.170 right
00:05:57.590 and
00:05:57.800 so
00:05:57.890 what's
00:05:58.100 changed
00:05:58.190 is

00:05:58.670 this

00:06:00.620 that
00:06:00.740 sour

00:06:00.980 flavor
00:06:01.430 is
00:06:01.640 the
00:06:01.790 lactic
00:06:02.150 acid

00:06:02.690 so
00:06:03.020 as
00:06:03.110 you
00:06:03.230 ferment
00:06:03.650 you
00:06:04.070 basically
00:06:04.520 are

00:06:04.850 letting
00:06:05.840 these
00:06:05.990 bacteria
00:06:06.560 create
00:06:07.220 lactic

00:06:08.120 acid
00:06:08.480 and
00:06:08.600 carbon
00:06:08.900 dioxide
00:06:09.340 interesting
00:06:10.340 so

00:06:10.490 the
00:06:10.580 food
00:06:10.790 it
00:06:11.270 blocks

00:06:17.240 when
00:06:17.360 we
00:06:17.450 eat
00:06:17.630 it
00:06:17.660 they
00:06:18.200 come

00:06:18.380 in
00:06:18.470 to
00:06:18.530 us
00:06:18.560 right

00:06:20.960 you

00:06:21.500 know
00:06:21.620 this
00:06:21.770 action
