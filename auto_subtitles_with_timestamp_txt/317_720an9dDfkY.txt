00:02:11.850 this
00:02:12.330 just

00:02:12.690 takes
00:02:12.930 some
00:02:13.730 two
00:02:14.730 minutes
00:02:15.030 so

00:02:15.870 on
00:02:16.610 high

00:02:18.330 minutes
00:02:18.600 all
00:02:18.720 you

00:02:19.200 half

00:02:32.489 cook
00:02:32.670 your
00:02:32.820 onions
00:02:32.850 first

00:02:36.840 so
00:02:37.840 I
00:02:37.870 just
00:02:38.140 added
00:02:38.380 some
00:02:39.330 chicken
00:02:40.330 stock
00:02:40.750 that

00:02:40.810 I
00:02:41.020 made
00:02:41.290 last
00:02:42.040 night
00:02:42.220 and
00:02:42.670 this
00:02:43.360 is
00:02:43.540 just

00:02:43.690 because
00:02:43.960 I
00:02:44.080 don't
00:02:44.230 really
00:02:44.380 like
00:02:44.470 using
00:02:44.800 a
00:02:45.010 lot

00:02:45.160 of
00:02:45.190 oil
00:02:45.400 so
00:02:46.390 I'm
00:02:46.540 just
00:02:46.630 going
00:02:46.750 to
00:02:46.840 add
00:02:46.930 some

00:02:47.140 cabbage
00:02:47.380 now

00:02:53.870 what
00:02:54.870 would
00:02:55.020 also
00:02:55.170 be
00:02:55.380 better
00:02:55.560 if
00:02:55.710 you
00:02:55.800 could

00:02:56.040 like
00:02:56.280 maybe
00:02:56.520 roast
00:02:56.970 the
00:02:57.360 onions
00:02:57.960 and
00:02:58.400 cabbage

00:02:59.400 as
00:03:00.120 well
00:03:00.390 as
00:03:00.510 the
00:03:00.750 cauliflower
00:03:01.350 and
00:03:01.710 rutabaga

00:03:02.190 would
00:03:02.820 have
00:03:03.000 a
00:03:03.600 nicer
00:03:04.200 flavor
00:03:04.410 but
00:03:05.240 like
00:03:06.240 I

00:03:06.360 said
00:03:06.420 I
00:03:06.660 don't
00:03:06.720 really
00:03:06.870 like
00:03:07.140 using
00:03:07.320 oils
00:03:07.860 so

00:03:08.070 this
00:03:08.730 is
00:03:08.880 probably
00:03:09.210 like
00:03:09.270 the
00:03:09.420 most

00:03:09.660 healthiest
00:03:10.170 way
00:03:10.260 you
00:03:10.320 could
00:03:10.530 do
00:03:10.620 it
00:03:10.650 I'll
00:03:11.460 also

00:03:11.700 add
00:03:11.940 in
00:03:12.120 the
00:03:12.240 garlic
00:03:14.120 and
00:03:15.120 then
00:03:15.390 just
00:03:15.630 add
00:03:15.750 some

00:03:16.020 salt
00:03:16.290 and
00:03:16.470 pepper
00:03:24.800 so
00:03:25.800 now
00:03:25.920 that
00:03:25.980 my

00:03:26.540 cauliflower
00:03:27.540 and
00:03:27.840 rutabaga
00:03:28.320 are
00:03:28.680 steamed
00:03:29.400 I'm

00:03:29.700 just
00:03:29.910 gonna
00:03:30.120 blend

00:03:41.460 to
00:03:42.420 give
00:03:42.540 it
00:03:42.660 some

00:03:52.810 now
00:03:53.650 just
00:03:53.950 add
00:03:54.130 the
00:03:54.160 cabbage
00:03:54.819 and
00:03:54.940 onions

00:03:58.560 instead
00:03:59.560 of
00:03:59.770 bacon
00:04:00.250 or
00:04:00.490 ham
00:04:00.900 I'm
00:04:01.900 just
00:04:02.050 gonna

00:04:02.140 add
00:04:02.260 some
00:04:02.620 Turkey
00:04:06.180 and
00:04:07.180 if
00:04:07.480 you
00:04:07.569 don't
00:04:07.750 want
00:04:07.870 to

00:04:07.959 use
00:04:08.110 rutabaga

00:04:12.760 the

00:04:12.880 cauliflower
00:04:13.270 actually
00:04:13.810 tastes
00:04:14.140 like
00:04:14.290 mashed

00:04:14.590 potatoes
00:04:16.200 and
