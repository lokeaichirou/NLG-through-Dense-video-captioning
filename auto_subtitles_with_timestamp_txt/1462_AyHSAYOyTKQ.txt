00:02:55.930 this
00:02:56.140 and

00:02:56.470 actually
00:02:57.240 lard
00:02:58.240 on
00:02:58.360 is
00:02:58.540 the
00:02:58.660 name
00:02:58.840 of
00:02:58.870 the

00:02:59.020 restaurant
00:02:59.260 in
00:02:59.890 Toronto
00:03:00.340 on
00:03:00.850 roxas
00:03:01.330 ville

00:03:01.480 Avenue
00:03:01.870 where
00:03:01.990 I
00:03:02.020 got
00:03:02.230 the
00:03:02.380 inspiration
00:03:02.580 for

00:03:03.580 doing
00:03:03.880 this
00:03:04.030 recipe
00:03:04.980 and
00:03:05.980 I'm
00:03:06.160 going
00:03:06.340 to
00:03:06.400 put

00:03:07.330 the
00:03:07.750 bacon
00:03:08.650 lardons
00:03:09.040 into
00:03:09.820 a
00:03:10.150 large
00:03:10.720 pot
00:03:11.520 which

00:03:12.520 has
00:03:12.790 some
00:03:13.120 boiling
00:03:13.750 water
00:03:13.930 in
00:03:14.530 it
00:03:14.770 and
00:03:14.800 that's

00:03:15.489 going
00:03:15.670 to
00:03:15.730 actually
00:03:15.910 help
00:03:16.239 crisp
00:03:16.630 up
00:03:16.840 the

00:03:17.050 bacon
00:03:17.230 and
00:03:17.440 I
00:03:17.590 know
00:03:17.709 that
00:03:17.860 seems

00:03:18.070 counterintuitive
00:03:18.970 but
00:03:19.570 believe
00:03:19.959 me
00:03:19.989 it
00:03:20.350 works

00:03:25.370 ok
00:03:26.370 so
00:03:26.430 my
00:03:26.720 bacon
00:03:27.720 is
00:03:27.840 nice
00:03:28.080 and
00:03:28.350 golden
00:03:29.040 brown

00:03:29.070 and

00:03:34.770 with
00:03:35.130 the
00:03:35.220 fat

00:03:35.430 drain
00:03:35.670 out
00:03:35.820 a
00:03:35.850 little
00:03:36.060 bit
00:03:36.210 you

00:03:38.340 towel
00:03:38.820 I
00:03:39.270 want
00:03:39.600 to
