00:00:39.030 wouldn't
00:00:39.180 make
00:00:39.270 a
00:00:39.329 video
00:00:39.660 of

00:00:40.320 is
00:00:40.500 one
00:00:40.710 that

00:01:54.670 different
00:01:55.120 flavor
00:01:55.330 components
00:01:55.990 so

00:01:56.350 we
00:01:56.470 do
00:01:56.650 need
00:01:56.860 a

00:02:02.140 white
00:02:02.350 sugar
00:02:02.650 would
00:02:02.920 so
00:02:03.130 we
00:02:03.220 don't

00:02:03.370 have

00:02:29.110 is
00:02:29.380 actually

00:02:29.950 fresh
00:02:30.280 ginger
00:02:30.840 it's
00:02:31.840 ground
00:02:32.230 up
00:02:32.470 normally
00:02:33.340 you

00:02:33.520 know
00:02:33.640 with
00:02:33.820 like
00:02:33.970 a
00:02:34.000 jarred
00:02:34.540 garlic
00:02:34.630 or

00:02:35.170 something
00:02:35.470 I
00:02:35.560 don't
00:02:35.800 really
00:02:35.920 recommend
00:02:36.520 using

00:02:36.730 those
00:02:37.000 because
00:02:37.210 they
00:02:37.330 don't
00:02:37.570 taste
00:02:37.840 this

00:02:38.050 fresh
00:02:38.350 but
00:02:38.980 for
00:02:39.160 ginger
00:02:39.520 because
00:02:39.880 I
00:02:40.000 only
00:02:40.210 use

00:02:40.450 it
00:02:40.480 really
00:02:40.930 rarely
00:02:41.170 usually
00:02:41.740 I
00:02:41.770 use
00:02:42.130 a
00:02:42.280 little

00:02:42.580 piece
00:02:42.850 of
00:02:43.030 it
00:02:43.150 and
00:02:43.270 then
00:02:43.360 end
00:02:43.480 up
00:02:43.600 throwing
00:02:43.870 the

00:02:44.020 whole
00:02:44.140 thing
00:02:44.350 away
00:02:44.500 this
00:02:45.130 comes
00:02:45.430 in
00:02:45.580 handy
00:02:45.610 and

00:02:46.150 it
00:02:46.270 still
00:02:46.510 tastes
00:02:46.750 pretty
00:02:46.960 good
00:02:47.230 so
00:02:47.650 I'm
00:02:47.800 going

00:02:47.980 to
00:02:48.040 do
00:02:48.220 about
00:02:48.840 2
00:02:49.840 teaspoons
00:02:50.590 of
00:02:51.600 this
00:02:52.600 ground

00:02:53.260 ginger
00:02:53.710 plus
00:02:54.100 it's
00:02:54.280 a
00:02:54.370 lot
00:02:54.610 easier
00:02:54.820 to
00:02:55.060 use

00:02:55.360 this
00:02:55.600 than
00:02:55.960 to
00:02:56.140 peel
00:02:56.860 and
