00:00:00.060 when
00:00:00.269 I
00:00:00.299 first
00:00:00.510 heard
00:00:00.690 about
00:00:00.810 boneless

00:00:01.199 chicken
00:00:01.829 wings
00:00:02.010 I
00:00:02.250 was
00:00:02.429 like
00:00:02.610 how
00:00:02.850 the
00:00:02.909 heck

00:00:03.179 did
00:00:03.360 they
00:00:03.449 do
00:00:03.510 that
00:00:03.780 then
00:00:04.319 I
00:00:04.350 saw
00:00:04.620 a
00:00:04.650 boneless

00:00:04.920 chicken
00:00:05.339 wing
00:00:05.490 and
00:00:05.520 I'm
00:00:05.670 like
00:00:05.819 nope
00:00:06.180 that's
00:00:06.779 a

00:00:07.020 chicken
00:00:07.440 nugget

00:00:13.070 so
00:00:14.070 the
00:00:14.190 boneless
00:00:14.370 wing
00:00:14.700 is
00:00:14.849 basically
00:00:15.150 a

00:00:15.269 small
00:00:15.420 chicken
00:00:15.839 tender
00:00:16.170 but
00:00:16.379 bigger
00:00:16.590 than

00:00:16.650 popcorn
00:00:16.980 chicken
00:00:17.369 big
00:00:17.789 without
00:00:18.029 chicken
00:00:18.359 lean

00:00:18.539 meat
00:00:18.750 and
00:00:18.779 pays
00:00:19.140 nothing
00:00:19.289 like
00:00:19.590 a
00:00:19.619 chicken

00:00:19.890 wing
00:00:20.010 but
00:00:20.250 that's
00:00:20.400 okay
00:00:20.670 because
00:00:20.699 they're

00:00:21.240 amazing
00:00:21.840 to
00:00:22.080 start
00:00:22.470 cut
00:00:22.680 up
00:00:22.800 some
00:00:22.980 chicken

00:00:23.220 breast
00:00:23.730 meat
00:00:24.060 once
00:00:24.660 in
00:00:24.840 half
00:00:25.050 the
00:00:25.199 long
00:00:25.230 way

00:00:25.619 and
00:00:25.800 then
00:00:26.130 slice
00:00:26.490 the
00:00:26.699 other
00:00:26.849 way
00:00:27.029 into

00:00:27.330 squares
00:00:27.990 then
00:00:28.830 sew
00:00:29.070 your
00:00:29.220 chicken
00:00:29.550 in
00:00:29.640 a
00:00:29.730 brine

00:00:30.000 solution
00:00:30.029 which
00:00:30.750 is
00:00:30.900 a
00:00:30.929 combination
00:00:31.590 of
00:00:31.679 water

00:00:31.980 sugar
00:00:32.399 and
00:00:32.640 salt
00:00:32.910 for
00:00:33.210 six
00:00:33.690 hours
00:00:34.110 you're

00:00:34.710 strapped
00:00:35.040 for
00:00:35.070 time
00:00:35.309 and
00:00:35.760 things
00:00:36.000 tasting

00:00:36.390 good
00:00:36.510 isn't
00:00:36.660 a
00:00:36.780 priority
00:00:37.230 you
00:00:37.410 can
00:00:37.739 skip
00:00:38.070 this

00:00:38.250 step
00:00:38.309 now
00:00:39.030 combine
00:00:39.390 the
00:00:39.510 following
00:00:39.660 dry

00:00:40.290 into
00:00:40.920 a
00:00:40.950 shallow
00:00:41.280 bowl
00:00:41.670 the

00:00:42.149 secret
00:00:42.540 here
00:00:42.750 is
00:00:42.780 using
00:00:43.170 the
00:00:43.260 cornstarch

00:00:43.860 which
00:00:44.160 will
00:00:44.280 make
00:00:44.460 a
00:00:44.489 more
00:00:44.789 protective
00:00:45.360 crispy

00:00:45.780 coating

00:00:46.350 similar
00:00:46.860 texture
00:00:47.219 you

00:00:48.390 the
00:00:49.140 wet

00:00:49.320 ingredients
00:00:49.500 is
00:00:50.129 a
00:00:50.160 standard
00:00:50.670 ratio
00:00:50.850 of
00:00:51.270 egg

00:00:51.539 milk
00:00:52.079 and
00:00:52.379 water
00:00:52.530 for

00:00:53.399 sauce
00:00:53.699 most

00:00:54.149 common

00:00:55.199 known
00:00:55.350 as

00:00:58.079 but
