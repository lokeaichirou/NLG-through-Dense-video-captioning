00:00:06.150 this
00:00:07.150 is
00:00:07.330 our
00:00:07.540 cabbage
00:00:08.080 plot
00:00:08.469 we've
00:00:09.130 planted

00:00:09.430 our
00:00:09.730 cabbage
00:00:10.210 from
00:00:10.420 seed
00:00:10.840 last
00:00:11.200 spring
00:00:11.769 it
00:00:12.309 is

00:00:12.370 an
00:00:12.610 old
00:00:12.790 Irish
00:00:13.469 variety
00:00:14.469 called
00:00:14.710 quarter
00:00:15.370 hawk

00:00:15.700 since
00:00:16.660 October
00:00:17.320 we've
00:00:17.500 been
00:00:17.740 harvesting

00:00:17.949 cabbage
00:00:18.760 it
00:00:19.390 is
00:00:19.630 January
00:00:19.960 now
00:00:20.440 and
00:00:20.740 the

00:00:21.279 cabbage
00:00:21.670 kept
00:00:22.000 well
00:00:22.330 despite
00:00:22.900 frost
00:00:23.320 and
00:00:23.680 rain

00:00:23.890 the
00:00:24.640 outer
00:00:24.850 leaves
00:00:25.180 start
00:00:25.689 to
00:00:25.810 turn
00:00:25.990 brown
00:00:26.050 but

00:00:26.980 further
00:00:27.279 in
00:00:27.609 the
00:00:27.970 cabbage
00:00:28.359 is
00:00:28.600 still
00:00:28.869 perfect

00:00:29.500 and
00:00:29.980 today
00:00:30.430 you're
00:00:30.820 going
00:00:31.000 to
00:00:31.210 make

00:00:31.390 sauerkraut
00:00:31.720 or
00:00:32.559 in
00:00:32.679 Bricker
00:00:33.039 behind
00:00:33.609 me

00:00:33.760 cabbage
00:00:34.120 in
00:00:34.479 Ireland
00:00:35.440 people
00:00:36.129 don't
00:00:36.309 really

00:00:36.489 eat
00:00:36.760 much
00:00:37.030 sauerkraut
00:00:37.690 where
00:00:38.499 I
00:00:38.530 grew
00:00:38.979 up
00:00:39.010 we

00:00:39.699 had
00:00:39.909 it
00:00:40.059 for
00:00:40.089 breakfast
00:00:40.780 lunch
00:00:41.019 and
00:00:41.289 dinner
00:00:41.729 so

00:00:42.729 literally
00:00:43.299 all
00:00:43.329 the
00:00:43.629 time
00:00:43.659 and
00:00:44.199 I
00:00:44.799 quite
00:00:45.039 miss

00:00:45.339 it
00:00:45.519 sometimes

00:00:46.179 I
00:00:48.329 have
00:00:49.329 a
00:00:49.359 special
00:00:49.749 cabbage
00:00:50.350 grater
00:00:50.739 which
00:00:51.309 my

00:00:51.549 mum
00:00:51.819 gave
00:00:52.119 to
00:00:52.389 me
00:00:52.510 and
00:00:52.719 I
00:00:53.260 can
00:00:53.469 shred
00:00:53.709 the

00:00:53.769 cabbage
00:00:54.129 with
00:00:54.729 ease
00:00:55.350 the
00:00:56.350 cabbage
00:00:56.799 head
00:00:57.039 is

00:00:57.219 not
00:00:57.399 very
00:00:57.670 tight
00:00:58.119 so
00:00:58.839 I
00:00:58.869 have
00:00:59.049 to
00:00:59.199 keep
00:00:59.350 pushing

00:00:59.619 it
00:00:59.889 together
00:01:00.069 while
00:01:00.549 I
00:01:00.729 grate
00:01:07.500 it
00:01:08.500 is
00:01:08.799 very

00:01:18.290 now
00:01:19.290 I
00:01:19.650 weigh
00:01:20.220 the
00:01:20.490 cabbage
00:01:20.940 because
00:01:21.420 I
00:01:21.750 want

00:01:21.930 to
00:01:22.049 add
00:01:22.200 the
00:01:22.470 right
00:01:22.680 quantity
00:01:23.340 of
00:01:23.460 salt
00:01:23.820 one

00:01:24.570 two
00:01:24.810 hundred
00:01:25.229 for
00:01:25.440 sauerkraut
00:01:25.800 so
00:01:26.610 for
00:01:26.820 these

00:01:27.000 one
00:01:27.360 and
00:01:27.479 a
00:01:27.570 half
00:01:27.750 kilos
00:01:28.080 I
00:01:28.530 need
00:01:28.770 15
00:01:29.280 grams

00:01:29.580 sold
00:01:30.030 approximately
00:01:30.659 one
00:01:31.560 tablespoon
00:01:32.430 I
00:01:34.640 also

00:01:35.640 add
00:01:36.270 a
00:01:36.330 capsule
00:01:37.050 of
00:01:37.229 lactic
00:01:37.740 acid
00:01:38.159 bacteria
00:01:38.909 I

00:01:39.149 could
00:01:39.720 also
00:01:39.869 use
00:01:40.020 buttermilk
00:01:40.770 which
00:01:41.100 would

00:01:41.310 work
00:01:41.580 just
00:01:41.610 as
00:01:42.090 well
00:01:42.360 to
00:01:42.659 start
00:01:42.960 the

00:01:43.110 fermentation
00:01:43.470 process
00:01:45.979 then
00:01:46.979 I
00:01:47.250 start

00:01:47.759 massaging
00:01:47.970 the
00:01:48.690 cabbage
00:01:49.080 with
00:01:49.290 my
00:01:49.440 hands
00:01:50.039 and

00:01:50.250 soon
00:01:50.580 there's
00:01:50.940 liquid
00:01:51.179 running
00:01:51.570 off
00:01:51.780 the

00:01:51.960 cabbage
00:01:52.320 which
00:01:52.590 is
00:01:52.770 good
00:01:53.009 when
00:01:53.670 it
00:01:53.820 looks
00:01:54.060 like

00:01:54.300 this
00:01:54.539 I
00:01:54.780 stop
00:01:55.200 and
00:01:55.500 fill
00:01:56.160 the
00:01:56.310 cabbage
00:01:56.759 into

00:01:57.390 preserving
00:01:57.630 jars
00:01:58.410 I
00:01:58.800 make
00:01:59.340 sure
00:01:59.670 to
00:01:59.700 divide

00:02:00.630 the
00:02:00.929 liquid
00:02:01.350 evenly
00:02:01.920 between
00:02:02.070 jars
00:02:07.399 then
00:02:08.399 I

00:02:08.729 crush
00:02:09.300 the
00:02:09.509 cabbage
00:02:09.840 further
00:02:10.320 with
00:02:10.590 a
00:02:10.619 rolling

00:02:10.920 pin
00:02:11.660 because
00:02:12.660 we
00:02:13.050 don't
00:02:13.260 eat
00:02:13.440 that
00:02:13.680 much

00:02:13.920 sauerkraut
00:02:14.519 we
00:02:15.030 make
00:02:15.239 it
00:02:15.390 in
00:02:15.510 small
00:02:15.780 jars

00:02:16.170 rather
00:02:16.650 than
00:02:16.920 one
00:02:17.130 of
00:02:17.280 those
00:02:17.459 big
00:02:17.880 sauerkraut

00:02:18.600 earthen
00:02:19.050 pots
00:02:19.350 it's
00:02:19.920 more
00:02:20.160 practical
00:02:20.730 I
00:02:21.260 put
00:02:22.260 a

00:02:22.290 clean
00:02:22.709 cabbage
00:02:23.250 leaf
00:02:23.549 on
00:02:23.820 top
00:02:24.090 and
00:02:24.360 push

00:02:24.989 everything
00:02:25.230 down
00:02:25.500 once
00:02:26.070 more
00:02:26.870 it
00:02:27.870 is

00:02:28.709 important
00:02:29.250 that
00:02:29.370 the
00:02:29.640 cabbage
00:02:30.030 is
00:02:30.209 completely

00:02:30.810 covered
00:02:31.230 with
00:02:31.290 liquid
00:02:31.650 as
00:02:32.010 the
00:02:32.519 fermentation

00:02:32.880 process
00:02:33.209 is
00:02:33.780 an
00:02:33.959 aerobic
00:02:34.680 and
00:02:34.860 would
00:02:35.280 be

00:02:35.430 disturbed
00:02:36.060 if
00:02:36.239 air
00:02:36.450 could
00:02:36.690 reach
00:02:36.900 the
00:02:37.170 cabbage

00:02:37.560 the
00:02:38.299 jars
00:02:39.299 remain
00:02:39.870 room
00:02:40.230 temperature
00:02:40.769 for
00:02:40.799 two

00:02:41.100 days
00:02:41.370 then
00:02:41.970 we
00:02:42.180 move
00:02:42.450 them
00:02:42.660 into
00:02:42.900 a
00:02:43.049 cool
00:02:43.290 room

00:02:43.560 for
00:02:43.829 two
00:02:43.980 weeks
00:02:44.570 then
00:02:45.570 we
00:02:45.780 have
00:02:45.900 a
00:02:45.930 first
00:02:46.290 look

00:02:46.410 some
00:02:47.280 people
00:02:47.310 wait
00:02:47.850 for
00:02:47.880 six
00:02:48.299 weeks

00:02:48.930 but
00:02:49.290 we
00:02:49.470 find
00:02:49.829 that
00:02:50.130 often
00:02:50.549 the
00:02:50.760 crowd
00:02:51.060 is
00:02:51.299 sour

00:02:51.540 enough
00:02:51.810 after
00:02:52.260 two
00:02:52.620 weeks
00:02:52.860 oh
00:02:53.780 dear
00:02:54.780 this
00:02:55.320 one

00:02:55.590 looks
00:02:55.829 like
00:02:55.950 it's
00:02:56.280 not
00:02:56.549 gone
00:02:56.820 according
00:02:56.940 to

00:02:57.269 plan
00:02:57.390 it
00:02:58.350 looks
00:02:59.040 a
00:02:59.160 bit
00:02:59.190 rotten
00:02:59.730 and
00:02:59.940 it
00:03:00.090 smells

00:03:00.390 very
00:03:00.810 foul
00:03:01.400 sometimes
00:03:02.400 this
00:03:02.579 can
00:03:02.910 happen
00:03:03.239 and

00:03:03.540 we
00:03:03.959 just
00:03:04.170 throw
00:03:04.440 it
00:03:04.500 out
00:03:06.530 this
00:03:07.530 jar
00:03:08.010 looks
00:03:08.700 and

00:03:08.940 smell
00:03:09.239 is
00:03:09.420 good

00:03:12.750 you
00:03:13.290 can
00:03:13.530 see
00:03:13.800 how
00:03:14.010 the
00:03:14.070 crowd
00:03:14.370 rose
00:03:15.210 during

00:03:15.660 fermentation
00:03:16.050 and
00:03:16.710 the
00:03:16.770 liquid
00:03:17.160 is
00:03:17.280 at
00:03:17.460 the

00:03:17.580 bottom
00:03:17.940 some
00:03:18.900 people
00:03:19.200 try
00:03:19.380 to
00:03:19.410 avoid
00:03:19.650 this
00:03:20.160 by

00:03:20.400 putting
00:03:20.640 a
00:03:20.910 weight
00:03:21.240 like
00:03:21.540 a
00:03:21.600 stone
00:03:22.110 on
00:03:22.350 top
00:03:22.380 of

00:03:22.740 the
00:03:22.860 cloud
00:03:23.990 okay
00:03:24.990 so
00:03:25.050 hype
00:03:25.380 the
00:03:25.620 tape

00:03:26.100 let's
00:03:26.880 try
00:03:33.050 sour
00:03:36.380 sour
00:03:37.380 and
00:03:37.680 crunchy
00:03:38.100 sour

00:03:38.520 countries
00:03:39.060 all
00:03:39.300 right
00:03:39.560 it's
00:03:40.560 very
00:03:40.590 nice
00:03:41.120 and

00:03:42.120 not
00:03:42.570 one
00:03:42.990 leaf
00:03:43.290 was
00:03:43.740 wasted
00:03:44.250 in
00:03:44.370 the
00:03:44.460 process
