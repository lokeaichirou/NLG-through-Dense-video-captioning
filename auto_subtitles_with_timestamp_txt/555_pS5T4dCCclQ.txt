00:00:06.150 to
00:00:06.240 taste
00:00:06.359 much
00:00:06.720 better
00:00:06.779 than

00:00:12.420 for
00:00:12.570 the
00:00:12.660 job
00:00:14.120 can

00:00:15.120 of
00:00:15.330 drained
00:00:15.690 chickpeas
00:00:17.570 next
00:00:18.570 up
00:00:18.720 the
00:00:19.439 lemon

00:00:19.590 juice
00:00:19.890 lemon
00:00:20.250 zest
00:00:20.430 I'm
00:00:20.789 just
00:00:20.939 going
00:00:21.060 to
00:00:21.090 put

00:00:21.240 in
00:00:21.359 a
00:00:21.600 little
00:00:21.990 bit
00:00:22.199 of
00:00:22.289 the
00:00:22.350 lemon
00:00:22.439 zester

00:00:22.920 right
00:00:23.070 George
00:00:23.189 get
00:00:23.550 a
00:00:23.580 little
00:00:23.910 festive

00:00:24.060 worried
00:00:24.600 about
00:00:24.720 the
00:00:24.840 zest
00:00:25.050 of
00:00:25.199 half
00:00:25.380 a
00:00:25.529 lemon
00:00:25.619 I

00:00:25.890 don't
00:00:26.070 think
00:00:26.220 we
00:00:26.310 need
00:00:26.460 the
00:00:27.140 the
00:00:28.140 whole
00:00:28.289 one

00:00:28.439 especially
00:00:29.039 with
00:00:29.279 a
00:00:29.310 microplane
00:00:29.730 because
00:00:30.150 you

00:00:30.300 get
00:00:30.449 an
00:00:30.990 enormous
00:00:31.410 amount
00:00:31.590 of
00:00:31.710 zest
00:00:31.920 often

00:00:32.219 then
00:00:33.000 we
00:00:33.090 just
00:00:33.210 roll
00:00:33.420 that
00:00:33.600 lemon
00:00:33.870 just
00:00:34.079 to

00:00:34.200 sort
00:00:34.380 of
00:00:34.440 break
00:00:34.620 the
00:00:34.860 segment's
00:00:35.340 inside
00:00:35.700 just

00:00:35.940 to
00:00:36.059 release
00:00:36.360 the
00:00:36.390 juice
00:00:39.230 I'm
00:00:40.230 just
00:00:40.500 going
00:00:40.620 to

00:00:40.680 squeeze
00:00:40.980 the
00:00:41.160 juice
00:00:41.190 of
00:00:41.579 that
00:00:41.730 lemon
00:00:42.090 in

00:00:42.379 obviously
00:00:43.379 just
00:00:43.649 using
00:00:43.920 that
00:00:44.010 little
00:00:44.309 sieve

00:00:44.520 because
00:00:44.789 I
00:00:44.820 don't
00:00:45.030 want
00:00:45.180 the
00:00:45.390 hips
00:00:45.750 in
00:00:45.930 next
00:00:46.739 up

00:00:46.860 half
00:00:47.640 a
00:00:47.760 clove
00:00:47.910 of
00:00:48.059 garlic
00:00:48.120 and
00:00:49.340 then
00:00:50.340 this
00:00:50.489 is

00:00:50.670 tahini
00:00:51.030 this
00:00:51.300 is
00:00:51.449 organic
00:00:51.980 tahini
00:00:52.980 which
00:00:53.219 is

00:00:53.370 beautiful
00:00:54.059 and
00:00:54.239 tahini
00:00:55.230 is
00:00:55.410 a
00:00:55.440 ground
00:00:55.980 sesame

00:00:56.550 seed
00:00:56.940 so
00:00:57.120 it's
00:00:57.239 ground
00:00:57.600 into
00:00:57.870 a
00:00:57.930 paste
00:00:58.109 bit

00:00:58.379 like
00:00:58.530 peanut
00:00:58.890 butter

00:00:59.219 that's
00:00:59.609 essentially
00:01:00.000 what
00:01:00.149 it
00:01:00.239 is
00:01:00.390 so
00:01:00.960 I

00:01:00.989 normally
00:01:01.350 put
00:01:01.500 in
00:01:01.649 a
00:01:01.739 good
00:01:01.920 spoonful
00:01:02.399 of
00:01:02.460 teeny

00:01:03.570 I
00:01:03.690 love
00:01:03.960 the
00:01:04.110 stuff
00:01:05.540 and
00:01:06.540 then
00:01:07.200 a

00:01:07.229 little
00:01:07.409 pinch
00:01:07.740 of
00:01:07.950 mild
00:01:08.700 paprika
00:01:09.240 a
00:01:09.710 little

00:01:10.710 pinch
00:01:10.890 of
00:01:10.979 salt
00:01:11.040 from
00:01:11.430 George
00:01:11.670 and
00:01:11.850 then
00:01:12.000 just

00:01:12.240 a
00:01:12.330 bit
00:01:12.450 of
00:01:12.540 good
00:01:13.290 extra
00:01:13.770 virgin
00:01:13.830 olive
00:01:14.159 oil

00:01:24.710 going
00:01:25.480 and

00:01:27.680 you're
00:01:27.770 doing
00:01:28.010 is

00:01:30.890 bit
00:01:31.070 more

00:01:31.100 oil
00:01:31.460 it's
00:01:31.970 probably

00:01:32.300 to
00:01:32.360 be
00:01:32.420 about
