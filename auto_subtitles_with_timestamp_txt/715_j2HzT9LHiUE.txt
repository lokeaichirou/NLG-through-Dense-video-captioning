00:01:55.200 and
00:01:55.829 therefore
00:01:56.250 some
00:01:56.399 onion
00:01:56.790 flavor

00:01:57.090 I've
00:01:57.299 just
00:01:57.450 got
00:01:57.600 these
00:01:57.750 spring
00:01:58.079 onions
00:01:58.380 I
00:01:58.530 make

00:01:59.040 it
00:01:59.219 really
00:01:59.579 chunky
00:01:59.820 and
00:02:00.119 course
00:02:00.360 you
00:02:00.630 know
00:02:00.719 it

00:02:00.899 doesn't
00:02:01.079 need
00:02:01.229 to
00:02:01.530 be
00:02:01.649 really
00:02:02.189 fine
00:02:02.430 but
00:02:02.790 I

00:02:02.939 reckon
00:02:03.299 this
00:02:03.420 is
00:02:03.540 sort
00:02:03.719 of
00:02:03.750 nice
00:02:04.229 and
00:02:04.530 rustic
00:02:06.110 I

00:02:07.110 have
00:02:07.350 her
00:02:07.500 garlic
00:02:07.860 chives
00:02:08.099 really
00:02:08.879 pungent

00:02:09.149 and
00:02:09.479 strong
00:02:09.869 but
00:02:10.110 I
00:02:10.289 reckon
00:02:10.619 they
00:02:10.709 go
00:02:10.860 really

00:02:11.500 dumplings
00:02:11.890 and
00:02:12.100 that's
00:02:12.490 why
00:02:12.580 they
00:02:12.790 mix
00:02:13.060 that

00:02:13.210 around
00:02:13.330 like
00:02:13.630 that
00:02:13.870 right
00:02:14.490 it's
00:02:15.490 insulting
00:02:15.970 it

00:02:16.060 and
00:02:16.240 have
00:02:16.480 you
00:02:16.570 put
00:02:16.720 any
00:02:16.930 soy
00:02:17.140 sauce
00:02:17.470 in
00:02:17.710 there

00:02:17.830 yes
00:02:17.980 I
00:02:18.760 say
00:02:18.940 if
00:02:19.000 you
00:02:19.090 grab
00:02:19.300 the
00:02:19.420 soy
00:02:19.600 sauce
00:02:19.660 I'll

00:02:20.380 put
00:02:20.680 a
00:02:20.710 pinch
00:02:20.950 of
00:02:21.040 salt
00:02:21.250 in
00:02:21.430 it
00:02:21.520 about
00:02:22.210 a

00:02:22.690 teaspoon
00:02:23.260 or
00:02:23.350 a
00:02:23.410 key
00:02:23.530 you
00:02:23.650 don't
00:02:23.740 need
00:02:23.920 a
00:02:23.950 lot

00:02:24.190 in
00:02:24.340 there
00:02:24.490 I've
00:02:24.910 got
00:02:24.970 some

00:02:25.600 here
00:02:25.930 nice

00:02:26.170 and
00:02:26.200 cause
00:02:26.710 I
00:02:26.830 love
00:02:27.040 the
00:02:27.190 Asian

00:02:27.760 with

00:02:27.940 pepper
00:02:28.300 I
00:02:28.600 think

00:02:28.870 really
00:02:29.080 sort
00:02:29.200 of

00:03:27.220 around
00:03:27.340 my

00:03:27.610 house
00:03:28.290 now

00:03:30.040 sort
00:03:30.280 of

00:03:30.700 little
00:03:31.000 bit

00:03:31.120 sort
00:03:31.420 of

00:03:32.590 them

00:03:32.830 off
00:03:32.950 and
00:03:33.130 I

00:03:33.459 be
00:03:33.549 nice
00:03:33.700 and
00:03:33.880 sort
00:03:34.060 of

00:03:34.120 chunky
00:03:34.390 and
00:03:34.630 let's
00:03:34.870 see
00:03:34.959 how
00:03:35.049 easy
00:03:35.290 it
00:03:35.380 is
00:03:35.500 but

00:03:35.620 that
00:03:35.739 little
00:03:35.860 piece
00:03:36.070 is
00:03:36.220 done
00:03:37.200 but
00:03:38.200 I
00:03:38.290 reckon

00:03:38.560 what
00:03:38.739 you've
00:03:38.920 made
00:03:39.130 about
00:03:39.400 ten
00:03:39.670 or
00:03:39.820 twenty
00:03:40.060 of

00:03:40.209 these
00:03:40.360 you'll
00:03:40.900 sort
00:03:41.110 of
00:03:41.140 get
00:03:41.260 the
00:03:41.350 hang
00:03:41.410 of
00:03:41.500 it

00:03:41.620 really
00:03:41.799 well
00:03:41.920 the
00:03:42.250 trick
00:03:42.459 is
00:03:42.610 when
00:03:42.760 you're

00:03:42.880 doing
00:03:42.970 them
00:03:43.120 it's
00:03:43.299 keep
00:03:43.480 a
00:03:43.510 little
00:03:43.690 bit
00:03:43.870 of

00:03:43.959 flour
00:03:44.110 on
00:03:44.170 your
00:03:44.320 finger
00:03:44.709 so
00:03:44.890 it
00:03:44.980 stops
00:03:45.280 it
00:03:45.400 from

00:03:45.430 sticking
00:03:45.730 now
00:03:46.209 you've
00:03:46.329 got
00:03:46.480 the
00:03:46.600 Rathore

00:03:46.810 there
00:03:47.079 now
00:03:47.440 the
00:03:47.500 thing
00:03:47.739 is
00:03:47.769 when
00:03:48.010 you're
00:03:48.100 using

00:03:48.340 pork
00:03:48.730 and
00:03:48.970 prawn
00:03:49.269 raw
00:03:50.230 meat
00:03:50.500 like
00:03:50.620 that

00:03:50.860 instead
00:03:51.100 of
00:03:51.160 living
00:03:51.310 it
00:03:51.489 on
00:03:51.579 the
00:03:51.700 bench
00:03:51.880 you

00:03:52.000 know
00:03:52.180 waiting
00:03:52.570 for
00:03:52.720 your
00:03:52.810 dough
00:03:52.959 to
00:03:53.380 rest
00:03:53.560 you

00:03:53.950 must
00:03:54.310 put
00:03:54.519 it
00:03:54.579 in
00:03:54.640 the
00:03:54.700 fridge
00:03:54.910 and
00:03:55.060 keep
00:03:55.209 it

00:03:55.360 nice
00:03:55.540 and
00:03:55.570 cold

00:03:56.170 now
00:03:56.410 what
00:03:56.650 we've
00:03:56.799 got
