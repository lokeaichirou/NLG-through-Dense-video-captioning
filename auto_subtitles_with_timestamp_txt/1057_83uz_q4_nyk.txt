00:02:29.520 so
00:02:29.640 you
00:02:29.730 can
00:02:29.820 see
00:02:29.880 so
00:02:30.450 I
00:02:30.480 cut
00:02:30.720 it
00:02:30.840 lengthwise

00:02:31.110 like
00:02:32.090 that
00:02:33.090 and
00:02:33.660 then
00:02:34.290 while
00:02:34.650 I'm
00:02:34.740 holding
00:02:34.890 it

00:02:36.210 I
00:02:36.560 cut
00:02:37.560 it
00:02:37.590 side
00:02:37.890 to
00:02:38.070 side
00:02:38.280 so
00:02:39.030 then
00:02:39.180 you
00:02:39.300 get

00:02:39.450 these
00:02:39.600 like
00:02:39.900 little
00:02:40.080 fourths
00:02:40.590 of
00:02:40.680 a
00:02:40.860 cup
00:02:40.890 of

00:02:41.340 grapes
00:02:41.670 and
00:02:41.940 those
00:02:42.390 are
00:02:42.540 really
00:02:42.780 good
00:02:43.050 to
00:02:43.260 kind

00:02:43.440 of
00:02:43.590 to
00:02:44.460 buy
00:02:44.670 they're
00:02:44.940 little
00:02:45.330 smaller
00:02:45.600 than

00:02:45.780 bite
00:02:45.960 size
00:02:46.230 so
00:02:46.500 it
00:02:46.590 really
00:02:46.800 mixes
00:02:47.160 in
00:02:47.310 well

00:02:47.490 with
00:02:47.700 the
00:02:47.850 chicken
00:02:48.000 and
00:02:48.180 everything
00:02:48.570 you
00:02:49.350 can

00:02:49.470 see
00:02:49.590 I
00:02:49.620 didn't
00:02:49.980 use
00:02:50.100 all
00:02:50.190 my
00:02:50.370 Apple
00:02:50.790 and
00:02:50.970 I

00:02:51.330 still
00:02:51.570 have
00:02:51.750 three
00:02:52.350 like
00:02:52.950 sections
00:02:53.460 left
00:02:53.700 what

00:02:54.390 I
00:02:54.420 will
00:02:54.720 probably
00:02:55.050 do
00:02:55.650 since
00:02:55.980 I
00:02:56.070 have
00:02:56.280 chicken

00:02:56.640 leftover
00:02:57.030 I'm
00:02:57.810 gonna
00:02:57.990 have
00:02:58.080 plenty
00:02:58.290 of
00:02:58.500 grapes

00:02:58.860 and
00:02:59.100 have
00:02:59.340 plenty
00:03:00.120 of
00:03:00.210 celery
00:03:01.050 I've
00:03:01.170 got

00:03:01.350 plenty
00:03:01.470 of
00:03:01.560 everything
00:03:01.920 by
00:03:02.070 the
00:03:02.130 way
00:03:02.280 that
00:03:02.400 was

00:03:02.520 about
00:03:02.730 two
00:03:02.940 stalks
00:03:03.270 of
00:03:03.450 celery
00:03:03.510 was
00:03:04.050 what
00:03:04.230 that

00:03:04.380 was
00:03:04.610 I
00:03:05.610 will
00:03:06.510 probably
00:03:06.720 make
00:03:06.990 another
00:03:07.170 like

00:03:07.950 two
00:03:08.840 probably
00:03:09.840 two
00:03:10.020 smaller
00:03:10.500 batches
00:03:10.800 of
00:03:11.490 this

00:03:11.820 this
00:03:12.750 will
00:03:12.960 probably
00:03:13.290 make
00:03:13.410 about
00:03:13.880 I
00:03:14.880 think
00:03:15.270 it

00:03:15.390 makes
00:03:15.510 about
00:03:15.720 four
00:03:16.020 cups
00:03:16.520 and
00:03:17.520 will
00:03:18.000 tell
00:03:18.180 you

00:03:18.239 the
00:03:18.330 calories
00:03:18.540 and
00:03:18.780 stuff
00:03:19.110 too
00:03:19.440 but
00:03:20.190 I
00:03:20.700 think

00:03:20.880 it
00:03:21.060 makes
00:03:21.180 about
00:03:21.420 four
00:03:21.690 cups
00:03:21.900 of
00:03:22.140 just
00:03:22.410 this

00:03:22.650 batch
00:03:23.160 and
00:03:23.640 then
00:03:24.540 and
00:03:25.470 then
00:03:25.590 all
00:03:26.870 I'll
00:03:27.870 make
00:03:28.080 up

00:03:28.290 the
00:03:28.320 rest
00:03:28.650 you
00:03:29.100 can
00:03:29.220 see
00:03:29.370 how
00:03:29.459 much
00:03:29.580 chicken
00:03:29.940 I

00:03:30.000 have
00:03:30.030 left
00:03:30.420 here
00:03:30.660 which
00:03:31.380 is
00:03:31.500 probably
00:03:31.800 about

00:03:32.040 as
00:03:32.250 much
00:03:32.489 as
00:03:32.700 that
00:03:32.910 so
00:03:33.180 I
00:03:33.209 could
00:03:33.390 probably
00:03:33.480 make

00:03:33.720 two
00:03:33.930 batches
00:03:34.470 I've
00:03:35.070 got
00:03:35.280 enough
00:03:35.550 Apple
00:03:35.970 I

00:03:36.030 believe
00:03:36.420 and
00:03:36.720 maybe
00:03:36.810 a
00:03:36.989 little
00:03:37.110 less
00:03:37.350 on
00:03:37.530 the

00:03:37.590 second
00:03:37.950 batch
00:03:38.070 from
00:03:38.280 the
00:03:38.370 first
00:03:38.580 batch
00:03:38.790 maybe

00:03:39.510 I'll
00:03:39.690 grab
00:03:39.870 a
00:03:39.930 little
00:03:40.260 bit
00:03:40.350 of
00:03:40.440 this
00:03:40.560 and
00:03:40.830 save

00:03:41.310 it
00:03:41.489 because
00:03:41.640 I
00:03:41.880 probably
00:03:42.120 scooped
00:03:42.600 it
00:03:42.750 over

00:03:43.110 this
00:03:43.230 it
00:03:43.440 was
00:03:43.530 praying
00:03:43.770 a
00:03:44.070 little
00:03:44.640 bit
00:03:44.730 of
00:03:44.820 a

00:03:44.880 heaping
00:03:45.270 half
00:03:45.720 cup
00:03:46.110 when
00:03:46.380 I
00:03:46.410 was
00:03:46.620 making
00:03:46.770 them

00:03:47.040 so
00:03:47.400 I
00:03:47.459 could
00:03:47.550 take
00:03:47.760 a
00:03:47.820 handful
00:03:48.270 and
00:03:48.330 not
00:03:48.570 a
00:03:48.600 huge

00:03:48.840 handful
00:03:49.170 just
00:03:49.200 a
00:03:49.440 piece
00:03:49.620 of
00:03:49.650 those
00:03:49.920 and
00:03:50.489 sit

00:03:50.730 aside
00:03:51.030 and
00:03:51.300 mix
00:03:51.480 it
00:03:51.600 all
00:03:51.720 together
00:03:51.810 and
00:03:52.080 do

00:03:52.200 another
00:03:52.440 batch
00:03:52.739 that
00:03:53.459 way
00:03:53.610 she's
00:03:53.820 got
00:03:53.970 enough

00:03:54.209 to
00:03:54.239 last

00:03:55.020 much

00:03:57.570 mills
00:03:57.810 and
00:03:57.930 they
00:03:58.020 will

00:03:59.250 about
00:03:59.340 a
00:03:59.459 week

00:04:20.880 so
00:04:21.120 I'm
00:04:21.209 literally
00:04:21.480 measuring
00:04:22.470 out

00:04:22.590 my
00:04:22.770 wallets
00:04:23.130 because
00:04:23.250 you're

00:04:31.500 set
00:04:31.590 of
00:04:31.650 calories

00:04:32.130 and
00:04:32.400 literally
00:04:33.000 I'm
00:04:33.180 going
00:04:33.330 to
00:04:33.390 let
00:04:33.540 it
00:04:33.570 sit

00:04:33.840 there
00:04:34.020 it
00:04:34.170 doesn't
00:04:34.350 look
00:04:34.530 like
00:04:34.590 much
00:04:34.860 but
00:04:35.280 they

00:04:35.760 don't
00:04:35.940 add
00:04:36.000 a
00:04:36.030 lot
00:04:36.390 of
00:04:36.420 flavor
00:04:36.930 and
00:04:37.140 you

00:04:37.380 really
00:04:37.650 big
00:04:37.830 pieces
00:04:38.070 like
00:04:38.340 this
00:04:38.550 now
00:04:39.300 what

00:04:39.480 I'll
00:04:39.600 do
00:04:39.750 is
00:04:39.780 sometimes
00:04:40.140 break
00:04:40.500 them
00:04:40.650 into

00:04:40.770 smaller
00:04:40.830 pieces
00:04:42.050 just
00:04:43.050 did
00:04:43.230 but
00:04:43.620 spread
00:04:44.070 a

00:04:44.100 little
00:04:44.250 bit
00:04:44.370 more
00:04:44.610 and
00:04:44.790 the
00:04:44.880 flavor
00:04:45.120 will
00:04:45.390 be

00:04:45.419 there
00:04:45.780 but
00:04:46.650 you
00:04:46.770 don't
00:04:46.890 need
00:04:47.010 big
00:04:47.160 hunks
00:04:47.550 of

00:04:47.669 walnut

00:04:48.900 need
00:04:49.050 small

00:04:49.380 pieces
00:04:50.180 but
00:04:51.180 these
00:04:51.360 will
00:04:51.660 once
00:04:52.110 the
00:04:52.290 pan

00:04:52.470 starts
00:04:52.800 heating
00:04:52.950 up
00:04:53.190 it
00:04:53.460 will
00:04:53.700 you
00:04:54.690 don't
00:04:54.870 want

00:04:55.020 burn
00:04:55.200 them

00:04:55.560 they'll
00:04:55.850 do
00:04:56.850 get
00:04:57.030 hot
00:04:57.180 pretty
00:04:57.450 fast
00:05:04.520 Amyas

00:05:52.800 do
00:05:52.920 is
00:05:53.220 I
00:05:53.340 kind
00:05:53.520 of
00:05:53.640 turn
00:05:53.940 this
00:05:54.270 to

00:05:54.540 where
00:05:54.690 it
00:05:54.780 kind
00:05:54.960 of

00:05:55.590 together

00:05:56.720 you
00:05:57.720 know
00:05:57.840 roughly
00:05:58.200 mixing
00:05:58.590 it
00:05:58.680 together
00:05:59.150 cuz

00:06:00.150 you
00:06:00.210 don't
00:06:00.270 want
00:06:00.450 any

00:06:00.690 hunks
00:06:01.050 of

00:06:01.470 in
00:06:01.590 there
00:06:01.800 with

00:06:03.750 at
00:06:03.870 everything
00:06:04.140 and
00:06:04.970 then
00:06:05.970 the

00:06:06.090 lemon
00:06:06.450 juice
00:06:06.630 the
