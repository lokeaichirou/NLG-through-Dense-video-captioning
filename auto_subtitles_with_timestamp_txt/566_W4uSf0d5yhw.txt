00:03:54.910 to
00:03:55.000 have
00:03:55.209 you're

00:03:55.510 going
00:03:55.660 to
00:03:55.750 want
00:03:55.900 to
00:03:55.989 give
00:03:56.980 the
00:03:57.720 mixture
00:03:59.310 let
00:04:00.310 it

00:04:00.459 mix
00:04:00.670 for
00:04:00.880 I'd
00:04:01.600 say
00:04:01.660 about
00:04:02.019 two
00:04:02.320 minutes
00:04:02.730 before

00:04:03.730 stirring
00:04:04.690 it
00:04:05.049 or
00:04:05.230 combining
00:04:05.650 it

00:04:11.230 when
00:04:12.230 it's
00:04:12.379 being
00:04:12.560 processed
00:04:13.000 the
00:04:14.000 Tajin
00:04:14.510 egg

00:04:14.780 makes
00:04:15.709 it
00:04:15.890 a
00:04:15.980 little
00:04:16.160 bit
00:04:16.340 thicker
00:04:16.729 so
00:04:17.139 again

00:04:18.139 depending
00:04:18.560 on
00:04:18.680 the
00:04:18.769 consistency
00:04:19.100 you
00:04:19.970 can
00:04:20.150 add

00:04:20.299 a
00:04:20.329 little
00:04:20.630 bit
00:04:20.810 of
00:04:20.930 water
00:04:21.290 to
00:04:21.440 it
00:04:21.650 a
00:04:21.799 couple

00:04:21.949 tablespoons
00:04:22.520 I'm
00:04:23.300 going
00:04:23.510 to
00:04:23.570 finish

00:04:23.750 processing
00:04:23.960 this
00:04:24.470 and
00:04:24.680 then
00:04:24.800 decide
00:04:25.160 on
00:04:25.190 that

00:04:31.360 all
00:04:32.360 right
00:04:32.570 just
00:04:32.840 remove
00:04:33.110 the
00:04:33.260 top
00:04:33.470 and
00:04:33.919 with
00:04:34.729 a

00:04:34.760 spatula
00:04:35.210 don't
00:04:36.110 use
00:04:36.320 any
00:04:37.090 metal
00:04:38.090 spoons
00:04:38.570 or

00:04:38.810 anything
00:04:39.139 plastic
00:04:39.410 spatula
00:04:39.800 you
00:04:40.490 can
00:04:41.120 check

00:04:41.780 the
00:04:41.930 consistency
00:04:42.320 of
00:04:42.710 it
00:04:42.950 let
00:04:43.580 me
00:04:43.669 show
00:04:44.090 you

00:04:44.800 see
00:04:45.800 right
00:04:45.979 there
00:04:46.250 it's
00:04:47.240 a
00:04:47.330 little
00:04:47.600 bit
00:04:47.780 thick

00:04:48.320 I
00:04:48.710 think
00:04:49.460 I'm
00:04:49.550 going
00:04:49.669 to
00:04:49.729 add
00:04:49.880 maybe
00:04:50.780 two

00:04:51.200 tablespoons
00:04:51.380 of
00:04:52.130 cold
00:04:53.060 water
00:04:54.040 just
00:04:55.040 helps
00:04:55.340 the

00:04:55.430 texture
00:05:05.020 again
00:05:06.020 you
00:05:06.199 still
00:05:06.470 have
00:05:06.680 that
00:05:06.949 fourth

00:05:07.789 cup
00:05:08.090 of
00:05:08.330 yogurt
00:05:09.199 left
00:05:09.470 over

00:05:10.160 we're
00:05:10.460 going

00:05:10.580 to
00:05:10.639 give
00:05:10.760 this
00:05:10.850 a
00:05:10.910 taste
00:05:11.240 and
00:05:11.479 see
00:05:11.630 what
00:05:11.780 else

00:05:11.900 it
00:05:12.050 needs

00:05:21.580 needs
00:05:22.580 a
00:05:22.699 little
00:05:22.850 bit
00:05:23.060 more
00:05:23.180 lemon
00:05:23.919 what
00:05:24.919 you

00:05:25.100 can
00:05:25.370 do
00:05:25.669 you
00:05:26.360 can
00:05:26.509 see
00:05:26.660 that
00:05:26.840 your
00:05:26.960 consistency

00:05:27.860 is
00:05:27.979 right
00:05:28.370 you
00:05:29.120 don't
00:05:29.240 want
00:05:29.419 to
00:05:29.479 make
00:05:29.569 it
00:05:29.750 more

00:05:29.900 watery
00:05:30.430 you

00:05:32.630 acid

00:05:33.289 citric
00:05:34.220 acid
00:05:34.699 is
00:05:34.910 I
00:05:35.300 guess

00:05:35.930 form
00:05:36.590 of
00:05:37.630 lemon

00:05:45.919 be

00:05:46.009 too
00:05:46.250 lemony
