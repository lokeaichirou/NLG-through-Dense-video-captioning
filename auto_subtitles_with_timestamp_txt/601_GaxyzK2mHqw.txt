00:00:02.560 when
00:00:02.720 you're
00:00:02.879 making
00:00:03.199 a
00:00:03.280 grilled
00:00:03.679 cheese

00:00:04.640 if
00:00:04.720 you're
00:00:04.960 using
00:00:05.520 thick
00:00:05.759 slices
00:00:06.319 of
00:00:06.480 cheese

00:00:07.279 and
00:00:07.359 you're
00:00:07.600 putting
00:00:07.919 butter
00:00:08.320 directly
00:00:08.960 in

00:00:09.040 the
00:00:09.280 pan

00:00:10.639 you're
00:00:10.880 doing
00:00:11.200 it
00:00:11.440 all
00:00:11.759 wrong

00:00:14.000 these
00:00:14.240 days
00:00:14.559 a
00:00:14.639 lot
00:00:14.799 of
00:00:14.960 people
00:00:15.200 buy
00:00:15.440 cheeses

00:00:15.839 in
00:00:15.920 big
00:00:16.240 blocks
00:00:16.720 and
00:00:16.800 then
00:00:16.960 they
00:00:17.119 slice
00:00:17.520 it
00:00:17.600 to

00:00:17.760 make
00:00:17.920 the
00:00:18.000 grilled
00:00:18.320 cheese

00:00:18.880 the
00:00:19.039 problem
00:00:19.359 with
00:00:19.520 that
00:00:19.760 is
00:00:19.920 that
00:00:20.000 the
00:00:20.160 thick

00:00:20.480 cheese
00:00:20.800 slices
00:00:21.279 don't
00:00:21.520 have
00:00:21.680 a
00:00:21.840 chance
00:00:22.160 to

00:00:22.320 melt
00:00:22.720 before
00:00:23.119 the
00:00:23.279 bread
00:00:23.680 burns

00:00:24.720 some
00:00:24.960 people
00:00:25.279 think
00:00:25.439 that
00:00:25.680 slicing
00:00:26.080 their

00:00:26.240 bread
00:00:26.640 really
00:00:27.039 thick
00:00:27.199 for
00:00:27.359 a
00:00:27.519 grilled
00:00:27.760 cheese

00:00:28.640 is
00:00:28.800 going
00:00:28.880 to
00:00:28.960 make
00:00:29.199 it
00:00:29.359 taste
00:00:29.599 better
00:00:30.080 but

00:00:30.320 it's
00:00:30.560 not
00:00:30.880 because
00:00:31.199 what
00:00:31.439 happens
00:00:31.840 is
00:00:32.079 you

00:00:32.239 have
00:00:32.399 a
00:00:32.559 lot
00:00:32.719 of
00:00:32.800 bread

00:00:33.280 and
00:00:33.440 not
00:00:33.680 very
00:00:33.920 much
00:00:34.239 cheese
00:00:35.040 and
00:00:35.200 this
00:00:35.440 is
00:00:35.680 a

00:00:35.840 grilled
00:00:36.160 cheese
00:00:36.480 sandwich

00:00:37.280 most
00:00:37.600 people
00:00:37.920 put
00:00:38.079 butter
00:00:38.480 directly
00:00:39.200 into
00:00:39.440 the

00:00:39.680 pan
00:00:40.079 the
00:00:40.320 problem
00:00:40.640 with
00:00:40.879 that

00:00:41.280 is
00:00:41.440 that
00:00:41.600 the
00:00:41.760 bread
00:00:42.320 ends
00:00:42.559 up
00:00:42.719 being
00:00:43.120 splotchy

00:00:43.840 and
00:00:44.079 not
00:00:44.399 evenly
00:00:44.800 coated
00:00:45.200 with
00:00:45.360 butter
00:00:45.760 which

00:00:46.000 doesn't
00:00:46.239 make
00:00:46.399 the
00:00:46.559 sandwich
00:00:46.879 taste
00:00:47.200 very

00:00:48.079 worst
00:00:48.480 of
00:00:48.640 all

00:01:26.479 butter
00:01:26.799 the
00:01:26.960 bread
00:01:27.600 make

00:01:27.840 sure
00:01:28.159 the

00:01:42.159 box

00:01:42.479 grater
00:01:42.960 and
00:01:43.119 it
00:01:43.200 will
00:01:43.360 melt
00:01:43.600 before
00:01:44.000 your

00:01:44.159 bread
00:01:44.560 has
00:01:44.720 a
00:01:44.799 chance
00:01:45.119 to
00:01:45.280 burn

00:01:46.159 cover
00:01:46.479 the

00:01:49.200 look
00:01:49.360 like

00:01:49.600 a
00:01:49.680 lot
00:01:49.920 but
00:01:50.079 once
00:01:50.320 you
00:01:50.479 start
00:01:50.720 cooking
00:01:51.040 it

00:01:51.280 it
00:01:51.360 will

00:01:59.280 of
00:01:59.360 the

00:02:01.280 won't
00:02:01.520 burn

00:02:01.840 while
00:02:02.079 your
00:02:02.320 cheese
00:02:02.640 is

00:02:17.599 of
00:02:17.680 the

00:02:17.840 cheese
00:02:18.160 starting
