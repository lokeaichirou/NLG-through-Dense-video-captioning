00:01:17.070 all
00:01:17.220 moving

00:01:18.180 while
00:01:18.299 we
00:01:18.390 put

00:01:19.020 to
00:01:19.170 help
00:01:19.320 its
00:01:19.439 steel

00:01:19.710 concentrate
00:01:20.610 on
00:01:20.790 our
00:01:20.970 muscles
00:01:21.450 now
00:01:21.680 these
00:01:22.680 are

00:01:23.040 not
00:01:23.189 those
00:01:23.310 ones
00:01:23.610 Chapa
00:01:24.479 SHhhh
00:01:24.680 so
00:01:25.680 some

00:01:26.100 people
00:01:26.220 get
00:01:26.400 a
00:01:26.460 bit
00:01:26.580 concerned
00:01:26.909 by
00:01:27.119 which
00:01:27.450 ones

00:01:27.689 they
00:01:27.840 can
00:01:28.080 and
00:01:28.259 can't
00:01:28.470 eat
00:01:28.619 unless
00:01:28.860 it's
00:01:29.130 very

00:01:29.280 very
00:01:29.610 simple
00:01:30.000 if
00:01:30.270 there
00:01:30.570 are
00:01:30.659 any
00:01:30.780 that
00:01:30.930 are

00:01:31.049 broken
00:01:31.320 it's
00:01:32.159 not
00:01:32.310 worth
00:01:32.460 him
00:01:32.640 he's
00:01:32.729 probably

00:01:32.850 alive
00:01:33.299 but
00:01:33.630 for
00:01:33.689 the
00:01:33.840 sake
00:01:33.990 of
00:01:34.020 a
00:01:34.439 broken
00:01:35.070 bit

00:01:35.189 which
00:01:35.310 might
00:01:35.520 get
00:01:35.610 shot
00:01:35.880 of
00:01:36.060 shell
00:01:36.270 in
00:01:36.299 there

00:01:36.509 just
00:01:36.930 get
00:01:37.049 rid
00:01:37.110 of
00:01:37.200 it
00:01:37.290 they're
00:01:37.439 really
00:01:37.710 cheap

00:01:37.890 that's
00:01:38.189 what
00:01:38.369 we
00:01:38.430 do
00:01:38.549 so
00:01:38.759 if
00:01:39.000 you
00:01:39.030 can
00:01:39.180 just

00:01:39.240 pick
00:01:39.570 through
00:01:39.750 those
00:01:39.930 some
00:01:40.409 for
00:01:40.500 instance

00:01:40.530 this
00:01:40.829 one's
00:01:41.009 really
00:01:41.159 close
00:01:41.460 satisfying
00:01:42.000 the

00:01:42.090 chance
00:01:42.329 that's
00:01:42.630 alive
00:01:42.869 it's
00:01:43.079 just
00:01:43.229 shut
00:01:43.409 up

00:01:43.590 okay
00:01:44.070 inflator
00:01:44.579 on
00:01:44.790 when
00:01:44.939 we've
00:01:45.060 cooked
00:01:45.210 it

00:01:45.450 it's
00:01:45.750 still
00:01:45.960 closed

00:01:46.470 then
00:01:46.649 we
00:01:46.770 won't
00:01:46.979 try
00:01:47.130 and
00:01:47.250 force
00:01:47.430 it
00:01:47.549 open

00:01:47.610 depending
00:01:48.240 on
00:01:48.479 what
00:01:48.600 time
00:01:48.840 of
00:01:48.869 year
00:01:48.990 you
00:01:49.229 get

00:01:49.560 your
00:01:49.680 muscles
00:01:49.860 they
00:01:50.220 will
00:01:50.369 have
00:01:50.460 lots
00:01:50.909 of

00:01:51.000 beard
00:01:51.240 or
00:01:51.390 less
00:01:51.600 so
00:01:51.840 it
00:01:52.290 tends
00:01:52.530 to
00:01:52.619 be
00:01:52.799 a
00:01:53.040 factor

00:01:53.700 of
00:01:53.759 the
00:01:53.820 seasons
00:01:54.210 and
00:01:54.750 just
00:01:54.899 get
00:01:55.020 stuck
00:01:55.200 in

00:01:55.350 there
00:01:55.530 I'll
00:01:55.979 let
00:01:56.130 the
00:01:56.310 Mojo

00:01:57.530 not
00:01:58.530 quite
00:01:58.920 your
00:01:59.159 beard
00:01:59.399 so
00:02:00.000 if
00:02:00.060 you
00:02:00.149 could

00:02:00.270 just
00:02:00.360 finish
00:02:00.509 up
00:02:00.689 62
00:02:01.170 those
00:02:01.530 because
00:02:01.890 the
00:02:02.009 rest

00:02:02.159 of
00:02:02.220 my
00:02:02.310 pan
00:02:02.549 is
00:02:02.579 nearly
00:02:02.970 ready
00:02:03.060 ok
00:02:03.810 we've
00:02:03.990 fried

00:02:04.290 those
00:02:04.530 off
00:02:04.770 at
00:02:05.009 which
00:02:05.159 point
00:02:05.430 we
00:02:05.549 can
00:02:05.700 add
00:02:05.880 in

00:02:06.149 our
00:02:06.329 coconut
00:02:06.930 milk
00:02:07.110 so
00:02:07.590 holding
00:02:07.979 the
00:02:08.039 coconut

00:02:08.399 milk
00:02:08.550 and
00:02:08.700 that's
00:02:08.880 just
00:02:09.030 going
00:02:09.149 to
00:02:09.239 bubble

00:02:09.539 away
00:02:09.599 in
00:02:09.959 there
00:02:10.370 and
00:02:11.370 that's
00:02:11.489 essentially

00:02:11.910 what's
00:02:12.030 going
00:02:12.090 to
00:02:12.270 cook
00:02:12.510 and
00:02:12.780 steam
00:02:13.050 all
00:02:13.349 of

00:02:13.590 our
00:02:13.680 muscles
00:02:14.069 and
00:02:14.250 becomes
00:02:14.430 a
00:02:14.489 great
00:02:14.730 sauce
00:02:15.000 to
