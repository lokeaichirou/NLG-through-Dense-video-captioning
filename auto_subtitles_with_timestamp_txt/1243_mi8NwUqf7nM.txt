00:00:08.510 so
00:00:09.510 she
00:00:09.570 is
00:00:09.900 originally
00:00:10.769 a
00:00:10.920 nigiri
00:00:11.340 style

00:00:11.759 which
00:00:12.300 is
00:00:12.509 sliced
00:00:12.929 fish
00:00:13.230 on
00:00:13.469 top
00:00:13.769 of
00:00:13.980 rice

00:00:14.450 therefore
00:00:15.450 learning
00:00:15.990 how
00:00:16.260 to
00:00:16.320 slice
00:00:16.770 and

00:00:17.039 prepare
00:00:17.520 the
00:00:17.760 pieces
00:00:18.119 of
00:00:18.270 fish
00:00:18.449 is
00:00:18.720 very

00:00:19.109 important
00:00:19.680 more
00:00:19.920 than
00:00:20.189 anything
00:00:20.369 else
00:00:20.670 this

00:00:21.660 video
00:00:22.050 is
00:00:22.260 showing
00:00:22.590 how
00:00:22.859 to
00:00:22.890 do
00:00:23.220 this
00:00:23.430 task

00:00:25.189 prior
00:00:26.189 to
00:00:26.220 slicing
00:00:26.760 the
00:00:27.060 fish
00:00:27.090 for
00:00:27.510 nigiri

00:00:27.869 sushi
00:00:27.960 you
00:00:28.949 will
00:00:29.099 need
00:00:29.279 to
00:00:29.429 break
00:00:29.670 down
00:00:29.699 and

00:00:30.210 trim
00:00:30.480 the
00:00:30.630 fillet
00:00:30.869 to
00:00:31.349 make
00:00:31.529 it
00:00:31.679 the
00:00:31.830 best
00:00:32.040 size

00:00:32.309 to
00:00:32.700 slice
00:00:32.940 off
00:00:33.800 cutting
00:00:34.800 a
00:00:35.040 big
00:00:35.250 fish
00:00:35.550 into

00:00:36.030 smaller
00:00:36.329 blocks
00:00:36.570 is
00:00:36.960 known
00:00:37.380 as
00:00:37.620 Sokka
00:00:38.040 Dory

00:00:38.370 which
00:00:39.149 makes
00:00:39.390 it
00:00:39.570 easier
00:00:39.960 to
00:00:40.050 slice
00:00:40.530 into

00:00:40.860 pieces
00:00:41.780 also
00:00:42.780 what's
00:00:43.290 the
00:00:43.410 video
00:00:43.620 about
00:00:43.770 how

00:00:44.340 to
00:00:44.370 break
00:00:44.820 down
00:00:45.030 the
00:00:45.300 whole
00:00:45.329 fish
00:00:45.809 for
00:00:46.200 more
00:00:46.469 in

00:00:46.590 detail
00:00:47.480 the
00:00:48.480 majority
00:00:49.050 of
00:00:49.079 the
00:00:49.320 nigiri

00:00:49.620 recipes
00:00:50.340 requires
00:00:51.090 slices
00:00:52.079 of
00:00:52.230 fish
00:00:52.440 which

00:00:53.190 are
00:00:53.460 about
00:00:53.730 3
00:00:54.090 inch
00:00:54.329 long
00:00:54.629 1
00:00:55.170 inch
00:00:55.379 wide
00:00:55.710 and

00:00:55.980 quarter
00:00:56.760 inch
00:00:56.940 thick
00:00:57.800 but
00:00:58.800 judge
00:00:59.160 yourself

00:00:59.699 when
00:01:00.300 it
00:01:00.420 comes
00:01:00.660 to
00:01:00.899 how
00:01:01.170 thick
00:01:01.500 you
00:01:01.800 want
00:01:01.829 to

00:01:02.100 cut
00:01:02.309 for
00:01:03.300 example
00:01:03.780 if
00:01:03.989 the
00:01:04.320 fish
00:01:04.530 is
00:01:04.710 chewy

00:01:05.010 thinner
00:01:05.850 slice
00:01:06.210 will
00:01:06.630 be
00:01:06.750 better
00:01:06.960 if
00:01:07.650 it's

00:01:08.580 very
00:01:08.820 tender
00:01:09.180 cut
00:01:09.900 it
00:01:10.020 thicker
00:01:10.260 to
00:01:10.740 take
00:01:11.010 the

00:01:11.189 advantage
00:01:11.700 of
00:01:11.880 the
00:01:12.180 texture
00:01:12.570 of
00:01:12.600 the
00:01:12.840 material

00:01:19.430 all
00:01:20.430 the
00:01:20.790 fish
00:01:21.000 has
00:01:21.390 the
00:01:21.420 grain
00:01:21.869 within
00:01:22.409 its

00:01:22.590 meat
00:01:23.750 when
00:01:24.750 you
00:01:24.840 slice
00:01:25.140 off
00:01:25.380 basically
00:01:26.190 you

00:01:26.670 need
00:01:26.820 to
00:01:26.880 cut
00:01:27.180 against
00:01:27.690 the
00:01:27.720 grain

00:01:29.570 if
00:01:30.570 you
00:01:30.750 cut
00:01:30.960 with
00:01:31.229 the
00:01:31.380 grain
00:01:31.560 the
00:01:32.220 whole
00:01:32.460 long

00:01:32.850 grain
00:01:33.210 will
00:01:33.509 stays
00:01:33.780 in
00:01:34.080 a
00:01:34.170 piece
00:01:34.380 of
00:01:34.560 sliced

00:01:34.950 fish
00:01:35.280 which
00:01:36.030 makes
00:01:36.300 it
00:01:36.479 chewy
00:01:36.690 especially
00:01:37.560 if

00:01:37.680 it's
00:01:37.860 a
00:01:37.979 hard
00:01:38.009 senior
00:01:38.700 like
00:01:38.940 in
00:01:39.119 tuna
00:01:40.280 so

00:01:41.280 trying
00:01:41.640 to
00:01:41.759 cut
00:01:41.970 across
00:01:42.300 the
00:01:42.570 grain
00:01:42.810 so
00:01:43.350 that

00:01:43.380 the
00:01:43.710 short
00:01:43.979 pieces
00:01:44.190 of
00:01:44.490 tissue
00:01:44.700 is
00:01:45.030 connected

00:01:45.600 to
00:01:45.630 the
00:01:45.869 grain
00:01:46.110 which
00:01:46.560 makes
00:01:46.830 it
00:01:46.979 nicer

00:01:47.430 texture
00:01:54.380 the
00:01:55.380 exception
00:01:55.830 can
00:01:55.979 be
00:01:56.039 set
00:01:56.399 only

00:01:56.550 for
00:01:57.060 the
00:01:57.179 fish
00:01:57.390 with
00:01:57.869 softer
00:01:58.380 and
00:01:58.560 fragile

00:01:59.070 flesh
00:01:59.810 if
00:02:00.810 you
00:02:00.990 cut
00:02:01.200 against
00:02:01.560 the
00:02:01.619 grain
00:02:01.740 the

00:02:02.520 meat
00:02:02.729 can
00:02:02.940 be
00:02:03.000 easily
00:02:03.390 broken
00:02:03.630 apart

00:02:04.440 so
00:02:04.830 in
00:02:05.009 that
00:02:05.130 case
00:02:05.399 cut
00:02:06.270 with
00:02:06.570 the
00:02:06.720 grain
00:02:06.899 to

00:02:07.500 help
00:02:07.740 the
00:02:07.890 tissue
00:02:08.100 keep
00:02:08.519 firmly
00:02:08.789 attached

00:02:09.619 when
00:02:10.619 you
00:02:10.709 slice
00:02:11.009 off
00:02:11.220 the
00:02:11.250 block
00:02:11.640 with
00:02:11.970 the

00:02:12.120 opposite
00:02:12.540 direction
00:02:12.720 of
00:02:13.170 grain
00:02:13.440 you
00:02:14.070 will
00:02:14.220 be

00:02:14.310 harder
00:02:14.640 to
00:02:14.850 cut
00:02:15.090 if
00:02:15.480 you
00:02:15.540 change
00:02:15.959 the

00:02:16.080 direction
00:02:16.260 of
00:02:16.530 your
00:02:16.769 knife
00:02:17.010 so
00:02:17.850 change
00:02:18.209 the

00:02:18.269 direction
00:02:18.540 of
00:02:18.900 the
00:02:19.200 fish
00:02:19.410 instead

00:02:30.330 place
00:02:31.330 the
00:02:31.510 block
00:02:31.720 with
00:02:32.170 the
00:02:32.200 skin
00:02:32.530 side
00:02:32.740 down

00:02:36.680 the
00:02:37.680 tail-end
00:02:37.950 usually
00:02:38.730 has
00:02:38.970 more
00:02:39.240 senior
00:02:39.600 so

00:02:40.110 if
00:02:40.350 it
00:02:40.590 is
00:02:40.740 too
00:02:40.980 chewy

00:02:41.550 chop
00:02:41.820 it
00:02:42.030 off
00:02:46.670 starting
00:02:47.670 from
00:02:47.880 the
00:02:48.060 tail
00:02:48.270 end

00:02:48.510 use
00:02:49.230 your
00:02:49.440 knife
00:02:49.620 to
00:02:49.650 determine
00:02:50.430 the
00:02:50.550 angles

00:02:51.000 to
00:02:51.240 adjust
00:02:51.630 the
00:02:51.750 desired
00:02:52.110 size
00:02:56.630 when
00:02:57.630 you

00:02:57.660 stand
00:02:58.050 the
00:02:58.200 blade
00:02:58.440 up
00:02:58.620 it
00:02:59.400 will
00:02:59.580 make
00:02:59.730 a

00:02:59.760 narrower
00:03:00.300 piece

00:03:06.660 if
00:03:07.660 the
00:03:07.900 blade
00:03:08.110 is
00:03:08.140 flattened
00:03:08.830 it
00:03:09.460 will
00:03:09.700 make

00:03:09.880 the
00:03:10.060 wider
00:03:10.330 piece

00:03:20.990 on
00:03:21.440 the
00:03:22.220 other
00:03:22.310 hand
00:03:22.610 when
00:03:23.360 you
00:03:23.480 set
00:03:23.660 the
00:03:23.780 knife

00:03:23.990 blade
00:03:24.290 in
00:03:24.470 arrow
00:03:24.650 to
00:03:24.980 the
00:03:25.100 cutting
00:03:25.370 edge
00:03:25.520 you

00:03:26.330 will
00:03:26.450 slice
00:03:26.750 the
00:03:26.930 shorter
00:03:27.290 piece
00:03:27.670 if
00:03:28.670 he
00:03:28.850 said

00:03:29.090 wider
00:03:29.420 it
00:03:30.080 will
00:03:30.290 make
00:03:30.410 the
00:03:30.560 piece
00:03:30.800 longer

00:03:56.650 the
00:03:57.280 width
00:03:57.519 and
00:03:57.730 the
00:03:57.790 thickness
00:03:58.060 of
00:03:58.659 the

00:03:59.170 trains
00:03:59.440 block
00:03:59.769 are
00:04:00.069 not
00:04:00.340 always
00:04:00.549 even
00:04:01.180 all
00:04:01.330 the

00:04:01.659 way
00:04:01.690 to
00:04:01.870 the
00:04:02.170 end
00:04:02.319 so
00:04:02.680 you
00:04:03.489 need
00:04:03.819 to

00:04:04.000 continually
00:04:04.720 adjust
00:04:05.080 the
00:04:05.200 angles
00:04:05.620 as
00:04:05.799 you

00:04:14.650 make
00:04:15.650 the
00:04:15.799 initial
00:04:16.250 cut
00:04:16.489 using
00:04:16.940 the
00:04:17.120 full

00:04:17.389 length
00:04:17.690 of
00:04:17.930 the
00:04:18.169 blade
00:04:18.380 from
00:04:19.040 the
00:04:19.190 heel
00:04:19.400 to
00:04:19.430 the

00:04:19.820 tip
00:04:20.030 in
00:04:20.600 one
00:04:20.900 motion
00:04:21.760 once
00:04:22.760 the
00:04:22.940 knife
00:04:23.120 almost

00:04:23.570 reached
00:04:23.840 the
00:04:24.020 skin
00:04:24.290 side
00:04:24.530 stand
00:04:25.460 at
00:04:25.639 the
00:04:25.790 blade

00:04:26.030 to
00:04:26.389 cut
00:04:26.600 straight
00:04:26.960 down
00:04:34.090 this
00:04:35.090 motion
00:04:35.539 creates

00:04:36.110 the
00:04:36.260 deeper
00:04:36.620 cutting
00:04:37.100 edge
00:04:37.280 which
00:04:37.789 looks

00:05:02.300 the
00:05:03.300 more
00:05:03.510 you
00:05:03.660 practice
00:05:04.140 the
00:05:04.560 more
00:05:04.590 evenly

00:05:05.130 you
00:05:05.430 will
00:05:05.550 be
00:05:05.670 able
00:05:05.790 to
00:05:05.970 cut
00:05:06.300 off
00:05:06.450 each
00:05:06.750 slice

00:05:07.080 of
00:05:07.110 piece
