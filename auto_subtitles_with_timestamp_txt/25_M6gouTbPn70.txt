00:00:40.500 okay
00:00:41.100 which
00:00:41.910 is
00:00:42.030 pretty

00:00:42.180 standard
00:00:42.390 ratio
00:00:42.809 an
00:00:43.320 egg
00:00:43.649 and
00:00:43.890 then

00:00:44.040 buttermilk
00:00:44.579 behind
00:00:44.879 it
00:00:45.120 it's
00:00:45.510 also
00:00:45.750 got

00:00:46.050 playful

00:00:48.840 that
00:00:49.110 plenty
00:00:49.680 is
00:00:49.920 cornmeal

00:00:50.489 you
00:00:50.730 know
00:00:50.789 that's
00:00:50.940 where
00:00:51.149 the
00:00:51.239 corn
00:00:51.420 comes

00:00:51.629 from

00:00:52.110 but
00:00:52.530 not
00:00:52.800 enough
00:00:53.129 so
00:00:53.399 I

00:00:55.800 of
00:00:55.890 sweet
00:00:56.070 corn
00:00:56.210 so
00:00:57.210 the
00:00:57.329 sweet
00:00:57.510 corn
00:00:57.719 is
