00:00:22.470 alright

00:00:22.740 I'll
00:00:22.949 admit
00:00:23.220 we
00:00:23.340 really
00:00:23.580 don't
00:00:23.670 do
00:00:23.820 this
00:00:23.970 to

00:00:24.150 save
00:00:24.330 money
00:00:24.539 the
00:00:24.930 real
00:00:25.109 reason
00:00:25.439 is
00:00:25.500 so
00:00:25.650 our

00:00:25.769 foodie
00:00:26.160 friends
00:00:26.340 think
00:00:26.789 we're
00:00:26.939 a
00:00:26.970 badass
00:00:27.420 so

00:00:28.170 we're
00:00:28.260 going
00:00:28.349 to
00:00:28.410 get
00:00:28.529 started
00:00:28.769 and
00:00:29.070 the
00:00:29.189 first

00:00:29.429 thing
00:00:29.580 we
00:00:29.699 need
00:00:29.910 is
00:00:30.150 the
00:00:30.359 brine
00:00:30.689 so
00:00:31.650 into
00:00:31.890 a

00:00:31.920 bowl
00:00:32.009 I'm
00:00:32.340 gonna
00:00:32.460 pour
00:00:32.640 some
00:00:32.850 fresh
00:00:33.149 cold

00:00:33.510 water
00:00:33.600 yes
00:00:34.469 we're
00:00:34.710 using
00:00:34.800 fresh
00:00:35.190 water
00:00:35.430 this

00:00:35.610 time
00:00:35.670 and
00:00:36.059 then
00:00:36.690 to
00:00:36.840 that
00:00:36.960 we're
00:00:37.079 going
00:00:37.170 to
00:00:37.230 add

00:00:37.350 a
00:00:37.380 whole
00:00:37.620 bunch
00:00:37.829 of
00:00:37.980 kosher
00:00:38.190 salt
00:00:38.370 and
00:00:38.940 a

00:00:39.780 fairly
00:00:40.050 decent
00:00:40.410 amount
00:00:40.829 of
00:00:40.980 white
00:00:41.160 sugar
00:00:41.399 and

00:00:41.579 we're
00:00:42.540 going
00:00:42.660 to
00:00:42.690 go
00:00:42.809 ahead
00:00:42.960 and
00:00:43.050 give
00:00:43.170 that
00:00:43.200 a

00:00:43.350 stir
00:00:43.469 until
00:00:43.980 it's
00:00:44.280 completely
00:00:44.730 dissolved
00:00:45.030 and

00:00:45.690 sure
00:00:46.230 this
00:00:46.440 would
00:00:46.620 be
00:00:46.710 quicker
00:00:46.920 if
00:00:47.010 we
00:00:47.129 used

00:00:47.309 hot
00:00:47.520 water
00:00:47.550 but
00:00:48.360 then
00:00:48.480 our
00:00:48.600 water
00:00:48.780 would
00:00:48.989 have

00:00:49.110 been
00:00:49.260 cold
00:00:49.469 and
00:00:49.680 fresh
00:00:49.950 but
00:00:50.820 anyway
00:00:51.059 no

00:00:51.210 worries
00:00:51.510 because
00:00:51.600 after
00:00:51.930 a
00:00:51.960 couple
00:00:52.110 minutes

00:00:52.260 of
00:00:52.530 stirring
00:00:52.710 that
00:00:53.579 cloudiness
00:00:53.969 will

00:00:54.239 disappear
00:00:54.840 and
00:00:55.140 it
00:00:55.530 will
00:00:55.559 look
00:00:55.739 like
00:00:55.800 water

00:00:56.190 again
00:00:56.550 and
00:00:56.789 in
00:00:57.390 the
00:00:57.480 business
00:00:57.809 we
00:00:57.989 refer
00:00:58.289 to

00:00:58.320 this
00:00:58.500 as
00:00:58.559 a
00:00:58.710 moment
00:00:59.190 of
00:00:59.340 clarity
00:00:59.579 and
00:01:00.539 once

00:01:00.870 your
00:01:00.989 brine
00:01:01.170 looks
00:01:01.410 like
00:01:01.590 that
00:01:01.770 simply
00:01:02.160 set
00:01:02.399 it

00:01:02.489 aside
00:01:02.629 while
00:01:03.629 we
00:01:03.660 move
00:01:03.899 on
00:01:04.080 to
00:01:04.290 prep

00:01:07.320 piece

00:01:07.500 salmon
00:01:07.680 and
00:01:08.100 it
00:01:08.610 should

00:01:08.790 still
00:01:09.000 have
00:01:09.119 the
00:01:09.240 skin

00:02:05.280 trim
00:02:05.610 away
00:02:05.729 and
00:02:06.090 then
00:02:06.450 once
00:02:06.689 any

00:02:06.840 fine-tuning
00:02:07.469 trimming
00:02:07.860 is
00:02:07.920 done
00:02:08.099 we're
00:02:08.700 just

00:02:08.729 going
00:02:09.090 to
00:02:09.149 turn
00:02:09.300 that
00:02:09.360 piece
00:02:09.690 this
00:02:09.899 way
00:02:10.110 and

00:02:10.440 carefully
00:02:11.340 cut
00:02:11.580 about
00:02:12.030 quarter
00:02:12.750 inch
00:02:13.020 thick

00:02:14.490 and
00:02:14.610 obviously
00:02:14.790 you
00:02:15.120 can
00:02:15.240 cut
00:02:15.390 them
00:02:15.450 thinner

00:02:15.690 if
00:02:15.900 you
00:02:15.990 want
00:02:16.200 or
00:02:16.410 thicker
00:02:16.620 if
00:02:16.830 you
00:02:16.950 want
00:02:17.130 but

00:02:17.550 if
00:02:17.640 you
00:02:17.700 want
00:02:17.880 to
00:02:17.940 use
00:02:18.060 my
00:02:18.240 briny
00:02:18.570 times
00:02:19.020 it's

00:02:19.590 going
00:02:19.740 to
00:02:19.800 be
00:02:19.890 kind
00:02:20.070 of
00:02:20.100 important
00:02:20.490 you
00:02:20.550 get
00:02:20.670 it

00:02:20.760 similar
00:02:21.090 so
00:02:21.540 I'm
00:02:21.600 going
00:02:21.720 to
00:02:21.780 continue
00:02:21.990 to

00:02:22.140 slice
00:02:22.410 that
00:02:22.620 across
00:02:22.920 and
00:02:23.310 once
00:02:23.940 our
00:02:24.090 salmon

00:02:24.360 has
00:02:24.630 been
00:02:24.780 sliced
00:02:25.110 it's
00:02:26.040 time
00:02:26.310 to
00:02:26.460 brine
00:02:26.760 and
00:02:27.540 I

00:02:27.660 like
00:02:27.780 to
00:02:27.870 do
00:02:27.990 5
00:02:28.230 or
00:02:28.350 6
00:02:28.500 pieces
00:02:28.830 at
00:02:28.950 a
00:02:29.040 time
00:02:29.070 I

00:02:29.640 mean
00:02:30.030 I
00:02:30.090 could
00:02:30.240 probably
00:02:30.420 get
00:02:30.570 more
00:02:30.750 in
00:02:30.840 here

00:02:31.080 but
00:02:31.440 I
00:02:31.470 know
00:02:31.560 doing
00:02:31.980 it
00:02:32.040 in
00:02:32.160 batches
00:02:32.340 works

00:02:32.730 great
00:02:33.000 so
00:02:33.270 better
00:02:33.540 safe
00:02:33.750 than
00:02:33.900 sorry
00:02:33.980 are
00:02:34.980 you

00:02:35.040 want
00:02:35.250 to
00:02:35.310 be
00:02:35.370 sure
00:02:35.520 about
00:02:35.550 the
00:02:35.910 cure
00:02:36.150 so
00:02:37.020 I'm

00:02:37.050 gonna
00:02:37.170 go
00:02:37.290 ahead
00:02:37.350 and
00:02:37.440 place
00:02:37.680 those
00:02:37.860 slices
00:02:38.100 in

00:02:38.370 the
00:02:38.460 brine
00:02:38.700 and
00:02:39.030 then
00:02:39.840 believe
00:02:40.050 it
00:02:40.140 or
00:02:40.230 not

00:02:40.320 it's
00:02:40.530 only
00:02:40.680 going
00:02:40.890 to
00:02:40.950 sit
00:02:41.130 in
00:02:41.250 there
00:02:41.430 for

00:02:41.640 three
00:02:41.940 minutes
00:02:42.180 it's
00:02:43.080 not
00:02:43.230 called
00:02:43.440 quick
00:02:43.680 here

00:02:43.920 for
00:02:44.100 nothing
00:02:44.370 so
00:02:44.550 set
00:02:45.270 your
00:02:45.390 timer
00:02:45.630 for
00:02:45.750 three

00:02:45.990 minutes
00:02:46.110 and
00:02:46.800 you
00:02:47.400 could
00:02:47.520 probably
00:02:47.670 just
00:02:48.000 let

00:02:48.120 it
00:02:48.240 sit
00:02:48.450 there
00:02:48.480 but
00:02:49.110 you
00:02:49.200 know
00:02:49.320 me
00:02:49.530 I
00:02:49.760 can't

00:02:50.760 stand
00:02:51.000 in
00:02:51.090 front
00:02:51.210 of
00:02:51.360 food
00:02:51.510 for
00:02:51.690 three
00:02:51.870 minutes

00:02:52.020 without
00:02:52.260 touching
00:02:52.560 it
00:02:52.770 so
00:02:53.580 I
00:02:53.610 do
00:02:53.730 move
00:02:54.030 mine

00:02:54.240 around
00:02:54.450 a
00:02:54.600 little
00:02:54.780 bit
00:02:54.900 like
00:02:55.740 I
00:02:55.860 said
00:02:56.040 probably

00:02:56.310 for
00:02:56.490 no
00:02:56.580 good
00:02:56.700 reason
00:02:57.060 and
00:02:57.240 then
00:02:57.930 exactly

00:02:58.380 three
00:02:58.830 minutes
00:02:58.950 later
00:02:59.310 we're
00:02:59.520 going
00:02:59.610 to
00:02:59.670 fish

00:02:59.910 those
00:03:00.150 out
00:03:00.770 onto
00:03:01.770 a
00:03:01.800 rack
00:03:02.120 although
00:03:03.120 you
00:03:03.210 could

00:03:03.330 probably
00:03:03.510 just
00:03:03.720 put
00:03:03.870 these
00:03:03.960 right
00:03:04.170 onto
00:03:04.380 paper

00:03:04.530 towels
00:03:04.890 I
00:03:05.310 just
00:03:05.790 thought
00:03:05.910 the
00:03:06.030 rack
00:03:06.210 would

00:03:06.360 look
00:03:06.510 cooler
00:03:06.720 but
00:03:07.440 anyway
00:03:07.650 we're
00:03:07.740 going
00:03:07.830 to

00:03:07.890 fish
00:03:08.070 those
00:03:08.280 out
00:03:08.520 and
00:03:09.390 once
00:03:09.570 those
00:03:09.660 have
00:03:09.840 been

00:03:09.960 removed
00:03:10.260 from
00:03:10.380 the
00:03:10.560 brine
00:03:10.800 very
00:03:11.430 important
00:03:11.970 we

00:03:12.060 need
00:03:12.090 to
00:03:12.240 Pat
00:03:12.510 those
00:03:12.690 dry
00:03:12.990 a
00:03:13.020 little
00:03:13.230 bit
00:03:13.380 so

00:03:14.280 take
00:03:14.460 a
00:03:14.490 paper
00:03:14.730 towel
00:03:15.000 and
00:03:15.030 kind
00:03:15.300 of
00:03:15.360 blot

00:03:15.540 those
00:03:15.750 off
00:03:15.960 all
00:03:16.680 right
00:03:16.770 it's
00:03:16.890 okay
00:03:17.100 if
00:03:17.190 they're

00:03:17.340 moist
00:03:17.490 you
00:03:17.820 just
00:03:18.030 don't
00:03:18.180 want
00:03:18.330 them
00:03:18.420 wet
00:03:18.600 and

00:03:18.840 then
00:03:19.410 once
00:03:19.590 all
00:03:19.680 our
00:03:19.830 salmon
00:03:20.070 slices
00:03:20.550 have

00:03:20.670 been
00:03:20.850 cured
00:03:21.270 and
00:03:21.540 patted
00:03:22.350 dry
00:03:22.470 we're
00:03:22.740 going
00:03:22.770 to

00:03:22.920 go
00:03:23.010 ahead
00:03:23.070 and
00:03:23.220 put
00:03:23.340 those
00:03:23.430 on
00:03:23.610 a
00:03:23.640 platter

00:03:23.940 we'll
00:03:24.720 go
00:03:24.840 ahead
00:03:24.930 and
00:03:25.050 wrap
00:03:25.230 that
00:03:25.440 nice
00:03:25.650 and

00:03:25.830 tight
00:03:25.980 with
00:03:26.010 plastic
00:03:26.640 and
00:03:26.790 then
00:03:27.180 to
00:03:27.300 finish

00:03:27.450 the
00:03:27.570 process
00:03:27.870 we
00:03:28.200 want
00:03:28.320 to
00:03:28.410 refrigerate
00:03:28.680 those

00:03:29.130 until
00:03:29.400 ice
00:03:29.610 cold
00:03:29.910 before
00:03:30.300 serving
00:03:30.780 I
00:03:31.170 would

00:03:31.710 say
00:03:31.830 a
00:03:31.860 minimum
00:03:32.070 of
00:03:32.430 two
00:03:32.640 to
00:03:32.670 three
00:03:32.790 hours

00:03:33.270 although
00:03:33.600 overnight
00:03:34.200 I
00:03:34.230 think's
00:03:34.740 much
00:03:34.950 better

00:03:35.340 Izzie
00:03:36.180 sit
00:03:36.450 in
00:03:36.510 the
00:03:36.600 fridge
00:03:36.810 those
00:03:37.770 slices
00:03:38.130 of

00:03:38.400 salmon
00:03:38.760 kind
00:03:38.940 of
00:03:39.000 continue
00:03:39.390 to
00:03:39.540 cure
00:03:39.840 and

00:03:40.140 you'll
00:03:40.650 even
00:03:40.770 get
00:03:40.920 a
00:03:40.980 little
00:03:41.250 more
00:03:41.340 of
00:03:41.460 a

00:03:41.520 firmer
00:03:41.730 texture
00:03:42.150 but
00:03:42.810 anyway
00:03:42.990 we're
00:03:43.080 going
00:03:43.170 to

00:03:43.260 chill
00:03:43.440 that
00:03:43.620 thoroughly
00:03:43.950 and
00:03:44.280 then
00:03:44.700 it's

00:03:44.880 ready
00:03:45.060 to
00:03:45.180 unwrap
00:03:45.720 and
00:03:45.960 use
00:03:46.230 and
00:03:46.770 look
00:03:47.400 how

00:03:47.580 beautiful
00:03:48.060 that
00:03:48.090 is
00:03:48.260 all
00:03:49.260 right
00:03:49.350 that
00:03:49.410 colors

00:03:49.890 deepened
00:03:50.400 that
00:03:51.150 textures
00:03:51.570 firmed
00:03:51.900 up
00:03:52.110 very

00:03:52.860 similar
00:03:53.250 to
00:03:53.400 a
00:03:53.430 commercial
00:03:53.790 smoked
00:03:54.210 salmon
00:03:54.690 or

00:03:54.960 gravlax
00:03:55.800 or
00:03:56.040 other
00:03:56.160 type
00:03:56.400 of
00:03:56.430 cured
00:03:56.760 salmon

00:03:56.970 and
00:03:57.660 because
00:03:57.870 of
00:03:57.900 that
00:03:58.020 salt
00:03:58.380 and
00:03:58.560 sugar
00:03:58.740 and

00:03:58.920 the
00:03:58.980 brine
00:03:59.220 it's
00:03:59.700 perfectly
00:04:00.150 seasoned
00:04:00.720 so

00:04:01.230 let's
00:04:01.350 go
00:04:01.470 ahead
00:04:01.560 and
00:04:01.650 unwrap
00:04:01.830 that
00:04:02.220 and
00:04:02.490 start

00:04:02.940 figuring
00:04:03.150 out
00:04:03.390 ways
00:04:03.540 to
00:04:03.600 eat
00:04:03.840 this
00:04:04.050 one
00:04:04.920 of
00:04:05.040 my

00:04:05.100 favorite
00:04:05.520 and
00:04:05.640 simplest
00:04:06.030 ways
00:04:06.240 is
00:04:06.270 just
00:04:06.630 to

00:04:06.780 put
00:04:06.960 a
00:04:06.990 little
00:04:07.230 bit
00:04:07.350 of
00:04:07.530 ginger
00:04:07.730 just
00:04:08.730 like
00:04:08.850 a

00:04:08.880 half
00:04:09.150 of
00:04:09.330 a
00:04:09.420 freakishly
00:04:09.870 small
00:04:10.050 wooden
00:04:10.440 spoon

00:04:10.710 just
00:04:11.100 stir
00:04:11.850 it
00:04:11.880 into
00:04:12.180 a
00:04:12.210 little
00:04:12.480 soy
00:04:12.630 sauce
00:04:12.930 and

00:04:13.380 then
00:04:13.860 just
00:04:13.920 give
00:04:14.220 that
00:04:14.370 slice
00:04:14.610 of
00:04:14.790 cured

00:04:15.030 salmon
00:04:15.180 a
