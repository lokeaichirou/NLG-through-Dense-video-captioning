00:00:21.380 out
00:00:21.680 if
00:00:21.830 you
00:00:21.980 wish

00:00:23.140 but
00:00:23.800 I
00:00:24.189 decided
00:00:25.000 to
00:00:25.990 trick
00:00:26.680 my
00:00:26.920 children
00:00:27.520 and
00:00:27.990 I

00:00:28.990 started
00:00:29.710 adding
00:00:29.949 just
00:00:30.220 a
00:00:30.400 little
00:00:30.430 bit
00:00:30.910 of

00:00:31.029 onion
00:00:31.449 and
00:00:31.660 a
00:00:31.720 little
00:00:31.750 bit
00:00:32.169 of
00:00:32.290 garlic
00:00:32.559 at
00:00:32.860 a

00:00:32.890 time
00:00:33.190 and
00:00:33.489 I
00:00:33.610 chopped
00:00:34.000 it
00:00:34.210 up
00:00:34.360 very
00:00:34.899 very
00:00:35.050 good

00:00:36.329 the
00:00:37.329 smaller
00:00:37.780 it
00:00:38.230 is
00:00:38.260 the
00:00:38.649 less
00:00:39.250 likely

00:00:39.280 they'll
00:00:40.059 notice
00:00:40.420 it
00:00:40.600 but
00:00:40.900 they
00:00:41.080 will
00:00:41.320 notice

00:00:41.739 the
00:00:41.949 flavor
00:00:42.250 and
00:00:42.579 just
00:00:43.000 think
00:00:43.269 it's
00:00:43.449 yummy
00:00:43.780 so

00:00:44.650 I
00:00:44.680 just
00:00:45.070 chop
00:00:45.400 and
00:00:45.760 chop
00:00:46.180 and
00:00:46.540 chop
00:00:46.930 until
00:00:47.920 I

00:00:48.010 feel
00:00:48.430 like
00:00:48.670 I
00:00:48.820 just
00:00:48.850 can't
00:00:49.180 chop
00:00:49.480 anymore

00:07:29.820 this
