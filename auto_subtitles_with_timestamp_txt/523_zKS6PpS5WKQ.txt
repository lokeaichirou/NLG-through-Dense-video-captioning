00:06:58.170 there
00:06:58.350 are
00:06:58.470 two
00:06:58.560 ways

00:06:58.680 to
00:06:58.920 cook
00:06:59.340 this
00:06:59.550 doll
00:06:59.930 one
00:07:00.930 is
00:07:01.140 we
00:07:01.410 can
00:07:01.590 cook
00:07:01.830 it

00:07:02.040 over
00:07:02.130 a
00:07:02.280 slow
00:07:02.640 flame
00:07:02.970 for
00:07:03.480 15
00:07:03.780 20
00:07:04.320 minute

00:07:05.000 otherwise
00:07:06.000 we
00:07:06.720 put
00:07:07.560 the
00:07:07.710 lid
00:07:07.890 back
00:07:07.920 and
00:07:08.580 cook

00:07:08.850 till
00:07:08.880 two
00:07:09.360 whistles
00:07:09.840 so
00:07:10.620 I
00:07:10.650 will
00:07:11.040 prefer
00:07:11.580 the

00:07:12.000 second
00:07:12.840 method
00:07:13.020 because
00:07:13.560 it
00:07:13.740 was
00:07:13.920 makin

00:07:14.720 faster
00:07:25.010 ok
00:07:26.010 now
00:07:26.130 after
00:07:26.370 to
00:07:27.180 the
00:07:27.360 sills
00:07:27.660 have

00:07:27.900 taken
00:07:28.290 the
00:07:28.410 lid
00:07:28.590 off
00:07:28.620 now
00:07:29.160 you
00:07:29.220 can
00:07:29.520 see
00:07:29.760 the

00:07:29.970 texture
00:07:30.360 of
00:07:30.510 the
00:07:30.960 doll
00:07:31.250 it's
00:07:32.250 a
00:07:32.430 little
00:07:32.700 thin

00:07:33.530 but
00:07:34.530 you
00:07:34.800 don't
00:07:34.980 worry
00:07:35.250 about
00:07:35.370 that
00:07:35.880 it
00:07:36.180 will

00:07:36.530 get
00:07:37.530 the
00:07:37.770 texture
00:07:38.340 gradually
00:07:39.090 now
00:07:39.840 I'll
00:07:40.280 greed

00:07:41.280 a
00:07:41.310 pinch
00:07:41.760 of
00:07:41.940 nutmeg
00:07:42.210 into
00:07:42.840 it
00:07:52.280 don't
00:07:53.280 add
00:07:53.460 much

00:07:53.820 because
00:07:55.070 it
00:07:56.070 has
00:07:56.220 a
00:07:56.250 very
00:07:56.490 strong

00:08:04.590 cream
00:08:05.250 in
00:08:05.550 this
00:08:05.820 but
00:08:06.180 I
00:08:06.210 don't
00:08:06.600 prefer

00:08:07.050 adding
00:08:07.380 green
00:08:07.650 because
00:08:08.010 it
00:08:08.220 makes
00:08:08.460 the

00:08:21.840 little
00:08:22.290 cold
00:08:22.710 so
00:08:23.670 that
00:08:23.910 the
