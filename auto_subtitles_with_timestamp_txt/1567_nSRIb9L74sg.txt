00:02:23.250 cream
00:02:23.640 in

00:02:23.850 it
00:02:23.940 it

00:02:24.930 enhances
00:02:25.350 the
00:02:25.410 chowder

00:02:30.320 first
00:02:31.320 we

00:02:32.820 take
00:02:33.030 the
00:02:33.150 bacon
00:02:33.650 and
00:02:34.650 we
00:02:34.800 want
00:02:34.980 to
00:02:35.040 cook
00:02:35.130 it
00:02:35.280 on

00:02:35.370 a
00:02:35.400 medium
00:02:35.460 heat
00:02:36.030 because
00:02:36.300 we
00:02:36.420 don't
00:02:36.540 want
00:02:36.690 to

00:02:39.090 pieces
00:02:39.720 in
00:02:39.960 there
00:02:40.260 and
00:02:41.780 listen
00:02:42.780 to
00:02:42.840 that
00:02:42.900 you

00:02:43.260 can
00:02:43.560 almost
00:02:43.680 smell
00:02:43.860 it
00:02:44.100 can't

00:02:46.290 the
00:02:46.410 bacon
