00:02:27.810 enough

00:02:28.049 for
00:02:28.109 this
00:02:28.469 and
00:02:28.769 then
00:02:29.250 to
00:02:29.400 actually
00:02:29.879 form
00:02:30.239 the

00:02:30.450 crown
00:02:31.049 of
00:02:31.439 cheesy
00:02:31.799 bites
00:02:32.129 if
00:02:32.310 you
00:02:32.519 will
00:02:32.700 you

00:02:33.299 just
00:02:33.480 want
00:02:33.629 to
00:02:33.689 take
00:02:33.870 each
00:02:34.049 piece
00:02:34.109 here
00:02:34.829 and

00:02:35.010 you
00:02:35.219 want
00:02:35.370 to
00:02:35.459 pull
00:02:35.639 it
00:02:35.760 up
00:02:35.909 and
00:02:36.170 flip
00:02:37.170 it
00:02:37.200 90

00:02:37.920 degrees
00:02:38.549 when
00:02:39.480 you
00:02:39.599 turn
00:02:39.780 these
00:02:39.959 over
00:02:40.409 make

00:02:40.650 sure
00:02:40.859 that
00:02:41.040 that
00:02:41.219 sealed
00:02:42.120 side
00:02:42.480 where
00:02:42.840 the

00:02:42.930 seam
00:02:43.139 is
00:02:43.170 of
00:02:43.530 the
00:02:43.590 dough
00:02:43.769 stays
00:02:44.519 on
00:02:44.760 the
00:02:44.879 bottom

00:02:45.239 so
00:02:45.419 that
00:02:45.450 way
00:02:45.659 when
00:02:45.810 you
00:02:45.930 bake
00:02:46.139 it
00:02:46.169 they
00:02:46.620 stay

00:02:46.950 sealed
00:02:47.280 that
00:02:47.970 they
00:02:48.090 don't
00:02:48.239 come
00:02:48.450 undone
00:02:48.829 and

00:02:49.829 just
00:02:50.340 go
00:02:50.459 around
00:02:50.579 and
00:02:51.030 turn
00:02:51.450 each
00:02:51.720 of
00:02:52.019 these

00:02:52.139 pieces
00:02:52.470 90
00:02:53.280 degrees
00:02:53.669 they
00:02:53.909 don't
00:02:54.060 have
00:02:54.180 to
00:02:54.299 be

00:02:54.389 touching
00:02:54.659 it's
00:02:55.409 perfectly
00:02:55.889 fine
00:02:56.129 if
00:02:56.430 there's

00:02:56.700 space
00:02:57.120 between
00:02:57.150 them
00:02:57.719 that's
00:02:57.900 actually

00:02:58.260 preferable
00:02:58.579 because
00:02:59.579 this
00:02:59.909 dough
00:03:00.120 will
00:03:00.450 kind

00:03:00.840 of
00:03:00.900 rise
00:03:01.200 and
00:03:01.230 spread
00:03:01.829 out
00:03:02.010 as
00:03:02.219 it
00:03:02.519 bakes
00:03:02.730 and

00:03:03.180 now
00:03:03.870 we
00:03:03.930 can
00:03:04.109 go
00:03:04.200 ahead
00:03:04.319 and
00:03:04.650 build
00:03:04.889 the

00:03:05.010 toppings
00:03:05.430 on
00:03:05.639 our
00:03:05.909 pizza
00:03:06.239 I'm
00:03:07.139 just
00:03:07.290 going

00:03:07.409 take
00:03:07.500 my
00:03:07.680 pizza
00:03:07.859 sauce
00:03:08.159 here
00:03:08.519 again
00:03:08.969 I
00:03:09.209 will

00:03:09.419 put
00:03:09.510 a
00:03:09.569 link
00:03:09.780 that
00:03:09.959 shows
00:03:10.200 how
00:03:10.409 I
00:03:10.439 make
00:03:10.709 that

00:03:11.189 below
00:03:11.370 it's
00:03:12.150 super
00:03:12.510 simple

00:03:17.909 little
00:03:18.629 bit
00:03:18.989 of
00:03:19.049 salt
00:03:19.229 I
00:03:19.409 think

00:03:20.250 but
00:03:20.549 I'll

00:03:25.949 spoon
00:03:26.190 I'm
00:03:26.790 going
00:03:27.000 to
00:03:27.060 spread
00:03:27.239 an
00:03:27.389 even
00:03:27.689 layer

00:03:27.870 of
00:03:28.109 this
00:03:28.290 all
00:03:28.530 the
00:03:28.739 way
00:03:28.829 across

00:03:30.599 dough
00:03:30.780 you
00:03:31.560 want
00:03:31.650 to
00:03:31.769 make
00:03:31.859 sure

00:03:31.889 that
00:03:32.129 that
00:03:32.280 sauce
00:03:32.879 goes
00:03:33.150 all
00:03:33.419 the
00:03:33.449 way
00:03:33.540 up
00:03:33.780 to

00:03:33.900 the
00:03:34.019 edges
00:03:34.470 of
00:03:34.650 the
00:03:34.769 pizza
00:03:35.099 bites
00:03:35.329 but
00:03:36.329 don't

00:03:36.510 go
00:03:36.720 real
00:03:37.260 heavy
00:03:37.470 on
00:03:37.590 this
00:03:37.799 pizza
00:03:38.159 sauce
00:03:38.310 using

00:03:39.090 too
00:03:39.209 much
00:03:39.389 sauce
00:03:39.629 ends

00:03:40.949 a

00:03:40.979 soggy
00:03:41.220 crust
00:03:41.549 that's
00:03:42.359 not
00:03:42.569 good
00:03:42.780 so
00:03:42.930 just
00:03:43.349 use

00:03:43.470 a
00:03:43.500 thin
00:03:43.620 layer
00:03:43.949 and

00:03:50.340 will
00:03:50.549 be
00:03:50.639 melting
00:03:50.939 on
00:03:51.030 my

00:03:51.060 pizzas
00:03:51.569 the
00:03:52.199 secret
00:03:52.590 is
00:03:52.769 I
00:03:52.919 grate

00:04:01.169 has
00:04:01.379 cellulose
00:04:01.859 on
00:04:02.040 it

00:04:02.189 which
00:04:02.340 kind
00:04:02.489 of
00:04:02.579 impedes
00:04:03.090 the

00:04:04.139 enos
00:04:04.560 of

00:04:04.739 the
00:04:04.919 cheese
00:04:05.189 so
00:04:06.150 whenever
00:04:06.329 you
00:04:06.509 can
00:04:06.720 if
00:04:06.930 you
00:04:07.019 if

00:04:07.319 you're
00:04:07.500 going

00:04:10.229 shred
00:04:10.560 it
00:04:10.590 yourself
00:04:11.099 but
00:04:12.030 I

00:04:12.090 ended
00:04:12.269 up
00:04:12.359 using
00:04:12.540 about
00:04:12.720 6
00:04:13.079 ounces
00:04:13.229 of

00:04:13.769 here
00:04:14.069 you

00:04:14.340 want
00:04:14.459 to
00:04:14.489 spread
00:04:14.699 that
00:04:14.849 evenly

00:04:15.169 again
00:04:16.169 all

00:04:16.680 to
00:04:16.739 the
00:04:16.919 edges
00:04:17.340 of
00:04:17.370 the

00:04:17.549 cheesy
00:04:18.000 bites
00:04:18.299 and
00:04:18.659 then
00:04:19.049 I'm
00:04:19.289 going

00:04:20.340 with
00:04:20.609 pepperoni
00:04:20.969 you

00:04:27.080 do
00:04:27.230 use
00:04:27.410 pepperoni

00:04:27.950 because
00:04:28.430 pepperoni
00:04:28.850 shrinks
00:04:29.330 up
00:04:29.420 in

00:04:34.490 a
00:04:34.520 little
00:04:34.730 bit
00:04:34.880 and
00:04:35.180 go
00:04:35.630 as
00:04:35.780 heavy
00:04:36.050 on
