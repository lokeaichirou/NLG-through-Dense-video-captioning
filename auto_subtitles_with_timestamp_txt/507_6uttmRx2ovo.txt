00:04:51.639 and
00:04:53.080 I
00:04:54.080 will
00:04:54.889 check
00:04:55.130 also
00:04:55.340 if
00:04:55.849 it's
00:04:56.090 soft

00:04:56.690 enough
00:04:56.840 and
00:04:58.660 if
00:04:59.660 it
00:04:59.810 is
00:05:00.020 soft
00:05:00.380 enough
00:05:00.710 then
00:05:01.160 we

00:05:01.550 still
00:05:02.270 wanna
00:05:02.510 run
00:05:02.660 it
00:05:02.990 for
00:05:03.260 around
00:05:03.410 1
00:05:03.919 minute

00:05:04.220 in
00:05:05.090 the
00:05:05.270 food
00:05:05.449 processor
00:05:05.840 processor
00:05:06.440 so
00:05:06.680 it

00:05:06.860 gets
00:05:07.130 nice
00:05:07.880 and
00:05:08.240 elastic

00:05:11.389 here
00:05:12.169 we
00:05:12.289 go
00:05:12.439 unchecking
00:05:14.319 the
00:05:15.319 fifth
00:05:15.590 license

00:05:16.159 solved
00:05:17.379 but
00:05:19.060 it
00:05:20.060 needs
00:05:20.389 a
00:05:20.710 30
00:05:21.710 seconds
00:05:22.250 45

00:05:22.610 seconds
00:05:23.240 more

00:05:28.479 okay
00:05:29.479 when
00:05:29.840 this
00:05:30.080 is
00:05:30.229 done
00:05:30.500 in
00:05:30.830 my
00:05:31.129 large
00:05:31.689 pod
00:05:32.689 I

00:05:33.080 added
00:05:33.770 water
00:05:33.979 I'm
00:05:34.370 adding
00:05:34.789 a
00:05:35.120 teaspoon
00:05:35.539 of

00:05:35.990 salt
00:05:36.229 and
00:05:36.620 I
00:05:37.340 want
00:05:37.550 to
00:05:37.639 bring
00:05:37.819 it
00:05:38.000 to
00:05:38.150 boil

00:05:38.469 while
00:05:39.469 I'm
00:05:39.800 working
00:05:40.340 on
00:05:40.550 my
00:05:41.180 dough
00:05:41.500 okay
00:05:42.500 so

00:05:42.710 this
00:05:43.009 is
00:05:43.189 half
00:05:43.490 of
00:05:43.669 the
00:05:43.909 of
00:05:44.300 the
00:05:44.629 dough
00:05:45.129 the

00:05:46.129 other
00:05:46.310 half
00:05:46.610 I
00:05:46.879 packed
00:05:47.810 up
00:05:47.990 nicely
00:05:48.409 in
00:05:48.469 a

00:05:48.590 ziplock
00:05:48.949 bag
00:05:49.159 so
00:05:49.370 it
00:05:49.490 doesn't
00:05:49.879 dry
00:05:50.060 out
00:05:51.430 go

00:05:52.430 it's
00:05:53.150 nice
00:05:53.419 and
00:05:53.689 the
00:05:53.750 last
00:05:53.990 take
00:05:54.259 you
00:05:54.500 put
00:05:55.009 some

00:05:55.219 flour
00:05:55.460 if
00:05:55.699 you
00:05:55.849 need
00:05:56.030 if
00:05:56.180 it's
00:05:56.360 a
00:05:56.449 little
00:05:56.569 bit

00:05:56.750 sticky
00:05:57.020 put
00:05:57.319 more
00:05:57.560 flour
00:05:57.740 but
00:05:58.250 in
00:05:58.939 my
00:05:59.120 case
00:05:59.180 it

00:05:59.569 was
00:05:59.599 not
00:05:59.930 sticking
00:06:00.409 to
00:06:00.560 the
00:06:00.680 table
00:06:01.069 and
00:06:01.279 then

00:06:02.210 with
00:06:02.419 the
00:06:02.569 rolling
00:06:02.900 pin
00:06:02.930 we're
00:06:03.379 going
00:06:03.620 to
00:06:03.800 be

00:06:03.919 rolling
00:06:04.310 it
00:06:04.490 and
00:06:05.139 I
00:06:06.550 think
00:06:07.550 it
00:06:07.879 should
00:06:08.090 be

00:06:08.120 between
00:06:08.539 one
00:06:08.779 and
00:06:09.080 two
00:06:09.439 millimeters
00:06:09.979 but
00:06:10.219 it

00:06:10.400 does
00:06:10.610 depends
00:06:11.150 on
00:06:11.270 what
00:06:11.539 you
00:06:11.719 like
00:06:12.370 my
00:06:13.370 mom

00:06:13.580 likes
00:06:13.879 the
00:06:14.120 match
00:06:14.360 dinner
00:06:14.689 I
00:06:15.110 like
00:06:15.710 them
00:06:15.919 a

00:06:15.949 little
00:06:16.129 bit
00:06:16.370 thicker
00:06:16.639 that's
00:06:17.000 how
00:06:17.150 my
00:06:17.300 grandma

00:06:17.750 used
00:06:17.960 to
00:06:18.080 make
00:06:18.289 a
00:06:18.529 Rakhi
00:06:18.789 but
00:06:19.789 it's
00:06:19.939 a
00:06:20.060 lot
00:06:20.240 of
00:06:20.509 a

00:06:20.750 lot
00:06:21.080 of
00:06:21.110 rolling
00:06:22.509 we
00:06:23.509 go

00:06:27.500 the

00:06:27.650 dough
00:06:27.830 over
00:06:27.860 so
00:06:28.490 it
00:06:28.580 doesn't
00:06:29.379 stick
00:06:30.379 to
00:06:30.590 our

00:06:33.010 in
00:06:34.010 from

00:07:59.630 touches
00:07:59.900 the

00:08:00.200 edges
00:08:00.680 then

00:08:14.210 much

00:08:14.390 you
