00:00:00.079 hi
00:00:01.079 everyone
00:00:01.290 I'm
00:00:01.650 Simon
00:00:02.100 I'm
00:00:02.399 going
00:00:02.550 to
00:00:02.610 show

00:00:02.730 you
00:00:02.820 today
00:00:02.939 how
00:00:03.120 to
00:00:03.419 make
00:00:03.799 inside-out
00:00:04.799 roll

00:00:05.009 sushi
00:00:05.609 roll
00:00:05.879 with
00:00:06.089 some
00:00:06.390 spicy
00:00:06.779 tuna
00:00:07.080 red

00:00:08.429 it's
00:00:08.849 a
00:00:09.059 tinned
00:00:09.840 tuna
00:00:10.019 straight
00:00:10.500 out
00:00:10.590 of
00:00:10.650 a
00:00:10.710 can

00:00:10.920 so
00:00:11.130 there's
00:00:11.280 nothing
00:00:11.370 wrong
00:00:11.670 in
00:00:11.790 it
00:00:11.880 and
00:00:12.210 it's

00:00:12.719 been
00:00:12.900 mixed
00:00:13.139 with
00:00:13.170 some
00:00:13.349 chili
00:00:13.500 paste
00:00:13.710 and

00:00:14.059 little
00:00:15.059 mayonnaise
00:00:15.210 to
00:00:15.750 give
00:00:15.870 us
00:00:15.960 some
00:00:16.080 flavor

00:00:16.320 and
00:00:17.100 it
00:00:17.190 goes
00:00:17.310 fantastically
00:00:17.940 well
00:00:18.119 on
00:00:18.359 an

00:00:18.660 inside-out
00:00:19.109 roll
00:00:19.320 starting
00:00:20.039 with
00:00:20.220 fresh

00:00:20.939 sushi
00:00:21.180 rice
00:00:21.500 here
00:00:22.500 the
00:00:23.430 layers
00:00:23.609 across
00:00:23.910 the

00:00:24.119 middle
00:00:24.570 of
00:00:24.660 this
00:00:24.810 seaweed
00:00:25.170 which
00:00:25.680 is
00:00:25.830 down
00:00:26.010 on

00:00:26.039 the
00:00:26.189 mat
00:00:26.490 ready
00:00:26.939 to
00:00:27.090 go
00:00:27.500 move
00:00:28.500 the
00:00:29.340 rice
00:00:29.640 evenly

00:00:30.359 across
00:00:30.510 the
00:00:30.720 whole
00:00:31.250 expanse
00:00:32.250 of
00:00:32.399 the
00:00:32.550 seaweed

00:00:33.329 you
00:00:33.660 don't
00:00:33.840 press
00:00:34.020 too
00:00:34.079 hard
00:00:34.230 otherwise

00:00:34.829 you'll
00:00:35.219 find
00:00:35.460 that
00:00:35.550 it
00:00:35.670 turns
00:00:35.910 into
00:00:36.090 something

00:00:36.600 that
00:00:36.930 resembles
00:00:37.559 mashed
00:00:37.770 potato
00:00:38.129 so
00:00:38.940 move
00:00:39.420 it

00:00:39.510 nicely
00:00:39.899 across
00:00:40.079 cover
00:00:41.010 the
00:00:41.129 whole
00:00:41.280 sheet
00:00:41.550 nice

00:00:42.540 and
00:00:42.719 even

00:00:43.200 I
00:00:43.230 call
00:00:44.010 it
00:00:44.129 moving
00:00:44.489 rather
00:00:44.700 than
00:00:44.879 actually

00:00:45.149 pressing
00:00:45.510 so
00:00:45.719 you're
00:00:45.840 moving
00:00:46.050 the
00:00:46.350 rice

00:00:46.500 across
00:00:46.800 once
00:00:47.640 it's
00:00:47.789 nice
00:00:47.969 a
00:00:48.239 nice
00:00:48.390 layer

00:00:48.660 you're
00:00:48.989 just
00:00:49.200 going
00:00:49.350 to
00:00:49.379 take
00:00:49.500 some
00:00:49.530 mustard

00:00:49.950 seeds
00:00:50.190 and
00:00:50.430 sprinkle
00:00:50.640 on
00:00:50.820 the
00:00:50.879 outside
00:00:51.440 just

00:00:52.440 because
00:00:52.620 they've
00:00:52.710 got
00:00:52.800 a
00:00:52.829 flavor
00:00:53.070 and
00:00:53.280 a

00:00:53.370 little
00:00:53.430 bit
00:00:53.610 of
00:00:53.699 color
00:00:53.910 onto
00:00:54.000 the
00:00:54.149 outside

00:00:54.270 with
00:00:54.690 a
00:00:54.750 texture
00:00:55.250 then
00:00:56.250 I
00:00:56.280 take
00:00:56.579 my
00:00:56.789 sushi
00:00:57.360 roll

00:00:57.539 that's
00:00:58.020 ready
00:00:58.260 to
00:00:58.289 flip
00:00:58.710 onto
00:00:59.430 its
00:00:59.670 back
00:01:00.230 and
00:01:01.230 I

00:01:01.590 lay
00:01:01.890 on
00:01:01.920 the
00:01:02.539 tuna
00:01:03.739 it's
00:01:04.739 probably
00:01:05.400 better
00:01:05.580 to

00:01:05.729 use
00:01:05.850 a
00:01:05.970 spoon
00:01:06.299 initially
00:01:06.750 there
00:01:07.710 a
00:01:08.010 nice

00:01:08.400 amount
00:01:08.670 in
00:01:09.000 the
00:01:09.060 middle
00:01:09.290 flattened
00:01:10.290 out
00:01:10.700 so

00:01:11.700 that
00:01:11.880 we
00:01:11.970 can
00:01:12.110 you
00:01:13.110 will
00:01:13.260 see
00:01:13.439 why
00:01:13.650 in
00:01:13.710 a
00:01:13.890 moment

00:01:15.799 using
00:01:16.799 a
00:01:16.830 spoon
00:01:17.040 probably
00:01:17.490 keep
00:01:17.610 your
00:01:17.729 fingers

00:01:17.970 a
00:01:18.000 little
00:01:18.090 bit
00:01:18.270 cleaner
00:01:18.540 although
00:01:19.110 I
00:01:19.140 am

00:01:19.290 wearing
00:01:19.470 gloves
00:01:20.240 then
00:01:21.240 I'm
00:01:21.330 taking
00:01:21.450 some

00:01:21.720 fresh
00:01:21.869 red
00:01:22.080 peppers
00:01:22.110 which
00:01:22.530 I've
00:01:22.680 cut
00:01:22.860 and
00:01:23.549 I'm

00:01:23.640 laying
00:01:23.880 across
00:01:24.119 the
00:01:24.330 middle
00:01:24.659 of
00:01:25.229 the
00:01:25.650 tuna
00:01:27.110 now

00:01:28.110 very
00:01:28.500 carefully
00:01:28.890 I
00:01:28.920 lift
00:01:29.189 at
00:01:29.310 one
00:01:29.430 end
00:01:29.570 holding

00:01:30.570 the
00:01:30.750 ingredients
00:01:31.530 and
00:01:31.680 to
00:01:32.400 nipping
00:01:32.909 and

00:01:33.030 tucking
00:01:33.090 to
00:01:34.079 the
00:01:34.170 end
00:01:34.759 leaving
00:01:35.759 a
00:01:35.820 little
00:01:35.970 bit

00:01:36.119 of
00:01:36.180 an
00:01:36.240 overlap
00:01:36.570 so
00:01:37.320 that
00:01:37.470 I
00:01:37.530 can
00:01:37.740 a
00:01:37.979 little

00:01:38.490 space

00:02:02.340 in
00:02:02.670 the
00:02:03.659 middle
00:02:03.869 and
