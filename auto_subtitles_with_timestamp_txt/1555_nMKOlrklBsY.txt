00:01:02.429 the
00:01:02.479 skin
00:01:03.479 here
00:01:04.080 instead
00:01:04.530 of

00:01:04.739 boiling
00:01:05.460 potatoes
00:01:06.090 which
00:01:06.899 introduces
00:01:07.500 more

00:01:07.829 moisture
00:01:08.520 to
00:01:09.180 your
00:01:09.210 mashed
00:01:09.450 potatoes
00:01:09.899 we're

00:01:10.229 going
00:01:10.500 to
00:01:10.649 steam
00:01:11.070 them
00:01:11.369 now
00:01:11.670 steaming
00:01:12.509 the

00:01:12.659 technique
00:01:13.049 of
00:01:13.200 steaming
00:01:13.469 the
00:01:14.100 water
00:01:14.579 vapors

00:01:15.090 when
00:01:15.509 steaming
00:01:15.960 are
00:01:16.079 at
00:01:16.229 the
00:01:16.350 same

00:01:16.619 temperature
00:01:17.070 as
00:01:17.429 if
00:01:17.729 you
00:01:17.880 were
00:01:18.030 to
00:01:18.210 boil

00:01:18.539 potatoes
00:01:19.079 so
00:01:20.009 that
00:01:20.159 same
00:01:20.719 212
00:01:21.719 degrees
00:01:22.170 but

00:01:22.770 the
00:01:23.429 advantage
00:01:23.880 of
00:01:24.030 steaming
00:01:24.299 is
00:01:24.570 that
00:01:24.750 you're

00:01:24.869 not
00:01:25.079 introducing
00:01:25.890 an
00:01:26.299 excessive
00:01:27.299 amount
00:01:27.600 of

00:01:27.750 moisture
00:01:28.259 into
00:01:28.920 the
00:01:29.009 potatoes
00:01:29.490 which
00:01:29.729 gives

00:01:30.090 you
00:01:30.359 this
00:01:30.570 kind
00:01:30.869 of
00:01:30.960 gloppy
00:01:31.350 mashed
00:01:32.100 potato

00:01:32.759 so
00:01:33.329 steaming
00:01:33.780 is
00:01:33.929 really
00:01:34.469 the
00:01:34.679 best
00:01:34.859 way
00:01:35.189 to

00:01:35.490 cook
00:01:36.090 your
00:01:36.149 potatoes
00:01:36.390 I'm
00:01:37.049 just
00:01:37.229 going
00:01:37.350 to
00:01:37.409 cut

00:01:37.590 these
00:01:37.710 in
00:01:37.890 half
00:01:37.920 and
00:01:38.310 leave
00:01:38.429 them
00:01:38.609 in
00:01:38.700 pretty

00:01:38.999 big
00:01:39.240 chunks
00:01:39.780 and
00:01:39.899 so
00:01:40.229 now
00:01:40.409 I'm
00:01:40.920 going
00:01:41.219 to
00:01:41.399 steam

00:01:41.880 the
00:01:42.060 potatoes
00:01:42.420 now
00:01:42.630 this
00:01:42.719 is
00:01:42.840 2
00:01:43.259 pounds
00:01:43.829 of
00:01:43.950 the

00:01:44.009 Yukon
00:01:44.429 Gold
00:01:44.640 potatoes
00:01:45.090 I
00:01:45.329 have
00:01:45.960 a
00:01:46.079 steamer

00:01:46.350 basket
00:01:46.469 set
00:01:47.249 over
00:01:47.549 about
00:01:47.880 two
00:01:48.240 inches
00:01:48.600 of

00:01:48.799 boiling
00:01:49.799 water
00:01:50.280 and
00:01:50.609 just
00:01:51.600 arrange
00:01:51.899 them
00:01:52.170 in
00:01:52.289 a

00:01:52.350 single
00:01:52.590 layer
00:01:52.770 so
00:01:53.249 that
00:01:53.399 they
00:01:53.490 cook
00:01:53.789 at
00:01:53.969 a

00:01:53.999 uniform
00:01:54.359 rate
00:01:54.659 and
00:01:55.079 these
00:01:55.890 big
00:01:56.340 pieces
00:01:56.579 will

00:01:56.969 probably
00:01:57.509 take
00:01:57.780 anywhere
00:01:58.319 from
00:01:58.850 20
00:01:59.850 to
00:02:00.060 25

00:02:00.659 minutes
00:02:01.109 to
00:02:01.530 steam
00:02:01.829 so
00:02:02.249 it's
00:02:02.609 been
00:02:02.789 about
00:02:03.030 25

00:02:03.600 minutes
00:02:03.929 and
00:02:04.259 our
00:02:04.649 potatoes
00:02:05.310 are
00:02:06.259 wonderfully

00:02:08.110 using
00:02:08.740 a
00:02:08.890 ricer
00:02:09.460 creates
00:02:10.060 the
00:02:10.270 fluffiest

00:02:10.810 mashed
00:02:11.230 potatoes
00:02:11.830 I'm

00:02:12.850 take

00:02:14.310 potatoes

00:02:15.940 the
00:02:16.600 center
00:02:16.900 of

00:02:17.140 the
00:02:17.230 ricer
00:02:17.620 and
00:02:17.860 this
00:02:18.540 this
00:02:19.540 well
00:02:19.930 here
00:02:20.230 is

00:02:20.380 called
00:02:20.650 the
00:02:20.710 hopper
00:02:21.310 of
00:02:21.550 the
00:02:21.730 rice
00:02:21.910 or
00:02:22.090 a

00:02:22.120 little
00:02:22.360 fact
00:02:22.660 for
00:02:23.050 you
00:02:23.200 and
00:02:23.970 let's
00:02:24.970 see
00:02:25.060 I'll

00:02:25.180 fill
00:02:25.420 it
00:02:25.540 up
00:02:25.600 about
00:02:25.810 two-thirds
00:02:26.350 of
00:02:26.530 the
00:02:26.650 way

00:02:26.800 and
00:02:27.070 then
00:02:27.820 all
00:02:28.060 you
00:02:28.210 do
00:02:28.480 is
00:02:28.750 you
00:02:29.140 press
00:02:29.470 down

00:02:29.860 kind
00:02:30.190 of
00:02:30.220 like
00:02:30.370 a
00:02:30.400 citrus
00:02:30.880 press
00:02:31.150 you
00:02:31.660 press

00:02:31.990 down
00:02:32.260 and
00:02:32.560 the
00:02:32.710 wonderful
00:02:33.040 steamed
00:02:33.550 potatoes

00:02:34.180 are
00:02:34.660 going
00:02:35.050 to
00:02:35.320 rice
00:02:36.040 out
00:02:36.490 of
00:02:36.790 the
00:02:37.180 bottom
00:02:37.720 and

00:02:37.870 the
00:02:38.050 sides
00:02:38.320 of
00:02:38.680 the
00:02:38.860 ricer
00:02:39.280 try
00:02:39.730 avoid
00:02:40.090 using
00:02:40.600 a

00:02:40.780 food
00:02:41.170 processor
00:02:41.200 a
00:02:42.070 blender
00:02:42.910 or
00:02:43.150 even
00:02:43.630 those

00:02:43.810 handheld
00:02:44.880 mixers
00:02:45.880 because
00:02:46.360 what
00:02:46.570 they
00:02:46.720 do
00:02:46.780 is

00:02:47.050 they
00:02:47.230 shear
00:02:47.560 through
00:02:47.830 the
00:02:48.010 potatoes
00:02:48.520 the

00:02:48.820 starch
00:02:49.120 granules
00:02:49.630 and
00:02:49.840 they
00:02:50.260 create
00:02:50.709 a
00:02:50.740 very

00:02:51.280 gluey
00:02:51.760 mashed
00:02:52.090 potato
00:02:52.570 so
00:02:52.900 avoid
00:02:53.290 machines

00:02:53.800 and
00:02:54.340 now
00:02:55.000 for
00:02:55.330 the
00:02:55.420 richness
00:02:55.990 I
00:02:56.290 have
00:02:56.740 equal

00:02:57.130 parts
00:02:57.610 milk

00:02:58.240 butter
00:02:58.450 so
00:02:58.750 1/2
00:02:59.020 cup

00:02:59.380 milk

00:02:59.800 1/2
00:03:00.040 cup
00:03:00.220 of
00:03:00.610 butter

00:03:01.090 and
00:03:01.180 to
00:03:01.810 that
00:03:01.990 I'm
00:03:02.230 going
00:03:02.500 to
00:03:02.620 add
00:03:02.770 the

00:03:02.950 seasonings
00:03:03.520 because
00:03:03.850 I
00:03:04.090 really
00:03:04.540 don't
00:03:04.720 want

00:03:05.110 to
00:03:05.230 mix
00:03:05.950 a
00:03:06.160 lot
00:03:06.280 here
00:03:06.580 it's
00:03:06.730 kind
00:03:06.970 of
