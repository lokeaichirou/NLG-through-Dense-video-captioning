00:00:07.070 I
00:00:07.160 think
00:00:07.820 the
00:00:07.940 V
00:00:08.060 initial
00:00:08.210 silk
00:00:08.800 be
00:00:09.800 viewable

00:00:10.330 it's
00:00:11.330 actually
00:00:11.540 not
00:00:12.020 that
00:00:12.080 much
00:00:12.320 work
00:00:17.140 so
00:00:18.140 I

00:00:18.170 would
00:00:18.530 save
00:00:18.710 time
00:00:19.370 if
00:00:20.270 they
00:00:20.450 got
00:00:20.630 the
00:00:20.660 breast

00:00:20.990 and
00:00:21.230 everything
00:00:21.680 start
00:00:22.720 by

00:00:26.750 actually
00:00:27.019 from

00:00:27.199 Pennsylvania

00:00:37.370 wrap
00:00:37.700 over
00:00:38.030 it
00:00:38.149 so
