00:01:01.640 you
00:01:02.640 can
00:01:03.090 use
00:01:03.420 like
00:01:04.080 a
00:01:04.140 substitute

00:01:04.860 you
00:01:05.010 could
00:01:05.189 use
00:01:05.369 radishes
00:01:06.320 but
00:01:07.640 or
00:01:08.640 just
00:01:09.119 care

00:01:10.490 and

00:01:43.960 ribbon
00:01:44.960 like

00:01:47.710 slices
00:01:48.820 of
00:01:49.820 the
00:01:50.630 radish
00:01:51.350 I
00:01:52.300 think
00:01:53.300 that's

00:01:53.420 enough
00:01:53.720 but
00:01:54.500 God
00:01:54.650 just
00:01:54.680 with
00:01:55.040 the
00:01:55.160 same
00:01:55.369 thing

00:01:55.550 with
00:01:55.670 carrots
00:01:56.060 got
00:01:56.690 carrots
00:01:57.020 and
00:01:57.350 here's
00:01:57.560 I

00:01:57.680 care
00:01:57.890 that
00:01:58.070 by
00:01:58.250 the
00:01:58.310 Margay
00:01:58.760 was
00:01:58.910 so
00:01:59.030 cute

00:01:59.619 staying
00:02:00.619 there
00:02:01.330 do
00:02:02.330 you
00:02:02.649 sign
00:02:03.649 but
00:02:04.399 anyways
00:02:04.820 so

00:02:06.070 you
00:02:07.070 don't
00:02:07.250 want
00:02:07.460 the
00:02:07.840 carrot
00:02:10.510 peels
00:02:11.510 to
00:02:11.690 be

00:02:11.930 too
00:02:12.320 thin
00:02:12.950 because
00:02:13.160 you'll
00:02:14.000 lose
00:02:14.270 some
00:02:14.630 of
00:02:14.900 the

00:02:15.140 crunchiness
00:02:15.590 of
00:02:15.950 the
00:02:17.020 carrot

00:02:20.020 so
00:02:21.020 I
00:02:21.350 use
00:02:21.650 a
00:02:21.680 you
00:02:22.430 know
00:02:22.550 like
00:02:22.760 fairly
00:02:23.300 hot

00:02:23.900 thick
00:02:28.900 peeler
00:02:29.900 so
00:02:30.910 let's
00:02:31.910 do
00:02:32.090 the
00:02:32.209 same
00:02:32.420 with

00:02:32.480 the
00:02:32.780 carrots
00:02:33.230 so
00:02:36.730 the
00:02:37.730 daikon
00:02:38.180 in
00:02:38.360 the
00:02:38.680 carrots

00:02:39.680 are
00:02:40.340 just
00:02:40.670 a
00:02:40.760 substitute
00:02:41.360 of
00:02:41.480 the
00:02:41.630 French

00:02:42.500 in
00:02:42.620 the
00:02:43.010 traditional
00:02:43.610 jumbled
00:02:44.540 jumbled
00:02:45.080 bell

00:02:45.230 sandwich
00:02:45.680 and
00:02:45.950 basically
00:02:46.880 the
00:02:47.630 it's
00:02:47.959 because

00:02:48.410 the
00:02:49.000 the
00:02:50.000 French
00:02:50.330 pickles
00:02:51.019 were
00:02:51.410 so
00:02:51.709 expensive

00:02:52.330 that
00:02:54.310 Vietnamese
00:02:55.310 people
00:02:55.670 try
00:02:56.120 to
00:02:56.150 find

00:02:58.480 ingredients
00:02:59.480 that
00:03:00.019 they
00:03:00.140 could
00:03:00.350 that
00:03:00.680 were

00:03:00.829 available
00:03:01.160 inland
00:03:01.850 and
00:03:02.630 just
00:03:04.030 to
00:03:05.030 make
00:03:05.209 them

00:03:05.420 taste
00:03:06.019 as
00:03:08.350 closely
00:03:09.350 as
00:03:09.530 possible
00:03:09.680 as
00:03:10.340 the

00:03:10.989 costly
00:03:11.989 French
00:03:12.380 products
00:03:13.390 so
00:03:14.390 it's
00:03:14.570 not
00:03:14.780 that

00:03:15.079 complicated
00:03:15.410 to
00:03:15.799 just

00:03:21.350 tip
00:03:22.340 of
00:03:22.370 the

00:03:22.519 knife
00:03:23.030 and
