00:03:25.099 fine
00:03:25.340 to
00:03:25.400 eat
00:03:25.579 and
00:03:26.500 here's
00:03:27.500 the
00:03:27.709 the

00:03:28.519 Korean
00:03:29.090 radish
00:03:29.480 I
00:03:29.599 peeled
00:03:29.900 it

00:03:30.349 diced
00:03:30.590 it

00:03:30.799 up
00:03:30.919 and
00:03:31.160 my
00:03:31.819 mother-in-law
00:03:32.120 actually
00:03:32.930 taught

00:03:33.139 me
00:03:33.290 about
00:03:33.379 adding
00:03:33.980 that
00:03:34.099 to
00:03:34.310 soup
00:03:35.209 any
00:03:35.450 kind
00:03:35.690 of

00:03:35.750 soup
00:03:35.959 or
00:03:36.109 a
00:03:36.169 miso
00:03:36.500 soup
00:03:36.709 in
00:03:36.889 particular
00:03:37.340 she

00:03:37.519 says
00:03:37.730 you
00:03:37.879 know
00:03:38.000 whom
00:03:38.720 will
00:03:38.930 she
00:03:39.049 wanna
00:03:39.470 means

00:03:39.949 like
00:03:40.220 the
00:03:40.250 the
00:03:41.030 broth
00:03:41.329 will
00:03:41.660 be
00:03:41.840 refreshing
00:03:42.470 so

00:03:43.400 this
00:03:43.940 is
00:03:43.970 really
00:03:44.329 nice
00:03:44.709 kind

00:03:45.949 mild
00:03:46.959 sweet

00:03:47.959 radder
00:03:48.590 so
00:03:48.919 it's
00:03:49.069 not

00:03:50.269 lot
00:03:50.359 of

00:06:21.430 god-like
00:06:22.430 so
00:06:23.470 I'm
00:06:24.470 going
00:06:24.650 to

00:06:24.710 add
00:06:24.860 this
00:06:25.630 there
00:06:26.630 we
00:06:26.750 go
00:06:27.940 and
00:06:28.940 then
00:06:29.690 I
00:06:29.930 don't

00:06:30.110 even
00:06:30.170 know
00:06:30.410 if
00:06:30.440 I
00:06:30.650 can
00:06:30.830 fit
00:06:31.130 all
00:06:31.220 these
00:06:31.400 greens

00:06:31.760 in
00:06:32.030 but
00:06:32.360 we'll
00:06:32.570 we'll
00:06:33.020 try
00:06:33.260 to
00:06:33.320 make
00:06:33.590 it
00:06:33.620 work

00:06:33.920 usually
00:06:34.160 it's
00:06:34.580 the
00:06:34.820 pan
00:06:35.090 and
00:06:35.360 pot
00:06:35.540 is

00:06:35.780 overflowing
00:06:36.440 up
00:06:37.190 to
00:06:37.550 the
00:06:37.670 top
00:06:37.880 by
00:06:38.150 the
00:06:38.210 time
00:06:38.480 I

00:06:38.510 add
00:06:38.750 the
00:06:38.900 green
00:06:39.140 so
00:06:39.440 let
00:06:39.650 me
00:06:39.880 try
00:06:40.880 to
00:06:40.940 see
00:06:41.360 if
00:06:41.510 I

00:06:41.660 can
00:06:41.900 do
00:06:42.050 that
00:06:42.230 I
00:06:42.910 actually
00:06:43.910 had
00:06:44.360 to
00:06:44.390 move
00:06:45.230 to
00:06:45.590 a

00:06:45.770 bigger
00:06:46.310 pot
00:06:46.580 because
00:06:46.850 it
00:06:47.150 was
00:06:47.270 too
00:06:47.450 much
00:06:48.220 as

00:06:49.220 for
00:06:49.490 the
00:06:49.610 timing
00:06:49.910 of
00:06:50.150 all
00:06:50.300 of
00:06:50.480 this
00:06:50.630 I
00:06:51.190 added

00:06:52.190 the
00:06:53.020 onion
00:06:54.020 garlic
00:06:54.260 first
00:06:54.680 and
00:06:54.920 cook
00:06:55.040 that
00:06:55.220 for

00:06:55.340 about
00:06:55.430 10
00:06:55.760 minutes
00:06:55.940 while
00:06:56.180 I
00:06:56.210 was
00:06:56.330 chopping
00:06:56.540 up

00:06:56.780 the
00:06:56.810 other
00:06:56.990 stuff
00:06:57.290 then
00:06:58.160 I
00:06:58.190 added
00:06:58.520 the

00:06:58.820 eggplant
00:06:59.390 the
00:06:59.540 carrot
00:06:59.990 the
00:07:00.410 radish
00:07:01.930 I
00:07:02.930 think

00:07:03.680 that
00:07:03.770 was
00:07:03.860 it
00:07:04.040 the
00:07:05.030 red
00:07:05.210 pepper
00:07:05.530 and
00:07:06.530 adapt
00:07:06.830 and

00:07:07.040 cook
00:07:07.640 that
00:07:07.850 for
00:07:08.300 however
00:07:08.960 long
00:07:09.310 it
00:07:10.310 took
00:07:10.520 me

00:07:10.580 until
00:07:10.850 i
00:07:11.030 got
00:07:11.240 the
00:07:11.300 kubota
00:07:11.900 slides
00:07:12.200 up
00:07:12.410 and

00:07:12.560 then
00:07:12.710 I
00:07:12.740 add
00:07:12.920 that
00:07:13.520 and
00:07:13.940 then
00:07:14.870 the
00:07:15.650 zucchini

00:07:16.070 added
00:07:16.340 straight
00:07:16.580 away
00:07:16.760 after
00:07:16.880 that
00:07:17.030 and
00:07:17.300 then

00:07:17.360 I
00:07:17.480 cooked
00:07:17.720 it
00:07:17.810 again
00:07:18.050 for
00:07:18.260 about
00:07:18.410 10
00:07:18.890 minutes

00:07:19.160 until
00:07:19.460 I
00:07:19.640 added
00:07:20.000 the
00:07:20.180 little
00:07:20.900 tender

00:07:21.290 mushrooms
00:07:21.620 and
00:07:21.830 the
00:07:21.890 greens
00:07:22.130 so

00:07:24.860 to
00:07:24.890 kind
00:07:25.070 of
00:07:25.160 time
00:07:25.430 it

00:07:25.640 so
00:07:25.850 that
00:07:26.030 everything
00:07:26.780 will
00:07:27.050 be
00:07:28.240 properly

00:07:29.240 cooked
00:07:29.690 and

00:07:42.020 the
00:07:42.320 Greens
00:07:42.620 will
00:07:43.990 shrink
00:07:44.990 down
00:07:45.230 dramatically

00:07:45.890 as
00:07:46.250 it
