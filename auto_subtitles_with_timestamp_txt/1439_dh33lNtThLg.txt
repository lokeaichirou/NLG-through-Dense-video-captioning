00:00:46.399 so
00:00:47.399 it's
00:00:47.550 very
00:00:47.730 important
00:00:48.300 to

00:00:48.360 watch
00:00:48.629 the
00:00:48.870 quinoa
00:00:49.140 in
00:00:49.620 cold

00:00:50.460 before

00:00:51.360 cooking
00:00:51.629 quinoa
00:00:52.559 is
00:00:52.770 coated
00:00:53.250 with
00:00:53.280 a

00:00:53.399 substance

00:00:56.010 like
00:00:56.070 soap
00:00:56.430 suds
00:00:56.730 it

00:00:57.690 really
00:00:57.719 bitter
00:00:58.170 taste
00:00:58.559 so
