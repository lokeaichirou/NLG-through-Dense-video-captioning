00:05:54.149 make
00:05:54.179 two

00:05:54.599 samosas
00:05:55.080 so

00:05:56.669 filling
00:05:56.909 out
00:05:57.059 and

00:05:57.809 proceed
00:05:58.129 we

00:06:01.589 it's
00:06:02.279 an
00:06:02.490 medium
00:06:02.909 heat
00:06:03.269 and
00:06:03.629 it's

00:06:04.319 going
00:06:04.619 to
00:06:04.830 be
00:06:04.979 needs
00:06:05.309 to
00:06:05.399 be
00:06:05.490 very
00:06:05.939 well
00:06:06.209 heated

00:06:06.599 all
00:06:06.779 the
00:06:06.899 way
00:06:06.990 through
00:06:07.289 before
00:06:07.499 we
00:06:07.889 add
00:06:08.099 the

00:06:08.159 simple

00:06:08.879 into
00:06:09.149 this
00:06:09.269 oil
00:06:09.589 so
00:06:10.589 I
00:06:10.619 put
00:06:10.769 a

00:06:10.800 little
00:06:10.949 bit

00:06:13.319 it
00:06:13.469 on
00:06:13.619 there
00:06:13.829 so
00:06:14.819 it

00:06:29.810 out
00:06:29.960 pretty

00:06:30.290 thin
00:06:30.970 because
00:06:32.080 this
00:06:33.080 is
00:06:33.200 all-purpose
00:06:33.770 flour

00:06:33.860 and
00:06:35.170 it
00:06:36.170 tends
00:06:36.410 to
00:06:36.530 be

00:06:44.720 it
00:06:44.750 very

00:06:44.990 thin
