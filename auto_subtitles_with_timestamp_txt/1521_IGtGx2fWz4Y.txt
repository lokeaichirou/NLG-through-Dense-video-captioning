00:00:17.910 pre
00:00:18.330 soaked
00:00:18.779 chickpeas
00:00:19.380 now

00:00:19.949 generally
00:00:20.369 the
00:00:20.640 soaking
00:00:21.270 time
00:00:21.480 is
00:00:21.990 about
00:00:22.199 six

00:00:22.710 to
00:00:22.980 eight
00:00:23.010 hours

00:00:23.939 trust
00:00:24.210 me
00:00:24.269 if
00:00:24.510 you
00:00:24.630 want

00:00:24.779 to
00:00:24.840 make
00:00:25.109 something

00:00:27.510 least
00:00:27.810 10
00:00:28.320 hours
00:00:28.619 and
00:00:28.980 remember
00:00:29.699 after

00:00:30.240 soaking
00:00:30.630 the
00:00:30.929 chickpeas

00:00:31.590 they
00:00:31.740 should
00:00:32.009 have
00:00:32.160 become
00:00:32.309 a
00:00:32.460 little
00:00:32.759 soft

00:00:33.180 and
00:00:33.480 if
00:00:34.350 you
00:00:34.440 try
00:00:34.800 to
00:00:34.860 squeeze
00:00:35.309 them
00:00:35.730 they

00:00:36.239 should
00:00:36.390 easily
00:00:36.719 be
00:00:36.899 able
00:00:37.020 to
00:00:37.230 mash
00:00:39.980 so
00:00:40.980 before

00:00:41.550 you
00:00:41.640 cook
00:00:41.850 these
00:00:42.030 make
00:00:42.750 sure
00:00:42.899 you
00:00:43.020 drain
00:00:43.260 all

00:00:43.469 the
00:00:43.590 dirty
00:00:44.219 water
00:00:44.399 and
00:00:44.670 clean
00:00:44.789 your
00:00:45.780 chickpeas

00:00:46.050 properly
00:00:47.059 but
00:00:48.059 the
00:00:48.300 main
00:00:49.020 problem
00:00:49.500 with

00:00:49.530 garbanzo
00:00:50.399 beans
00:00:50.610 is
00:00:51.090 that
00:00:51.449 they
00:00:51.930 don't
00:00:52.230 retain

00:00:53.039 moisture
00:00:53.550 I
00:00:54.149 mean
00:00:54.780 no
00:00:55.140 matter
00:00:55.320 how
00:00:55.440 many

00:00:55.860 excess
00:00:56.460 pressure
00:00:56.969 cooker
00:00:57.390 whistles
00:00:57.719 you
00:00:57.840 give

00:00:58.170 your
00:00:58.739 chili
00:00:59.160 or
00:00:59.370 channa
00:00:59.640 will
00:00:59.879 always
00:01:00.510 be
00:01:00.719 dry

00:01:00.989 from
00:01:01.440 the
00:01:01.469 inside
00:01:02.070 you
00:01:02.850 don't
00:01:03.090 believe
00:01:03.390 me
00:01:03.629 and

00:01:03.809 just
00:01:04.439 see
00:01:05.010 this
00:01:05.640 I've
00:01:06.020 just
00:01:07.020 pressure
00:01:07.439 cooked

00:01:07.770 some
00:01:08.040 chickpeas
00:01:08.760 for
00:01:09.330 12
00:01:09.659 whistles
00:01:10.080 and
00:01:10.290 let

00:01:10.799 it
00:01:10.950 be
00:01:11.280 pressurized
00:01:11.820 naturally
00:01:12.600 they've
00:01:13.470 come

00:01:13.830 out
00:01:13.920 really
00:01:14.640 very
00:01:15.060 soft
00:01:15.420 but
00:01:16.200 if
00:01:16.619 I
00:01:16.799 cut
00:01:17.250 one

00:01:17.460 open
00:01:17.520 and
00:01:18.060 show
00:01:18.689 you
00:01:18.750 from
00:01:19.049 the
00:01:19.170 inside
00:01:19.290 you

00:01:20.280 can
00:01:20.729 see
00:01:21.000 that
00:01:21.390 they're
00:01:21.570 really
00:01:21.960 very
00:01:22.680 dry

00:01:24.350 well
00:01:25.070 you
00:01:25.490 can't
00:01:25.909 take
00:01:26.150 care
00:01:26.360 of
00:01:26.420 this
00:01:26.720 issue

00:01:26.960 of
00:01:27.229 dryness
00:01:27.560 so
00:01:27.979 in
00:01:28.729 a
00:01:28.909 very
00:01:29.270 famous
00:01:29.540 book

00:01:29.690 written
00:01:30.140 by
00:01:30.260 mr.
00:01:30.710 Harold
00:01:31.220 McGee
00:01:31.430 he
00:01:32.300 mentioned

00:01:32.720 that
00:01:32.990 baking
00:01:33.530 soda
00:01:33.560 can
00:01:34.010 reduce
00:01:34.370 the
00:01:34.610 cooking

00:01:34.760 time
00:01:35.180 of
00:01:35.210 the
00:01:35.479 beans
00:01:35.750 and
00:01:36.110 actually
00:01:36.860 make
00:01:37.010 them

00:01:37.160 absorb
00:01:37.520 more
00:01:37.850 moisture
00:01:38.140 but
00:01:39.140 the
00:01:39.470 problem

00:01:39.920 with
00:01:40.040 baking
00:01:40.430 soda
00:01:40.640 is
00:01:41.030 that
00:01:41.240 it
00:01:41.390 leaves
00:01:41.660 a

00:01:41.900 very
00:01:42.140 bitter
00:01:42.650 taste
00:01:42.740 and
00:01:43.690 that
00:01:44.690 bitterness

00:01:45.200 can
00:01:45.410 actually
00:01:45.979 be
00:01:46.100 controlled
00:01:46.460 if
00:01:46.970 the

00:01:47.150 alkaline
00:01:47.780 nature
00:01:48.140 of
00:01:48.259 the
00:01:48.380 baking
00:01:48.800 soda
00:01:48.979 can

00:01:49.400 be
00:01:49.550 neutralized
00:01:50.210 so
00:01:50.900 let's
00:01:51.110 see
00:01:51.259 a
00:01:51.290 simple

00:01:51.710 experiment
00:01:52.130 to
00:01:52.880 know
00:01:53.060 more
00:01:53.420 about
00:01:53.450 this
00:01:54.100 well

00:01:55.100 the
00:01:55.520 pH
00:01:56.000 of
00:01:56.210 your
00:01:56.450 normal
00:01:56.690 distilled
00:01:57.289 water
00:01:57.500 is

00:01:57.830 very
00:01:58.340 neutral
00:01:58.700 which
00:01:59.090 is
00:01:59.240 actually
00:01:59.630 about

00:01:59.720 seven
00:02:00.200 and
00:02:00.500 as
00:02:01.220 soon
00:02:01.460 as
00:02:01.610 you
00:02:01.759 add
00:02:01.880 baking
00:02:02.420 soda

00:02:02.450 to
00:02:02.869 the
00:02:02.930 water
00:02:03.200 you
00:02:03.830 make
00:02:04.070 it

00:02:04.340 alkaline
00:02:04.820 which
00:02:05.149 increases
00:02:05.810 the
00:02:05.990 pH
00:02:06.229 level
00:02:06.649 of

00:02:06.710 the
00:02:06.770 water

00:02:07.369 now
00:02:08.209 this
00:02:08.450 alkaline
00:02:09.020 nature
00:02:09.320 can
00:02:09.619 be

00:02:09.770 neutralized
00:02:10.220 as
00:02:10.459 soon
00:02:10.880 as
00:02:11.090 you
00:02:11.180 add
00:02:11.330 any
00:02:11.600 kind

00:02:11.900 of
00:02:12.080 acid
00:02:12.500 which
00:02:12.980 might
00:02:13.220 be
00:02:13.489 vinegar
00:02:13.940 or
00:02:14.150 any

00:02:14.540 acidic
00:02:15.020 stuff
00:02:15.230 but
00:02:16.040 the
00:02:16.489 problem
00:02:16.970 with

00:02:17.090 vinegar
00:02:17.510 is
00:02:18.080 that
00:02:18.380 it
00:02:18.650 reacts
00:02:19.310 with
00:02:19.550 baking

00:02:20.060 soda
00:02:20.209 really
00:02:20.690 quickly
00:02:21.260 and
00:02:21.650 you
00:02:22.640 cannot
00:02:22.910 take

00:02:23.180 the
00:02:23.330 advantage
00:02:23.660 of
00:02:23.959 that
00:02:24.110 alkaline
00:02:24.800 nature
00:02:25.160 of

00:02:25.310 baking
00:02:25.760 soda
00:02:25.940 hence
00:02:26.930 comes
00:02:27.590 in
00:02:27.860 your
00:02:28.160 very
00:02:28.640 own

00:02:28.760 pee
00:02:29.269 well
00:02:30.110 I
00:02:30.380 guess
00:02:30.890 you
00:02:31.430 might
00:02:31.730 know
00:02:31.970 that
00:02:32.209 E

00:02:32.630 is
00:02:32.810 acidic
00:02:33.549 but
00:02:34.549 a
00:02:34.580 very
00:02:34.880 good
00:02:35.030 property
00:02:35.269 of
00:02:35.540 E

00:02:35.810 is
00:02:36.049 that
00:02:36.530 it
00:02:36.799 does
00:02:37.100 not
00:02:37.340 react
00:02:37.760 until
00:02:38.030 it's

00:02:39.500 you
00:02:39.709 see
00:02:39.920 if
00:02:40.130 I
00:02:40.310 add
00:02:40.489 tea
00:02:40.820 to
00:02:41.000 my
00:02:41.120 normal
00:02:41.420 water

00:02:41.780 it
00:02:42.200 will
00:02:42.350 never
00:02:42.680 affect
00:02:42.890 the
00:02:43.310 pH
00:02:43.610 of
00:02:43.640 the
00:02:43.910 water

00:02:44.079 but
00:02:45.079 if
00:02:45.500 I
00:02:45.709 cook
00:02:46.070 the
00:02:46.250 tea
00:02:46.430 and
00:02:46.670 add
00:02:47.269 my
00:02:47.540 baking

00:02:47.930 soda
00:02:48.350 it
00:02:49.190 will
00:02:49.579 start
00:02:50.000 to
00:02:50.180 react
00:02:50.510 it
00:02:50.750 you
00:02:51.230 see

00:02:51.410 it
00:02:51.709 releases
00:02:52.160 carbon
00:02:52.579 dioxide
00:02:52.840 but
00:02:53.840 only
00:02:54.140 when

00:02:54.709 the
00:02:54.920 tea
00:02:55.130 is
00:02:55.340 cooked
00:02:56.000 you
00:02:56.269 can
00:02:57.049 see
00:02:57.320 a
00:02:57.470 cookie

00:02:58.220 has
00:02:58.640 a
00:02:58.670 lower
00:02:59.000 pH
00:02:59.390 which
00:02:59.959 makes
00:03:00.200 it
00:03:00.380 acetate

00:03:00.860 and
00:03:01.040 as
00:03:01.549 soon
00:03:01.760 as
00:03:01.910 I
00:03:02.030 add
00:03:02.329 baking
00:03:03.110 soda
00:03:03.320 to
00:03:03.530 it

00:03:03.560 it
00:03:04.299 neutralizes
00:03:05.299 in
00:03:06.519 fact
00:03:07.519 one
00:03:08.030 other

00:03:08.299 property
00:03:08.630 of
00:03:08.989 this
00:03:09.200 reaction
00:03:09.560 is
00:03:09.860 that
00:03:10.220 it

00:03:10.400 releases
00:03:10.820 carbon
00:03:11.000 dioxide
00:03:11.390 and
00:03:12.350 when
00:03:12.709 this

00:03:12.890 reaction
00:03:13.160 occurs
00:03:13.820 inside
00:03:14.360 a
00:03:14.420 pressure
00:03:14.810 cooker

00:03:15.110 it
00:03:15.700 increases
00:03:16.700 the
00:03:16.850 pressure
00:03:17.060 on
00:03:17.570 the

00:03:17.840 chickpeas
00:03:18.200 which
00:03:18.829 results
00:03:19.579 in
00:03:19.730 very
00:03:20.209 soft
00:03:20.480 and
