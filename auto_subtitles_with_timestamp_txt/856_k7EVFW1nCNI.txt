00:04:31.390 aware
00:04:31.720 of
00:04:31.750 what
00:04:31.900 it
00:04:32.140 is
00:04:32.170 that's
00:04:32.560 making

00:04:32.680 it

00:04:33.040 so
00:04:33.250 great

00:04:33.670 anchovies

00:04:52.840 on
00:04:53.020 the
00:04:53.080 salt
00:04:53.500 because
00:04:54.190 if
00:04:54.640 you're

00:04:54.910 using
00:04:54.940 the
00:04:55.600 anchovy
00:04:56.200 paste
00:04:56.440 that's
00:04:57.070 already
00:04:57.550 a

00:04:57.700 little
00:04:57.880 bit
00:04:58.000 salty
00:04:58.390 now
00:04:59.080 we're

00:05:04.990 right
00:05:05.170 that
00:05:05.440 was
00:05:05.590 quick
00:05:06.070 and
00:05:06.250 easy
00:05:08.190 now

00:05:09.190 you
00:05:09.250 can
00:05:09.520 see
00:05:09.880 the
00:05:10.720 little
00:05:10.930 flicks
00:05:11.530 of
00:05:11.770 pepper

00:05:12.160 in
00:05:12.460 there
00:05:12.820 and
00:05:13.590 you
00:05:14.590 can
00:05:14.740 see
00:05:14.980 it
00:05:15.220 looks
00:05:15.430 like

00:05:15.610 there's
00:05:16.090 little
00:05:16.480 lumps

00:05:17.560 actually
00:05:17.800 the
00:05:18.160 cheese
00:05:18.550 so
00:05:19.270 this
00:05:19.660 is
00:05:19.840 you
00:05:20.050 know

00:05:20.169 what
00:05:20.500 you
00:05:20.650 usually
00:05:21.010 see
00:05:21.610 when
00:05:21.910 you
00:05:22.030 have

00:05:22.440 Caesar

00:05:27.480 what
00:05:28.480 I
00:05:28.510 usually
00:05:28.900 do

00:05:29.320 is
00:05:29.560 make
00:05:30.220 it
00:05:30.460 a
00:05:30.640 day
00:05:31.300 or
00:05:31.480 two
00:05:31.660 ahead
00:05:31.960 of
00:05:32.260 time
00:05:32.560 it

00:05:32.890 actually
00:05:33.280 tastes
00:05:33.550 better
00:05:33.610 if
00:05:33.940 it
00:05:34.060 at
00:05:34.180 least

00:05:34.390 sits
00:05:34.720 overnight
00:05:35.380 and
00:05:35.680 it's
00:05:36.460 one
00:05:36.640 of
00:05:36.730 those

00:05:36.850 things
00:05:37.090 after
00:05:37.450 a
00:05:37.480 couple
00:05:37.690 days
00:05:37.960 it
00:05:38.169 just
00:05:38.200 keeps

00:05:38.860 getting
00:05:39.250 better
00:05:39.400 and
00:05:39.669 better
00:05:39.730 I'll
00:05:40.210 usually

00:05:40.600 keep
00:05:40.930 it
00:05:41.080 for
00:05:41.290 about
00:05:41.380 a
00:05:41.530 week
