00:02:12.000 the
00:02:12.060 same
00:02:12.180 thing
00:02:12.629 he
00:02:12.900 forgot
00:02:13.200 to
00:02:13.230 put

00:02:13.440 in
00:02:13.560 the
00:02:13.590 butt

00:02:13.860 I
00:02:13.890 did
00:02:14.280 so
00:02:14.640 I
00:02:14.700 put
00:02:14.880 it
00:02:14.970 in
00:02:15.030 right
00:02:15.240 here
00:02:15.480 all

00:02:15.750 right
00:02:15.810 and
00:02:15.900 another
00:02:16.260 tip
00:02:16.500 besides
00:02:16.830 put
00:02:17.010 it
00:02:17.100 in

00:02:17.220 at
00:02:17.460 the
00:02:17.580 same
00:02:17.760 time
00:02:18.000 as
00:02:18.240 the
00:02:18.420 Greens
00:02:18.720 use

00:02:19.760 room-temperature
00:02:20.760 butter
00:02:20.910 my
00:02:21.630 butter
00:02:21.840 was

00:02:22.080 cold
00:02:22.410 and
00:02:22.740 rock-hard
00:02:23.130 so
00:02:23.970 it
00:02:24.090 was
00:02:24.180 really
00:02:24.480 hard

00:02:24.660 to
00:02:24.690 puree
00:02:24.990 in
00:02:25.110 here
00:02:25.440 so
00:02:25.740 this
00:02:25.830 took
00:02:25.980 me
00:02:26.130 like

00:02:26.160 three
00:02:26.460 or
00:02:26.580 four
00:02:26.700 minutes
00:02:27.000 if
00:02:27.180 your
00:02:27.510 butter

00:02:27.690 soft
00:02:27.960 this
00:02:28.080 is
00:02:28.140 only
00:02:28.290 gonna
00:02:28.440 taking
00:02:28.710 a
00:02:28.740 minute

00:02:28.980 anyway
00:02:29.310 regardless
00:02:30.000 puree
00:02:30.690 that
00:02:30.900 in
00:02:31.080 a

00:02:31.170 blender
00:02:31.470 until
