00:04:31.289 really
00:04:31.500 cheap
00:04:31.710 so

00:04:32.160 might
00:04:32.729 as
00:04:32.819 well
00:04:32.940 use
00:04:33.180 it
00:04:33.360 a
00:04:33.569 little
00:04:33.900 goes
00:04:34.139 a

00:04:34.169 long
00:04:34.289 way
00:04:34.650 but
00:04:35.069 it
00:04:35.310 really

00:04:35.759 make
00:04:35.789 a

00:04:36.030 difference
