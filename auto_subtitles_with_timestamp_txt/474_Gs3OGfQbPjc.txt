00:00:27.840 flour
00:00:28.140 now
00:00:28.769 this

00:00:28.949 gives

00:00:29.310 batter
00:00:29.519 some
00:00:29.760 nice
00:00:29.970 body
00:00:30.359 and

00:00:30.630 crunch
00:00:31.080 and
00:00:31.380 complements

00:00:32.340 corn
00:00:32.579 flour

00:00:32.850 well
00:00:34.730 so

00:00:57.780 half
00:00:57.989 an
00:00:58.170 hour

00:00:59.190 flour
00:00:59.460 can

00:01:06.510 the
00:01:06.720 center
00:01:07.049 rings
