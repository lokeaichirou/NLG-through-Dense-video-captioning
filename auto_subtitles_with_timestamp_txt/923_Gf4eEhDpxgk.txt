00:00:36.359 so
00:00:36.929 basically
00:00:37.230 all
00:00:37.350 you
00:00:37.469 need
00:00:37.679 is
00:00:37.890 eggs
00:00:38.249 and

00:00:38.550 butter
00:00:40.339 some
00:00:41.339 people
00:00:41.609 like
00:00:41.730 to
00:00:41.850 add
00:00:41.969 milk
00:00:42.929 or

00:00:43.140 water
00:00:43.379 to
00:00:43.620 their
00:00:43.739 eggs
00:00:44.000 personally
00:00:45.000 I
00:00:45.269 don't

00:00:45.539 really
00:00:45.719 notice
00:00:46.170 a
00:00:46.229 difference
00:00:46.589 when
00:00:46.890 I
00:00:46.920 do

00:00:47.039 that
00:00:47.280 so
00:00:47.729 you
00:00:48.299 can
00:00:48.329 do
00:00:48.570 it
00:00:49.159 I
00:00:50.159 don't
00:00:51.089 know
00:00:51.239 I

00:00:51.269 think
00:00:51.390 maybe
00:00:51.659 the
00:00:51.899 extra
00:00:52.320 liquid
00:00:52.469 just
00:00:52.799 helps

00:00:53.519 you
00:00:53.609 break
00:00:53.789 up
00:00:54.000 the
00:00:54.710 egg
00:00:55.710 more
00:00:56.039 better
00:00:56.789 I
00:00:57.119 don't

00:00:57.600 really
00:00:57.809 know

00:00:58.140 I've
00:00:58.500 heard
00:00:58.739 explanations
00:00:59.250 but
00:00:59.519 I
00:00:59.760 don't

00:00:59.969 necessarily
00:01:00.059 believe
00:01:00.629 it
00:01:00.780 anyway
00:01:01.739 it
00:01:02.250 is

00:01:02.399 important
00:01:02.879 to
00:01:02.909 get
00:01:03.149 some
00:01:03.719 air
00:01:03.989 mixed
00:01:04.799 into

00:01:05.070 your
00:01:05.189 eggs
00:01:05.339 so
00:01:05.700 when
00:01:06.000 you
00:01:06.830 eat
00:01:07.830 them
