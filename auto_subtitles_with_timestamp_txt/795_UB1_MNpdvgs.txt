00:02:09.970 spicy

00:02:10.330 but
00:02:10.780 it

00:02:11.500 bring
00:02:11.770 the
00:02:12.130 nice
00:02:12.310 flavor
00:02:13.050 so

00:02:14.050 let's
00:02:14.260 start
00:02:14.590 first
00:02:15.400 thing
00:02:15.490 we
00:02:15.760 will
00:02:15.880 do

00:02:16.420 slice
00:02:16.840 our
00:02:17.200 onion
00:02:17.680 I

00:02:21.430 it
00:02:21.670 on
00:02:21.910 small
00:02:22.570 pieces

00:02:22.780 so
00:02:23.770 I
00:02:23.800 don't

00:02:24.340 showed
00:02:24.850 you

00:04:22.220 ready
00:04:22.490 and
00:04:22.850 now
00:04:23.540 we
00:04:23.600 can
00:04:23.960 start
00:04:24.080 cooking
00:04:24.770 this

00:04:25.250 is
00:04:25.460 pretty
00:04:25.850 fast
00:04:26.180 meal

00:04:27.470 you
00:04:27.919 just
00:04:28.160 pretty
00:04:28.370 much
00:04:28.640 wait
00:04:28.910 till
00:04:29.330 the

00:04:29.600 potatoes
00:04:30.110 are
00:04:30.320 soft
00:04:30.560 and
00:04:30.980 then
00:04:31.430 it's
00:04:31.820 done

00:04:32.120 let's
00:04:32.810 add
00:04:32.990 one
00:04:33.140 tablespoon
00:04:33.890 of
00:04:33.919 oil
00:04:34.340 and
00:04:35.590 turn

00:04:36.590 on
00:04:36.770 the
00:04:37.210 flame
00:04:38.210 and
00:04:38.690 let's
00:04:39.380 fry
00:04:39.650 this
00:04:39.710 onions

00:04:41.560 and
00:04:42.560 you
00:04:42.710 will
00:04:42.890 have
00:04:43.070 to
00:04:43.660 steer
00:04:44.660 it
00:04:44.810 pretty

00:04:45.140 often
00:04:45.290 but
00:04:45.919 keep
00:04:46.280 it
00:04:46.430 on
00:04:46.550 high
00:04:46.790 because
00:04:47.419 if
00:04:47.750 you

00:04:47.900 do
00:04:48.080 it
00:04:48.200 on
00:04:48.350 low
00:04:48.560 then
00:04:49.250 onions
00:04:49.760 gets
00:04:50.090 cooked
00:04:50.479 but

00:04:51.050 doesn't
00:04:51.470 really
00:04:51.590 get
00:04:51.860 fried
00:04:52.280 and
00:04:52.490 crispy
00:04:53.139 the

00:04:54.139 onions
00:04:54.500 have
00:04:54.650 a
00:04:54.740 nice
00:04:55.040 color
00:04:55.430 so
00:04:56.120 the
00:04:56.360 pot
00:04:56.650 sees

00:04:57.650 but
00:04:57.979 this
00:04:58.130 is
00:04:58.340 stainless
00:04:58.669 steel
00:04:58.880 pot
00:04:59.330 and

00:04:59.660 that's
00:04:59.840 what
00:05:00.050 happens
00:05:00.440 but
00:05:00.710 it's
00:05:00.919 much

00:05:01.160 healthier
00:05:01.430 since
00:05:02.300 Teflon
00:05:02.870 so
00:05:03.860 let's
00:05:04.070 turn
00:05:04.310 off

00:05:04.490 the
00:05:04.810 flame
00:05:05.810 and
00:05:06.370 they'll
00:05:07.370 be
00:05:07.580 adding
00:05:08.060 2

00:05:08.479 tablespoons
00:05:09.289 of
00:05:09.860 paprika
00:05:10.340 and
00:05:10.970 you
00:05:11.270 don't

00:05:11.450 want
00:05:11.600 to
00:05:11.690 add
00:05:11.810 it
00:05:12.020 while
00:05:12.350 it's
00:05:12.590 on
00:05:12.830 the
00:05:12.979 flame

00:05:13.250 because
00:05:13.729 paprika
00:05:14.060 can
00:05:14.390 burn
00:05:14.690 and
00:05:15.050 then

00:05:15.200 becomes
00:05:16.039 bitter
00:05:16.400 we
00:05:17.390 are
00:05:17.450 adding
00:05:17.780 2

00:05:18.050 tablespoons
00:05:18.710 this
00:05:19.190 is
00:05:19.370 hard
00:05:19.640 to
00:05:19.789 measure

00:05:19.970 because
00:05:20.539 it's
00:05:20.720 hard
00:05:20.960 to
00:05:21.140 come
00:05:21.860 out
00:05:22.630 sometimes

00:05:23.630 you
00:05:23.780 make
00:05:23.990 a
00:05:24.020 big
00:05:24.229 mess
00:05:24.470 but
00:05:24.830 it's
00:05:25.400 ok
00:05:31.330 2

00:05:32.330 tablespoons
00:05:33.020 of
00:05:33.229 paprika
00:05:34.450 let's
00:05:35.450 do
00:05:35.780 it
00:05:35.960 a

00:05:35.990 little
00:05:36.200 bit
00:05:37.750 and
00:05:38.750 turn
00:05:39.020 on
00:05:39.229 the
00:05:39.470 flame
00:05:40.120 but
00:05:41.120 put

00:05:41.450 it
00:05:41.570 on
00:05:41.750 lower
00:05:42.530 what
00:05:43.220 number
00:05:43.580 6
00:05:43.910 because
00:05:44.810 we

00:05:45.050 wanted
00:05:45.560 a
00:05:45.830 little
00:05:46.580 bit
00:05:46.970 to
00:05:47.570 fry
00:05:47.930 it
00:05:47.990 but
00:05:48.620 don't

00:05:49.340 burn
00:05:49.729 it

00:05:51.570 to
00:05:52.570 give
00:05:52.780 a
00:05:52.810 better
00:05:53.110 flavour
00:05:54.270 just
00:05:55.270 a
00:05:55.450 little

00:05:55.780 bit
00:05:55.960 that's
00:05:56.170 good
00:05:56.530 and
00:05:56.860 now
00:05:56.920 let's
00:05:57.160 add
00:05:57.340 five

00:05:57.730 cups
00:05:57.760 of
00:05:58.270 water
00:06:08.130 with
00:06:09.130 the
00:06:09.250 flame
00:06:09.520 on
00:06:09.760 high

00:06:11.010 let's
00:06:12.010 add
00:06:12.250 more
00:06:12.280 ingredients
00:06:16.530 we
00:06:17.530 have
00:06:17.770 one

00:06:18.070 tablespoon
00:06:18.460 of
00:06:18.850 salt
00:06:19.180 a
00:06:21.210 little
00:06:22.210 bit
00:06:22.510 of

00:06:22.600 pepper
00:06:25.200 and
00:06:26.200 a
00:06:26.230 little
00:06:26.740 bit
00:06:27.040 of
00:06:27.370 cayenne

00:06:27.760 pepper
00:06:27.910 I
00:06:30.600 want
00:06:31.600 to
00:06:31.690 put
00:06:31.900 really
00:06:32.590 little
00:06:34.410 the

00:06:35.410 potatoes
00:06:36.660 doesn't
00:06:37.660 splash
00:06:49.380 you
00:06:50.380 can
00:06:50.590 add
00:06:50.770 also

00:06:51.010 the
00:06:51.300 Cabasa
00:06:52.300 so
00:06:52.570 it's
00:06:52.750 already
00:06:53.080 the
00:06:53.500 flavor

00:06:53.800 gets
00:06:54.070 into
00:06:55.410 into
00:06:56.410 the
00:06:56.590 calash
00:07:00.300 and
00:07:01.300 now
00:07:01.450 and

00:07:01.660 then
00:07:01.870 come
00:07:02.200 and
00:07:02.350 steer
00:07:02.770 it
00:07:02.800 and
00:07:03.760 wait
00:07:04.000 till
00:07:04.300 it

00:07:04.390 starts
00:07:04.690 to
00:07:04.990 boil
00:07:05.790 it
00:07:06.790 starts
00:07:07.210 to
00:07:07.390 boil
00:07:07.630 so

00:07:08.050 let's
00:07:08.290 add
00:07:08.500 one
00:07:08.670 tablespoon
00:07:09.670 of

00:07:11.710 organic
00:07:12.460 beef
00:07:13.090 base
00:07:13.980 without
00:07:14.980 msg
00:07:16.260 so

00:07:17.260 it's
00:07:17.470 not
00:07:18.400 bad
00:07:18.730 for
00:07:18.760 you
00:07:19.180 and
00:07:20.170 if
00:07:20.410 you
00:07:20.440 want
00:07:20.710 to

00:07:20.950 know
00:07:21.070 which
00:07:21.550 kind
00:07:21.820 of
00:07:22.000 music
00:07:22.390 you
00:07:22.600 can
00:07:22.660 go

00:07:23.020 under
00:07:23.920 the
00:07:24.100 video
00:07:24.400 click
00:07:24.700 on
00:07:24.820 the
00:07:24.880 link
00:07:25.180 and
00:07:25.570 I

00:07:25.720 have
00:07:26.340 products
00:07:27.340 that
00:07:28.000 I'm
00:07:28.180 using
00:07:28.420 and
00:07:29.020 you
00:07:29.170 can

00:07:29.380 purchase
00:07:29.620 it
00:07:29.920 put
00:07:30.910 it
00:07:31.030 on
00:07:31.180 lower
00:07:31.450 about
00:07:32.320 number

00:07:32.970 six
00:07:33.970 but
00:07:34.570 have
00:07:34.810 it
00:07:34.930 still
00:07:35.230 boiling
00:07:35.680 a
00:07:35.710 little

00:07:35.890 bit
00:07:36.750 now
00:07:37.750 we'll
00:07:38.080 wait
00:07:38.230 till
00:07:38.650 the
00:07:38.890 potatoes
00:07:39.610 are

00:07:39.880 almost
00:07:40.210 done
00:07:41.850 and
00:07:42.850 in
00:07:43.240 a
00:07:43.330 min
00:07:43.540 meantime
00:07:44.380 we

00:07:44.710 will
00:07:44.770 prepare
00:07:45.220 our
00:07:45.430 flour
00:07:45.880 mixture
00:07:46.350 for
00:07:47.350 our

00:07:47.470 flour
00:07:47.830 mixture
00:07:48.090 this
00:07:49.090 will
00:07:49.330 help
00:07:49.600 to
00:07:49.900 thicken

00:07:50.140 up
00:07:50.440 the
00:07:50.500 sauce
00:07:52.110 because
00:07:53.110 it's
00:07:53.470 not
00:07:53.800 a
00:07:53.830 soup
00:07:54.250 so

00:07:54.550 it
00:07:54.700 has
00:07:54.850 to
00:07:55.030 be
00:07:55.210 a
00:07:55.240 little
00:07:55.540 thicker
00:07:55.750 so
00:07:56.710 we
00:07:56.860 have

00:07:57.010 1
00:07:57.220 cup
00:07:57.250 of
00:07:57.490 water

00:07:58.550 and
00:07:58.880 half
00:07:59.240 cup
00:07:59.570 of
00:07:59.750 flour
00:07:59.810 let's
00:08:00.770 put
00:08:01.070 it
00:08:01.190 all

00:08:01.340 together
00:08:01.840 and
00:08:02.840 with
00:08:03.200 the
00:08:03.350 whisk
00:08:04.150 just
00:08:05.150 mix
00:08:05.420 it

00:08:05.600 together
00:08:09.040 so
00:08:10.040 I
00:08:10.100 don't
00:08:10.280 have
00:08:10.400 big
00:08:10.670 clumps
00:08:14.770 it

00:08:15.770 doesn't
00:08:16.220 take
00:08:16.400 long
00:08:16.430 and
00:08:17.060 the
00:08:17.270 potatoes
00:08:17.900 are

00:08:18.400 almost
00:08:19.400 done

00:08:20.000 so
00:08:20.480 now
00:08:20.630 that
00:08:20.690 we'll
00:08:20.900 be
00:08:21.080 adding
00:08:21.320 a
00:08:21.680 flour

00:08:22.010 mixture
00:08:22.490 I
00:08:22.820 recommend
00:08:23.780 using
00:08:24.050 using
00:08:24.800 this

00:08:25.070 strainer
00:08:25.900 because
00:08:27.490 you
00:08:28.490 don't
00:08:28.700 want
00:08:28.850 to
00:08:28.940 have
