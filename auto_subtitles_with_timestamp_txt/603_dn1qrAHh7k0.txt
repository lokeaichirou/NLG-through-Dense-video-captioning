00:00:08.970 white
00:00:09.269 bread
00:00:10.099 today
00:00:11.099 I'm
00:00:11.370 going
00:00:11.550 to
00:00:11.610 use

00:00:11.880 provolone
00:00:12.660 cheese
00:00:14.059 sometimes
00:00:15.059 I
00:00:15.269 use
00:00:15.509 sharp

00:00:15.929 cheese
00:00:17.119 American
00:00:18.119 cheese

00:00:20.449 it's
00:00:21.449 all
00:00:21.630 a
00:00:21.660 matter
00:00:21.960 of
00:00:22.369 choice
00:00:23.369 and
00:00:24.109 some

00:00:25.109 smart
00:00:25.500 balanced
00:00:26.010 buttery
00:00:26.910 spread
00:00:27.240 I
00:00:27.779 like
00:00:28.380 to

00:00:28.560 butter
00:00:28.830 the
00:00:29.099 bread
00:00:31.309 rather
00:00:32.309 than

00:00:32.880 the

00:00:33.000 butter
00:00:33.210 in
00:00:33.480 the
00:00:33.510 pan
00:00:39.050 it
00:00:40.050 seems
00:00:40.500 to
00:00:40.739 cover
00:00:40.980 the

00:00:41.250 bread
00:00:41.550 better
00:00:41.850 that
00:00:42.149 way

00:00:42.600 and
00:00:42.690 the
00:00:43.440 reason
00:00:43.770 why
00:00:43.920 I
00:00:43.950 use
00:00:44.070 frozen
00:00:44.640 bread
00:00:45.500 it

00:00:46.500 takes
00:00:46.800 a
00:00:46.920 little
00:00:47.070 longer
00:00:48.059 for
00:00:48.570 the
00:00:48.989 bread
00:00:49.200 to

00:00:49.379 cook
00:00:49.620 and
00:00:49.890 that
00:00:50.780 way
00:00:51.980 the
00:00:52.980 cheese
00:00:53.250 melts
00:00:53.789 also

00:00:55.460 place
00:00:56.460 one
00:00:56.760 slice
00:00:57.059 of
00:00:57.090 bread
00:00:57.300 in
00:00:57.809 the
00:00:58.170 pan

00:00:58.879 which

00:01:03.420 slices
00:01:04.080 of
00:01:04.260 provolone
00:01:05.040 I
00:01:08.150 like

00:01:09.330 flip

00:01:09.630 it
00:01:09.750 over
00:01:09.960 just
00:01:10.650 as
00:01:10.860 the
00:01:11.070 butter
00:01:11.250 starts
00:01:11.729 to

00:01:13.909 to
00:01:14.909 the
00:01:14.939 other
00:01:15.180 side
00:01:19.130 it
00:01:20.130 also
00:01:20.250 gives
00:01:20.729 the

00:01:20.939 cheese
00:01:23.479 time
00:01:24.479 to
