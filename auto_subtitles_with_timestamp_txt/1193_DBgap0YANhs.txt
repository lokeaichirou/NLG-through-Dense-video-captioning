00:04:19.030 pan
00:04:19.479 underneath
00:04:20.139 the

00:04:20.440 cooking
00:04:20.769 pot
00:04:21.010 so
00:04:21.459 that
00:04:21.489 the
00:04:21.729 heat
00:04:22.030 distributes

00:04:22.840 evenly
00:04:22.990 throughout
00:04:24.570 so
00:04:25.570 now
00:04:25.750 I
00:04:25.780 have

00:04:26.110 marinated
00:04:26.830 the
00:04:26.950 vegetables
00:04:27.520 for
00:04:27.669 a
00:04:27.729 good
00:04:28.000 15

00:04:28.419 to
00:04:28.600 20
00:04:28.930 minutes
00:04:29.320 so
00:04:29.680 I'm
00:04:29.770 just
00:04:29.979 going
00:04:30.160 to

00:04:30.220 sautee
00:04:30.520 them
00:04:30.880 now
00:04:31.090 so
00:04:31.780 just
00:04:32.440 put
00:04:32.830 it
00:04:32.979 on
00:04:33.190 medium

00:04:33.850 heat
00:04:35.070 I'm
00:04:36.600 going
00:04:37.600 to
00:04:37.930 add
00:04:38.140 two
00:04:38.530 tablespoons
00:04:39.280 of

00:04:39.550 regular
00:04:40.240 vegetable
00:04:40.510 oil
00:04:41.020 you
00:04:41.440 can
00:04:41.590 also
00:04:41.620 add

00:04:42.310 ghee
00:04:42.910 here
00:04:43.419 or
00:04:43.660 butter
00:04:45.120 and
00:04:47.250 once
00:04:48.250 the
00:04:48.550 oil

00:04:48.580 heats
00:04:49.180 up
00:04:49.390 I'm
00:04:49.600 going
00:04:49.840 to
00:04:49.960 add
00:04:50.260 the
00:04:50.830 ginger
00:04:51.669 and

00:04:51.880 the
00:04:52.000 garlic
00:04:52.030 just
00:04:52.840 to
00:04:52.960 remove
00:04:53.260 the
00:04:53.440 rawness

00:04:53.710 from
00:04:54.160 that

00:05:07.699 just
00:05:08.699 saute
00:05:08.999 it
00:05:09.240 for
00:05:09.270 a
00:05:09.479 couple
00:05:09.900 of
00:05:09.990 minutes

00:05:12.830 and
00:05:13.830 now
00:05:14.669 simply
00:05:15.120 flop
00:05:15.719 in
00:05:15.900 all
00:05:16.289 these

00:05:16.800 ingredients
00:05:17.400 into
00:05:18.240 the
00:05:18.629 pan

00:05:31.110 so
00:05:32.110 now
00:05:32.380 I'm
00:05:32.590 going
00:05:32.800 to
00:05:32.920 let
00:05:33.190 these
00:05:33.490 vegetables

00:05:34.270 cook
00:05:34.570 for
00:05:34.870 a
00:05:35.110 good
00:05:35.350 five
00:05:35.620 to
00:05:35.830 six
00:05:36.070 minutes
00:05:36.340 till

00:05:36.850 all
00:05:37.150 the
00:05:37.570 flavors
00:05:38.020 blend
00:05:38.350 in
00:05:38.770 while
00:05:39.310 I
00:05:39.430 prepare

00:05:39.670 the
00:05:40.000 rice
00:05:40.240 for
00:05:40.540 it
00:05:42.660 so
00:05:43.660 you
00:05:43.750 now
00:05:44.140 have
00:05:44.170 some

00:05:44.740 salted
00:05:45.550 cooked
00:05:45.910 rice
00:05:46.270 and
00:05:46.570 in
00:05:46.960 that
00:05:47.110 I've
00:05:47.290 put

00:05:47.470 some
00:05:47.680 sacral
00:05:48.250 so
00:05:48.670 good
00:05:49.000 tip
00:05:49.240 here
00:05:49.510 would
00:05:49.810 be
00:05:49.990 to

00:05:50.170 dissolve
00:05:50.680 the
00:05:50.890 saffron
00:05:51.370 in
00:05:51.580 some
00:05:51.820 milk
00:05:52.150 to

00:05:52.540 make
00:05:52.720 it
00:05:52.780 more
00:05:53.200 rich
00:05:53.620 and
00:05:53.800 so
00:05:54.160 that
00:05:54.340 the
00:05:54.460 color

00:05:54.760 and
00:05:55.120 the
00:05:55.330 flavor
00:05:55.360 spreads
00:05:56.110 evenly
00:05:56.710 so
00:05:57.400 here
00:05:57.640 I

00:05:57.670 have
00:05:57.820 the
00:05:58.150 rice
00:05:58.390 and
00:05:59.790 to
00:06:00.790 this
00:06:01.000 I
00:06:01.270 am
00:06:01.330 going
00:06:01.420 to

00:06:01.780 add
00:06:02.160 some
00:06:03.160 fried
00:06:03.910 onions
00:06:04.470 and
00:06:06.660 just
00:06:07.660 mix
00:06:08.140 it

00:06:08.380 nicely
00:06:08.620 and
00:06:10.200 remember
00:06:11.200 to
00:06:11.380 flavor
00:06:11.740 it
00:06:11.950 with

00:06:12.430 some
00:06:12.670 salt
00:06:13.000 at
00:06:13.240 this
00:06:13.450 point
00:06:13.720 in
00:06:13.900 time

00:06:14.080 otherwise
00:06:14.530 the
00:06:14.800 biryani
00:06:15.100 can
00:06:15.460 get
00:06:15.640 quite

00:06:15.910 bland
00:06:16.240 so
00:06:17.230 now
00:06:17.530 my
00:06:17.740 vegetables
00:06:18.400 are
00:06:18.670 almost

00:06:18.940 cooked
00:06:19.630 here
00:06:19.990 it
00:06:20.710 doesn't
00:06:20.980 take
00:06:21.250 much
00:06:21.580 time

00:06:21.850 because
00:06:22.090 we
00:06:22.330 already
00:06:22.570 parboil
00:06:23.500 our

00:06:23.770 vegetables
00:06:24.460 before
00:06:25.110 so
00:06:26.110 now
00:06:26.410 just
00:06:27.370 spread
00:06:27.790 it

00:06:27.940 evenly
00:06:28.420 in
00:06:29.020 a
00:06:29.140 layer
00:06:29.350 just
00:06:30.340 reduce
00:06:30.910 the

00:06:31.180 temperature
00:06:31.540 to
00:06:31.960 low
00:06:33.960 and
00:06:34.960 now
00:06:35.950 I'm
00:06:36.220 going
00:06:36.520 to

00:06:36.820 simply

00:06:42.750 so
00:06:43.750 it's
00:06:43.900 got

00:06:44.110 all
00:06:44.140 the
00:06:44.500 goodness
00:06:44.950 of
00:06:45.160 vegetables
00:06:45.940 you
00:06:46.240 can

00:06:46.390 add
00:06:46.660 ricotta
00:06:47.530 cheese
00:06:47.890 you
00:06:48.190 can
00:06:48.310 add
00:06:48.550 some

00:06:48.820 chicken

00:06:49.660 mean
00:06:50.140 whatever
00:06:50.380 you
