00:04:43.670 use
00:04:43.790 up

00:04:43.820 the
00:04:44.060 whole
00:04:44.210 can
00:04:44.420 because
00:04:44.690 i

00:04:45.140 have
00:04:45.350 a
00:04:45.380 use

00:04:46.970 shoots
00:04:47.210 other

00:04:47.870 in
00:04:48.020 this
00:04:48.170 recipe
00:04:48.530 but
00:04:48.860 if
00:04:48.950 you
00:04:49.040 want
00:04:49.220 to

00:04:49.280 use
00:04:49.430 less
00:04:49.670 it
00:04:49.880 to
00:04:50.210 you
00:04:50.360 you
00:04:50.510 can
00:04:50.690 use
00:04:50.810 less
00:04:52.300 so
00:04:53.300 I

00:04:53.330 brought
00:04:53.480 up
00:04:53.810 about
00:04:53.990 eight
00:04:54.350 or
00:04:54.380 nine
00:04:54.530 cups
00:04:54.920 of

00:04:55.130 chicken
00:04:55.310 stock
00:04:55.490 to
00:04:55.940 a
00:04:55.970 boil
00:04:56.300 and
00:04:56.600 I'm
00:04:57.170 going
00:04:57.320 to

00:04:57.350 add
00:04:57.440 the
00:04:57.680 chicken
00:04:57.950 the
00:04:58.340 mushrooms
00:04:58.820 the
00:04:59.150 bamboo

00:04:59.480 shoots
00:04:59.750 and
00:04:59.990 the
00:05:00.050 tofu
00:05:00.470 and
00:05:00.710 I'm
00:05:00.770 going
00:05:00.920 to

00:05:00.950 cook
00:05:01.130 them
00:05:01.310 for
00:05:01.340 a
00:05:01.550 few
00:05:01.700 minutes
00:05:01.880 until
00:05:02.090 the

00:05:02.360 chicken
00:05:02.510 is
00:05:02.750 cooked
00:05:02.810 through
00:05:03.580 so
00:05:04.580 the

00:05:04.730 chickens
00:05:05.090 cook
00:05:05.330 through
00:05:05.570 it
00:05:05.690 doesn't
00:05:05.870 take

00:05:06.080 long
00:05:06.110 because
00:05:06.500 it's
00:05:06.860 shredded
00:05:07.340 very
00:05:07.550 thin
00:05:07.850 I'm

00:05:08.390 going
00:05:08.660 to
00:05:08.720 add
00:05:08.840 a
00:05:08.870 quarter
00:05:09.260 cup
00:05:09.290 of
00:05:09.440 soy
00:05:09.740 sauce

00:05:10.060 I'm
00:05:11.060 using
00:05:11.330 low-sodium
00:05:11.600 you
00:05:12.230 can
00:05:12.410 use
00:05:12.530 full

00:05:12.710 sodium
00:05:13.160 and
00:05:13.340 I
00:05:14.060 have
00:05:14.240 a
00:05:14.270 quarter
00:05:14.600 cup
00:05:14.750 of
00:05:14.860 rice

00:05:15.860 vinegar
00:05:15.920 I
00:05:17.650 have
00:05:18.650 two
00:05:18.860 teaspoons
00:05:19.400 of
00:05:19.550 salt
00:05:19.820 and

00:05:20.120 three
00:05:20.360 teaspoons
00:05:20.690 of
00:05:20.960 sugar
00:05:21.040 but
00:05:22.040 you
00:05:22.430 want
00:05:22.610 to

00:05:22.670 taste
00:05:22.880 your
00:05:23.120 stock
00:05:24.020 see
00:05:24.440 how
00:05:24.530 salty
00:05:24.800 it
00:05:24.950 is
00:05:25.130 and

00:05:25.370 how
00:05:25.400 small
00:05:25.610 do
00:05:25.760 you
00:05:25.820 want
00:05:26.030 it
00:05:26.120 you
00:05:26.210 might
00:05:26.330 not

00:05:26.480 want
00:05:26.690 to
00:05:26.750 add
00:05:26.870 any
00:05:27.050 salt
00:05:27.290 because
00:05:27.590 the
00:05:27.770 sodium

00:05:28.750 from
00:05:29.050 the
00:05:29.200 soy
00:05:29.470 sauce
00:05:29.530 is
00:05:29.950 probably
00:05:30.730 funny
00:05:31.000 for

00:05:31.270 most
00:05:31.420 people
00:05:31.810 and
00:05:32.370 now
00:05:33.370 I'm
00:05:33.430 going
00:05:33.700 to
00:05:33.820 add

00:05:33.910 some
00:05:33.940 white
00:05:34.840 pepper
00:05:35.170 and
00:05:35.590 I'm
00:05:35.650 going
00:05:35.770 to
00:05:35.800 do

00:05:35.950 that
00:05:36.100 to
00:05:36.280 taste
00:05:36.550 it's
00:05:36.850 very
00:05:37.090 hot
00:05:37.480 so
00:05:37.900 just
00:05:38.290 be

00:05:38.440 careful
00:05:38.620 but
00:05:39.100 you
00:05:39.250 know
00:05:39.340 you
00:05:39.430 can
00:05:39.580 just
00:05:39.610 add
00:05:39.880 a

00:05:39.910 little
00:05:40.120 bit
00:05:40.330 taste
00:05:40.720 and
00:05:40.930 see
00:05:41.020 if
00:05:41.200 it's
00:05:41.350 hot

00:05:41.470 enough
00:05:41.500 for
00:05:41.890 you
00:05:41.980 and
00:05:42.280 then
00:05:42.550 I'll
00:05:42.610 show
00:05:42.670 you

00:05:42.880 the
00:05:43.000 next
00:05:43.120 step
00:05:43.650 so
00:05:44.650 I
00:05:44.680 added
00:05:45.040 about
00:05:45.340 a

00:05:45.400 teaspoon
00:05:46.180 of
00:05:46.600 white
00:05:46.810 pepper
00:05:47.020 to
00:05:47.650 mine
00:05:47.860 it's

00:05:48.460 pretty
00:05:48.700 spicy
00:05:49.000 so
00:05:50.010 you
00:05:51.010 really
00:05:51.550 just
00:05:51.580 have
00:05:51.850 to

00:05:51.970 taste
00:05:52.150 it
00:05:52.360 and
00:05:52.510 see
00:05:52.660 how
00:05:52.690 much
00:05:52.900 is
00:05:53.050 enough
00:05:53.260 for

00:05:53.320 you
00:05:53.560 just
00:05:53.800 go
00:05:54.430 slow
00:05:54.730 and
00:05:54.940 now
00:05:55.540 I
00:05:55.570 have
00:05:56.100 two

00:05:57.100 tablespoons
00:05:57.670 of
00:05:57.850 cornstarch
00:05:58.120 that
00:05:58.780 I
00:05:58.810 diluted

00:05:59.410 in
00:05:59.530 a
00:05:59.740 half
00:05:59.950 a
00:06:00.040 cup
00:06:00.070 of
00:06:00.250 cold
00:06:01.180 water
00:06:01.300 and
00:06:01.950 I'm

00:06:02.950 going
00:06:03.100 to
00:06:03.130 have
00:06:03.280 this
00:06:03.460 to
00:06:03.669 the
00:06:03.790 soup
00:06:04.060 and
00:06:04.330 it

00:06:04.660 should
00:06:04.840 thicken
00:06:05.080 it
00:06:05.290 up
00:06:05.410 if
00:06:05.680 it's
00:06:06.100 not
00:06:06.430 thick

00:06:06.700 enough
00:06:06.730 for
00:06:06.970 you
00:06:07.300 you
00:06:07.330 can
00:06:07.660 add
00:06:07.870 a
00:06:08.200 little
00:06:08.680 bit

00:06:08.860 more
00:06:09.040 corn
00:06:09.370 starch
00:06:09.700 I'm
00:06:10.030 going
00:06:10.210 to
00:06:10.270 let
00:06:10.390 it

00:06:10.419 cook
00:06:10.690 for
00:06:10.840 a
00:06:10.900 while
00:06:10.960 and
00:06:11.230 I'll
00:06:11.320 check
00:06:11.530 if
00:06:11.680 it's

00:06:11.800 thick
00:06:11.980 enough
00:06:12.010 for
00:06:12.250 me
00:06:13.650 so
00:06:14.650 I
00:06:14.680 ended
00:06:15.100 up
00:06:15.190 adding

00:06:15.490 another
00:06:15.940 tablespoon
00:06:16.419 of
00:06:16.810 cornstarch
00:06:17.169 that
00:06:17.650 I

00:06:17.680 diluted
00:06:18.160 with
00:06:18.250 a
00:06:18.310 tiny
00:06:18.580 bit
00:06:18.820 of
00:06:18.970 cold
00:06:19.690 water
00:06:19.900 it

00:06:20.680 thickens
00:06:21.220 it
00:06:21.340 it
00:06:21.460 makes
00:06:21.640 it
00:06:21.790 almost
00:06:21.910 that

00:06:22.360 gelatinous
00:06:22.830 consistency
00:06:23.830 that
00:06:23.950 you're
00:06:24.130 used

00:06:24.280 to
00:06:24.430 getting

00:06:26.860 like
00:06:26.980 it
00:06:27.160 to
00:06:27.340 goopy
00:06:27.730 and
00:06:28.050 it
00:06:29.050 also

00:06:29.200 depends
00:06:29.560 on
00:06:29.650 how
00:06:29.770 much
00:06:29.890 corn
00:06:30.190 starch
00:06:30.400 you

00:06:30.490 ended

00:07:38.539 stand
00:07:38.719 for
00:07:39.050 I

00:07:41.870 through
00:07:42.940 now

00:07:43.940 maybe
00:07:44.210 even
00:07:44.419 less
00:07:44.599 i
00:07:44.780 think
00:07:44.960 i
00:07:45.020 might
00:07:45.139 turn
00:07:45.319 it

00:07:45.440 off
00:07:45.530 in
00:07:45.680 a
00:07:45.740 few
00:07:45.770 seconds
00:07:46.250 and
00:07:46.400 when

00:07:51.080 it
00:07:51.409 to
00:07:51.740 taste
00:07:51.979 depends

00:07:52.909 you
00:07:53.090 like
00:07:53.270 sesame
00:07:53.750 oil
00:07:53.960 bit
00:07:54.229 i
00:07:54.409 think
00:07:55.400 it
00:07:55.520 makes

00:07:55.669 it
00:07:55.849 super
