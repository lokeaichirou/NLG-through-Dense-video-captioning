00:03:35.680 Buffalo

00:03:36.070 which
00:03:36.550 is
00:03:36.730 very
00:03:36.940 lean

00:03:40.330 even

00:03:40.510 tell

00:03:49.239 that
00:03:49.420 goes
00:03:49.630 in
00:03:51.120 and
00:03:52.120 now

00:03:52.390 I'm

00:04:07.299 overdo
00:04:07.750 it
00:04:07.780 because

00:04:08.019 then
00:04:08.830 it
00:04:09.130 won't
00:04:09.310 be
00:04:09.519 quite
00:04:09.760 as
00:04:09.880 soft

00:04:50.630 in
00:04:50.810 the

00:04:50.930 meat

00:04:51.320 that's
00:04:51.770 the
00:04:51.980 fact
00:04:52.250 that

00:05:01.910 it
00:05:02.740 try
00:05:03.740 to
00:05:03.800 make
00:05:04.010 it
00:05:04.130 about

00:05:05.560 now

00:05:07.210 this
00:05:08.210 is
00:05:08.360 going
00:05:08.480 to

00:05:13.220 the
00:05:13.550 safest

00:05:13.970 way
00:05:14.120 to
00:05:14.180 cook
00:05:14.480 it
00:05:14.630 is
00:05:14.750 to
00:05:14.960 know

00:05:16.010 sixty
00:05:16.280 degrees
00:05:16.580 inside
