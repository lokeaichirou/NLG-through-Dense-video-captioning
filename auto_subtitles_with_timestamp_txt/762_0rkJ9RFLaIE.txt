00:00:49.230 good
00:00:49.379 idea

00:00:49.829 use
00:00:49.950 the
00:00:50.100 low-sodium

00:00:50.550 because
00:00:50.910 we

00:01:06.040 little
00:01:06.280 bit

00:01:18.679 some
00:01:19.250 dry
00:01:19.460 pasta
00:01:20.000 so
00:01:20.659 use

00:01:21.079 whatever
00:01:21.289 you
00:01:21.560 have
00:01:21.590 on
00:01:21.770 hand
00:01:21.950 I'm

00:01:23.240 pasta
00:01:23.659 right
00:01:24.020 here
00:01:24.200 but
00:01:24.380 it
00:01:24.469 really

00:01:24.500 doesn't
00:01:24.859 matter
00:01:25.009 what
00:01:25.399 you
00:01:25.579 use
00:01:25.899 so
00:01:26.899 let's
00:01:27.200 go

00:01:27.409 ahead
00:01:27.500 and
00:01:27.619 get
00:01:27.799 started
00:01:27.920 cooking
00:01:28.549 that

00:01:28.670 recipe
00:01:29.409 okay
00:01:30.409 we're
00:01:30.619 going
00:01:30.710 to
00:01:30.770 begin
00:01:30.979 by

00:01:31.630 sweating
00:01:32.630 the
00:01:32.750 vegetables
00:01:32.780 so
00:01:33.380 that
00:01:33.799 means

00:01:33.979 we're
00:01:34.130 gonna
00:01:34.189 just
00:01:34.490 cook
00:01:34.670 up
00:01:34.819 the
00:01:35.539 celery
00:01:35.899 and

00:01:36.219 the
00:01:37.219 onions
00:01:37.579 and
00:01:37.789 everything
00:01:38.079 until
00:01:39.079 the

00:01:39.170 onions
00:01:39.560 are
00:01:39.799 translucent
00:01:42.549 now
00:01:43.549 I'm
00:01:43.729 sweating

00:01:44.030 them
00:01:44.270 in
00:01:44.509 a
00:01:44.750 couple
00:01:45.109 of
00:01:45.170 tablespoons
00:01:45.740 of

00:01:46.219 butter
00:01:46.609 you
00:01:46.700 can
00:01:47.090 use
00:01:47.149 vegetable
00:01:47.840 oil
00:01:48.039 both

00:01:49.039 work
00:01:49.340 equally
00:01:49.819 as
00:01:50.000 well
00:01:52.599 this
00:01:53.599 is
00:01:53.750 at
00:01:53.899 a
00:01:53.929 medium

00:01:54.500 to
00:01:55.250 a
00:01:55.280 medium-high
00:01:56.030 heat

00:02:00.579 so
00:02:01.579 my
00:02:01.700 onions
00:02:02.119 are
00:02:02.270 almost
00:02:02.479 translucent
00:02:03.289 and

00:02:03.890 I'm
00:02:04.009 gonna
00:02:04.129 go
00:02:04.340 ahead
00:02:04.459 and
00:02:04.579 add
00:02:04.969 in
00:02:05.299 my
00:02:05.509 ground

00:02:05.840 meat
00:02:06.319 I'm
00:02:07.250 using
00:02:07.520 a
00:02:07.759 really
00:02:08.239 lean
00:02:08.979 ground
00:02:09.979 meat

00:02:10.369 so
00:02:10.970 I'm
00:02:11.180 not
00:02:11.299 gonna
00:02:11.450 drain
00:02:11.959 this
00:02:12.140 but
00:02:12.379 if

00:02:12.470 you're
00:02:12.590 using
00:02:13.510 something
00:02:14.510 that's
00:02:17.230 fifteen
00:02:18.230 or

00:02:18.500 twenty
00:02:18.890 percent
00:02:19.040 fat
00:02:19.579 in
00:02:19.940 your
00:02:20.239 hamburger

00:02:20.750 meat
00:02:20.930 you
00:02:21.079 may
00:02:21.260 want
00:02:21.500 to
00:02:21.530 go
00:02:21.620 ahead
00:02:21.799 and
00:02:21.889 drain

00:02:22.100 this
00:02:22.310 but
00:02:22.730 again
00:02:22.970 this
00:02:23.150 is
00:02:23.680 extremely
00:02:24.680 lean
00:02:25.329 so

00:02:26.329 we're
00:02:26.480 just
00:02:26.630 gonna
00:02:26.720 break
00:02:26.989 this
00:02:27.170 up
00:02:27.380 and
00:02:27.680 let

00:02:28.190 it
00:02:28.250 brown
00:02:28.340 for
00:02:28.700 a
00:02:28.760 few
00:02:28.940 minutes
00:02:29.209 and
00:02:29.420 then

00:02:29.690 we'll
00:02:29.870 add
00:02:30.079 in
00:02:30.109 everything
00:02:30.680 else
00:02:31.220 don't
00:02:31.880 be

00:02:32.090 concerned
00:02:32.510 that
00:02:32.720 the
00:02:32.930 meat
00:02:33.139 isn't
00:02:33.560 fully

00:02:33.769 cooked
00:02:34.099 at
00:02:34.250 this
00:02:34.400 point

00:02:34.790 the
00:02:35.209 soups
00:02:35.450 gonna
00:02:35.660 cook
00:02:35.900 for
00:02:35.930 an
00:02:36.170 additional

00:02:36.530 45
00:02:36.950 minutes
00:02:37.459 so
00:02:37.700 by
00:02:37.849 the
00:02:37.910 time
00:02:38.239 the
00:02:38.450 soups
00:02:38.660 done

00:02:38.900 the
00:02:39.530 meat
00:02:39.739 will
00:02:39.859 be
00:02:39.980 cooked
00:02:40.010 thoroughly
00:02:40.430 okay

00:02:41.209 we're
00:02:41.510 gonna
00:02:41.630 begin
00:02:41.989 by
00:02:42.049 adding
00:02:42.470 everything

00:02:43.220 else
00:02:43.400 into
00:02:43.730 our
00:02:43.849 pot
00:02:44.090 and
00:02:44.450 again
00:02:45.230 that's
00:02:45.470 two

00:02:45.739 jars
00:02:46.040 of
00:02:46.250 marinara
00:02:46.880 sauce
00:02:47.620 the
00:02:48.620 mirin
00:02:48.650 era

00:02:49.160 sauce
00:02:49.459 helps
00:02:50.000 flavor
00:02:50.299 the
00:02:50.540 soup
00:02:50.780 itself
00:02:51.319 so

00:02:51.680 you
00:02:51.739 don't
00:02:51.980 have
00:02:52.160 to
00:02:52.340 worry
00:02:52.609 about

00:03:59.570 a
00:03:59.990 low

00:04:00.230 sodium
00:04:00.500 cause

00:04:01.910 over
00:04:02.180 salted
00:04:02.660 even
00:04:02.959 before
00:04:03.110 you
00:04:03.320 get
00:04:03.440 the

00:04:03.530 chance
00:04:03.560 to
00:04:04.010 season
00:04:04.340 it
00:04:04.430 yourself
00:04:04.820 I
00:04:05.330 raise
00:04:05.930 now

00:04:06.320 we're

00:04:07.100 pasta
00:04:07.610 if
00:04:07.910 you

00:04:13.130 just
00:04:13.370 before

00:04:14.630 sometimes
00:04:15.020 freezing
