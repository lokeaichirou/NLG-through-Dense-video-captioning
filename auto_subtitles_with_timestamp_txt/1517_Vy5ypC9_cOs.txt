00:02:10.000 Korean
00:02:10.390 red
00:02:10.690 pepper
00:02:10.930 paste
00:02:11.230 and
00:02:11.560 this
00:02:11.920 is
00:02:12.070 just

00:02:12.250 a
00:02:12.310 very
00:02:12.490 common
00:02:12.940 Korean
00:02:13.390 condiment
00:02:14.050 try

00:02:14.590 saying
00:02:14.860 that
00:02:15.070 five
00:02:15.250 times
00:02:15.400 fast
00:02:15.610 but
00:02:16.390 I
00:02:16.420 see
00:02:16.660 it

00:02:16.750 a
00:02:16.780 lot
00:02:16.990 in
00:02:17.170 Korean
00:02:17.470 cuisine
00:02:17.560 whether
00:02:17.980 it's

00:02:18.160 just
00:02:18.340 on
00:02:18.520 its
00:02:18.700 own
00:02:18.880 or
00:02:19.270 if
00:02:19.720 you
00:02:20.020 mix
00:02:20.320 other

00:02:20.530 things
00:02:20.800 into
00:02:20.950 it
00:02:21.130 to
00:02:21.220 kind
00:02:21.430 of
00:02:21.490 enhance
00:02:21.850 the

00:02:22.060 flavor
00:02:22.300 I
00:02:22.600 like
00:02:22.900 to
00:02:23.020 add
00:02:23.140 honey
00:02:23.470 as
00:02:23.650 a

00:02:23.680 sweetener
00:02:24.070 because
00:02:24.790 on
00:02:24.970 its
00:02:25.210 own

00:02:25.570 go
00:02:25.690 to
00:02:25.810 Thanh
00:02:25.960 is
00:02:26.140 kind
00:02:26.410 of
00:02:26.440 sweet
00:02:26.590 but
00:02:26.890 it's

00:02:27.010 mostly
00:02:27.280 salty
00:02:27.760 and
00:02:27.910 spicy
00:02:28.120 and
00:02:28.690 then
00:02:29.050 I
00:02:29.110 do
00:02:29.200 add

00:02:29.590 a
00:02:29.620 tiny
00:02:30.130 bit
00:02:30.340 of
00:02:30.370 soy
00:02:30.580 sauce
00:02:30.640 but
00:02:31.090 that's

00:02:31.240 totally
00:02:31.690 optional
00:02:31.810 and
00:02:32.320 unnecessary
00:02:32.920 because

00:02:33.010 like
00:02:33.250 I
00:02:33.340 said
00:02:33.400 it's
00:02:33.760 already
00:02:34.060 pretty
00:02:34.240 salty
00:02:34.600 on

00:02:34.630 its
00:02:34.900 own
00:02:35.020 and
00:02:35.260 just
00:02:35.290 eyeball
00:02:36.040 it
00:02:36.070 or
00:02:36.310 do
00:02:36.460 it
00:02:36.580 to

00:02:36.700 taste
00:02:36.910 because
00:02:37.150 sometimes
00:02:37.960 I
00:02:38.080 make
00:02:38.260 it
00:02:38.440 with
00:02:38.650 a

00:02:38.710 little
00:02:38.920 less
00:02:39.190 honey
00:02:39.460 or
00:02:39.820 make
00:02:40.210 it
00:02:40.330 with
00:02:40.480 little

00:02:40.720 more
00:02:40.990 sesame
