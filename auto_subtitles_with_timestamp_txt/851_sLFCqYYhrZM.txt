00:01:14.230 together
00:01:14.530 we
00:01:15.340 didn't
00:01:15.610 want
00:01:15.730 to
00:01:15.760 do

00:01:15.970 that
00:01:16.240 because

00:03:14.800 this
00:03:15.070 all

00:03:15.280 together

00:03:17.200 make
00:03:17.320 sure
00:03:17.530 that
00:03:17.680 the

00:03:18.720 garlic

00:03:19.989 the
00:03:20.260 Dijon
00:03:20.620 mustard
00:03:20.830 and
00:03:21.340 the

00:03:21.489 anchovy
00:03:22.000 is
00:03:22.060 well
00:03:22.270 mixed

00:03:25.090 whisking
00:03:25.390 I'm
00:03:26.290 going
00:03:26.440 to
00:03:26.530 drizzle
00:03:26.800 in
00:03:27.100 some

00:03:27.640 good
00:03:27.880 quality
00:03:28.330 extra
00:03:28.480 virgin
00:03:28.720 olive
00:03:29.110 oil
00:03:30.660 now

00:03:31.660 looks
00:03:32.050 great
00:03:33.209 like
00:03:34.209 that
00:03:34.480 but
00:03:35.470 now
00:03:35.590 for
00:03:35.770 this

00:03:35.920 we're
00:03:36.430 going
00:03:36.610 to
00:03:36.760 add
00:03:36.910 in
00:03:37.060 our
00:03:37.150 freshly
00:03:37.750 grated

00:03:37.930 parmigiano
00:03:38.590 Reggiano
00:03:39.040 I
00:03:39.430 grade
00:03:40.030 it
00:03:40.180 ahead
00:03:40.300 of

00:03:40.450 time
00:03:40.720 just
00:03:41.020 to
00:03:41.080 save
00:03:41.290 on
00:03:41.440 time
00:03:41.739 now
00:03:42.430 I
00:03:42.790 think

00:03:43.420 this
00:03:43.810 is
00:03:44.020 most
00:03:44.530 common
00:03:45.040 for
00:03:45.070 a
00:03:45.310 Caesar

00:03:45.670 dressing
00:03:45.790 but
00:03:46.209 I
00:03:46.239 do
00:03:46.330 know
00:03:46.660 that
00:03:46.870 some
00:03:47.110 places

00:03:47.350 have
00:03:48.070 like
00:03:48.400 a
00:03:48.430 Mayo
00:03:49.270 based

00:03:49.810 Caesar
00:03:50.260 dressing
00:03:50.470 I
00:03:50.860 personally
00:03:51.370 don't
00:03:51.580 care

00:03:51.670 for
00:03:51.970 that
00:03:52.030 that's
00:03:52.720 why
00:03:52.900 I
00:03:52.930 make
00:03:53.200 my
00:03:53.350 own
00:03:53.380 so

00:03:54.280 this
00:03:54.400 is
00:03:54.550 how
00:03:54.670 I
00:03:54.700 like
00:03:55.000 it

00:03:55.300 I
00:03:55.450 control
00:03:55.930 what's
00:03:56.140 in
00:03:56.350 it
00:03:56.500 and
00:03:57.190 that's
00:03:57.310 pretty

00:03:57.610 much
00:03:57.760 how
00:03:57.970 I
00:03:58.000 roll
00:03:58.300 so
00:03:59.200 now
00:03:59.470 I
00:03:59.500 don't
00:03:59.650 to
00:03:59.860 do
00:03:59.950 is

00:04:00.070 I
00:04:00.130 want
00:04:00.280 to
00:04:00.370 taste
00:04:00.640 it
00:04:00.940 now
00:04:01.630 I'm
00:04:01.750 not
00:04:01.780 seasoning

00:04:02.410 it
00:04:02.530 yet
00:04:02.800 I'm
00:04:03.220 going
00:04:03.340 to
00:04:03.430 taste
00:04:03.640 it
00:04:03.850 first

00:04:07.080 perfect
00:04:08.080 so
00:04:08.470 I
00:04:08.500 know
00:04:08.680 how
00:04:09.220 much
00:04:09.340 I
00:04:09.670 much
00:04:10.390 salt

00:04:10.660 to
00:04:10.720 put
00:04:10.780 in
00:04:11.110 because
00:04:11.500 the
00:04:11.650 anchovy
00:04:12.160 paste
00:04:12.310 is

00:04:12.489 of
00:04:12.610 course
00:04:12.820 salty
00:04:13.239 and
00:04:13.420 the
00:04:13.600 cheese
00:04:13.840 is
00:04:14.019 salty

00:04:14.230 so
00:04:14.590 I
00:04:14.830 don't
00:04:15.190 want
00:04:15.310 to
00:04:15.340 go
00:04:15.459 blindly
00:04:15.910 into
00:04:16.269 it

00:04:16.419 and
00:04:16.600 season
00:04:17.410 it
00:04:17.470 so

00:04:17.680 just
00:04:17.799 give
00:04:17.950 it
00:04:18.070 a

00:04:18.130 slight
00:04:18.430 taste
00:04:19.769 so
00:04:20.769 good
00:04:21.010 it
00:04:21.280 is
00:04:21.489 just

00:04:21.519 delicious

00:04:26.140 I've

00:04:37.729 the
00:04:37.909 anchovy
00:04:38.360 paste

00:04:38.690 because
