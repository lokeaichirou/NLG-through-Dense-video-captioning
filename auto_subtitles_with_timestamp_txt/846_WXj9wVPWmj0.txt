00:00:00.000 all
00:00:00.810 right
00:00:00.989 here
00:00:01.140 we
00:00:01.260 go
00:00:01.380 with
00:00:01.410 our
00:00:01.620 croak

00:00:01.979 monster
00:00:02.580 my
00:00:03.240 favorite
00:00:03.959 open-faced
00:00:04.529 sandwich

00:00:05.040 and
00:00:05.460 I
00:00:05.970 had
00:00:06.540 that
00:00:06.720 cheesy
00:00:07.020 beige
00:00:07.290 smell

00:00:07.560 leftover
00:00:08.099 so
00:00:09.000 here's
00:00:09.240 I'm
00:00:09.360 going
00:00:09.480 to
00:00:09.540 do
00:00:09.630 with

00:00:09.750 it
00:00:09.840 I'm
00:00:09.960 going
00:00:10.050 to
00:00:10.139 take
00:00:10.260 a
00:00:10.290 leave
00:00:10.800 on
00:00:10.980 bread

00:00:11.490 this
00:00:11.670 is
00:00:11.730 just
00:00:11.969 a
00:00:12.059 classic
00:00:12.920 French
00:00:13.920 country

00:00:14.639 loaf
00:00:15.000 of
00:00:15.240 bread
00:00:15.480 the
00:00:15.870 round
00:00:16.199 oval
00:00:16.619 kind
00:00:17.279 round

00:00:17.910 oval
00:00:18.150 I
00:00:18.270 guess
00:00:18.449 it's
00:00:19.080 got
00:00:19.230 to
00:00:19.320 be
00:00:19.380 one
00:00:19.529 or
00:00:19.560 the

00:00:19.920 I
00:00:20.070 guess
00:00:20.430 it's
00:00:20.609 round
00:00:20.820 so
00:00:21.600 we're
00:00:21.689 going
00:00:21.779 to
00:00:21.869 cut

00:00:22.020 four
00:00:22.430 nice
00:00:23.430 big
00:00:23.820 thick
00:00:24.480 slices
00:00:24.720 right
00:00:25.230 out
00:00:25.380 of

00:00:25.410 the
00:00:25.590 center
00:00:25.769 so
00:00:26.039 I'm
00:00:26.130 not
00:00:26.220 going
00:00:26.340 to
00:00:26.430 use
00:00:26.550 the

00:00:26.699 two
00:00:26.880 end
00:00:27.060 pieces
00:00:28.250 all
00:00:29.250 right
00:00:30.500 now
00:00:31.500 important

00:00:32.040 since
00:00:32.250 we're
00:00:32.340 going
00:00:32.430 to
00:00:32.550 throw
00:00:33.149 these
00:00:33.270 in
00:00:33.390 the

00:00:33.480 oven
00:00:33.570 they
00:00:33.780 got
00:00:33.899 to
00:00:33.989 be
00:00:34.050 the
00:00:34.140 same
00:00:34.290 thickness

00:00:34.920 otherwise
00:00:35.460 you
00:00:35.910 know
00:00:36.030 one's
00:00:36.360 going
00:00:36.540 to
00:00:36.570 cook

00:00:36.780 faster
00:00:37.140 than
00:00:37.290 the
00:00:37.410 other
00:00:37.530 so
00:00:37.770 those
00:00:38.579 are
00:00:38.700 good

00:00:38.910 3/4
00:00:39.450 of
00:00:39.510 an
00:00:39.629 inch
00:00:39.719 thick
00:00:40.020 I'm
00:00:40.680 going
00:00:40.860 to

00:00:40.920 drizzle
00:00:41.129 about
00:00:41.340 I
00:00:41.730 don't
00:00:41.879 know
00:00:41.940 tablespoon

00:00:42.660 olive
00:00:42.780 oil
00:00:43.079 on
00:00:43.260 one
00:00:43.770 side
00:00:44.070 I'm
00:00:44.219 going
00:00:44.309 to
00:00:44.370 flip

00:00:44.610 them
00:00:44.730 over
00:00:45.710 all
00:00:46.710 right
00:00:46.860 so
00:00:47.730 there's
00:00:47.940 olive
00:00:48.510 oil

00:00:48.629 on
00:00:48.870 the
00:00:49.079 bottom
00:00:49.820 I'm
00:00:50.820 going
00:00:51.000 to
00:00:51.090 take
00:00:51.329 my

00:00:51.629 cheesy
00:00:52.320 bechamel
00:00:53.010 sauce
00:00:53.039 now
00:00:53.520 if
00:00:53.940 you
00:00:54.329 don't

00:00:54.480 know
00:00:54.690 where
00:00:55.199 I
00:00:55.230 got
00:00:55.469 that
00:00:55.710 or
00:00:55.890 how
00:00:55.980 that
00:00:56.190 came

00:00:56.399 to
00:00:56.460 be
00:00:56.579 you
00:00:56.969 got
00:00:57.120 to
00:00:57.180 watch
00:00:57.390 two
00:00:57.690 clips
00:00:58.230 on
00:00:58.530 the

00:00:58.649 site
00:00:58.890 the
00:00:59.100 bechamel
00:00:59.699 clip
00:01:00.300 and
00:01:00.539 then
00:01:01.289 the

00:01:01.410 beginning
00:01:01.770 of
00:01:02.100 the
00:01:02.280 cheese
00:01:02.850 souffle
00:01:03.300 clip

00:01:03.629 where
00:01:03.840 I
00:01:03.870 added
00:01:04.260 the
00:01:04.379 cheese
00:01:04.619 so
00:01:05.519 it's

00:01:05.640 basically
00:01:05.880 a
00:01:06.000 cheese
00:01:06.510 infused
00:01:07.200 I
00:01:07.530 use
00:01:07.680 creer

00:01:08.310 cheese
00:01:08.939 infused
00:01:09.890 time
00:01:10.890 scented
00:01:11.520 bechamel

00:01:14.580 of
00:01:14.729 these
00:01:14.820 slices
00:01:15.770 so
00:01:16.770 that's
00:01:16.920 about
00:01:17.100 a
00:01:17.159 half
00:01:17.430 a

00:01:17.580 cup
00:01:17.610 of

00:01:18.630 to
00:01:18.689 spread

00:01:18.900 between
00:01:19.290 four
00:01:19.590 so
00:01:20.180 if
00:01:21.180 my
00:01:21.450 math
00:01:21.720 serves
00:01:22.229 me

00:01:22.470 correctly

00:01:23.640 eighth
00:01:23.759 of
00:01:23.880 a
00:01:23.970 cup

00:01:24.500 all
00:01:25.500 right
00:01:25.619 now
00:01:26.520 here's
00:01:26.700 an
00:01:26.820 important
