00:04:12.650 masala
00:04:13.130 to
00:04:13.370 cook
00:04:13.930 with
00:04:14.930 along
00:04:15.350 with
00:04:15.380 the

00:04:15.590 mutton
00:04:16.070 and
00:04:16.280 we
00:04:16.580 leave
00:04:16.760 it
00:04:16.850 on
00:04:16.970 slowly
00:04:17.299 so
00:04:18.140 that

00:04:18.170 it
00:04:18.560 can
00:04:18.799 cook
00:04:19.070 gradually
00:04:20.110 Reggie

00:04:28.270 so
00:04:28.810 this
00:04:28.990 will
00:04:29.169 cook
00:04:29.350 for
00:04:29.590 about
00:04:29.680 15
00:04:30.100 to
00:04:30.250 20

00:04:30.610 minutes
00:04:30.910 probably
00:04:31.300 20
00:04:31.780 and
00:04:32.910 there's
00:04:33.910 no
00:04:34.060 water

00:04:34.300 added

00:04:36.490 the
00:04:36.580 tomato

00:04:36.910 puree
00:04:39.419 so
00:04:40.419 this
00:04:40.630 is
00:04:40.780 how
00:04:40.990 our
00:04:41.289 mutton
00:04:42.130 looks

00:04:42.870 it's
