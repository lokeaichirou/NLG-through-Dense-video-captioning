00:02:58.940 think
00:02:59.390 you
00:03:00.079 should
00:03:00.319 avoid
00:03:00.760 low-fat
00:03:01.760 milk

00:03:02.060 because
00:03:02.750 it's
00:03:02.959 not
00:03:03.379 going
00:03:03.560 to
00:03:03.680 have
00:03:03.799 enough
00:03:04.129 of

00:03:04.310 the
00:03:04.579 milk
00:03:05.180 fat
00:03:05.480 to
00:03:05.840 keep
00:03:06.140 the
00:03:06.319 dish
00:03:06.560 creamy
00:03:06.980 so

00:03:07.670 right
00:03:07.909 now
00:03:08.090 I'm
00:03:08.209 just
00:03:08.269 going
00:03:08.599 to
00:03:08.750 let
00:03:08.930 this
00:03:09.140 get

00:03:09.470 hot
00:03:09.769 and
00:03:10.489 I'm
00:03:11.299 going
00:03:11.599 to
00:03:11.750 stir
00:03:12.280 stir
00:03:13.280 this
00:03:13.430 is
00:03:13.579 a

00:03:13.609 dish
00:03:13.879 that
00:03:13.909 must
00:03:14.269 be
00:03:14.390 stirred
00:03:15.400 this
00:03:16.400 part

00:03:19.400 that
00:03:19.730 you
00:03:19.879 stay

00:03:22.099 so
00:03:22.430 that

00:03:36.609 you
00:03:37.609 don't
00:03:37.760 want

00:03:37.910 to

00:06:00.120 in
00:06:00.540 the
00:06:00.980 macaroni

00:06:01.980 so
00:06:02.730 I
00:06:03.060 would
00:06:03.510 say
00:06:03.660 I'm
00:06:03.720 going
00:06:03.870 to
00:06:03.960 use
00:06:04.050 about

00:06:04.169 that
00:06:04.500 much
00:06:04.560 and
00:06:05.190 the
00:06:05.940 macaroni
00:06:06.480 I
00:06:06.570 just
00:06:06.900 want

00:06:07.560 deck
00:06:07.919 give
00:06:08.220 the
00:06:08.370 macaroni
00:06:08.880 a
00:06:09.000 little
00:06:09.300 extra

00:06:09.750 flavor
00:06:12.050 so
00:06:13.050 it's
00:06:13.140 just
00:06:13.350 trying
00:06:13.530 to
00:06:13.560 give
00:06:13.710 the

00:06:13.800 macaroni
00:06:14.310 just
00:06:14.610 a
00:06:14.700 little
00:06:14.910 bit
00:06:15.030 of
00:06:15.120 extra

00:06:15.480 buttery
00:06:16.020 flavor
00:06:16.380 not
00:06:17.310 a
00:06:17.370 lot
00:06:17.640 and
00:06:18.180 as
00:06:18.330 you
00:06:18.450 can

00:06:18.570 see
00:06:18.810 again
00:06:18.960 this
00:06:19.380 is
00:06:19.560 a
00:06:19.590 small
00:06:20.040 serving
00:06:20.580 I'm

00:06:20.700 making
00:06:21.560 and
00:06:22.560 honestly
00:06:23.280 I
00:06:23.310 think
00:06:23.580 I've

00:06:24.000 probably
00:06:24.300 made
00:06:24.810 too
00:06:25.110 much
00:06:25.320 of
00:06:25.500 the
00:06:25.590 cheese

00:06:25.860 sauce
00:06:26.190 but
00:06:27.000 that's
00:06:27.210 okay
00:06:27.630 it
00:06:27.900 does
00:06:28.080 keep
00:06:28.380 very

00:06:28.800 well
00:06:29.070 and
00:06:29.400 again
00:06:30.030 like
00:06:30.270 I
00:06:30.450 said
00:06:30.750 you
00:06:30.930 can
00:06:31.140 use

00:06:42.250 wanted
