00:01:02.940 up
00:01:03.030 this
00:01:03.149 step

00:01:20.369 tough
00:01:20.549 you

00:01:36.119 explain
00:01:36.600 in

00:01:41.490 the

00:01:41.640 exact
00:01:41.970 same
00:01:42.000 reasons
00:01:42.540 we

00:01:42.990 don't
00:01:43.229 use

00:01:43.290 fresh
00:01:43.649 tomatoes
00:01:43.799 for
00:01:44.220 tomato

00:01:50.399 them

00:01:51.060 and
00:01:51.210 that
00:01:51.600 would
00:01:51.689 be
00:01:51.780 fine

00:02:02.340 little
00:02:02.460 bit
00:02:02.700 I'm

00:02:03.240 going
00:02:03.329 to
00:02:03.390 go
00:02:03.479 with
00:02:03.600 some
00:02:03.750 freshly
00:02:04.140 ground

00:02:04.469 black
00:02:04.619 pepper
00:02:04.740 a
00:02:05.460 little
00:02:06.060 touch
00:02:06.329 of
00:02:06.360 cayenne

00:02:06.810 and
00:02:07.170 a
00:02:07.770 little
00:02:08.039 bit
00:02:08.160 of
00:02:08.280 paprika
00:02:08.810 I'm
00:02:09.810 using

00:02:10.020 the
00:02:10.140 plain
00:02:10.349 but
00:02:10.530 I
00:02:10.560 have
00:02:10.709 used
00:02:10.920 the
00:02:11.009 smoked

00:02:11.250 paprika
00:02:11.430 before
00:02:12.030 in
00:02:12.120 this
00:02:12.209 and
00:02:12.450 it
00:02:12.510 is
00:02:12.629 lovely

00:02:12.900 at
00:02:13.200 this

00:02:13.920 I
00:02:13.950 probably
00:02:14.310 had
00:02:14.490 a
00:02:14.550 little
00:02:14.670 more
00:02:14.910 salt
00:02:15.150 also

00:02:15.660 but
00:02:15.900 my
00:02:16.020 chicken
00:02:16.350 broth
00:02:16.650 was
00:02:16.950 perfectly

00:02:18.030 so
00:02:18.569 I'll
00:02:18.690 taste
00:02:18.900 and
00:02:19.050 adjust
00:02:19.110 for
00:02:19.319 that
00:02:19.500 later

00:02:19.709 and
00:02:20.100 besides
00:02:20.910 the
00:02:21.000 salt
00:02:21.240 I'll
00:02:21.390 warn
00:02:21.540 you
00:02:21.660 right

00:02:21.690 now
00:02:21.959 we're
00:02:22.170 also
00:02:22.319 going
00:02:22.530 to
00:02:22.590 add
00:02:22.709 some
00:02:22.740 sugar

00:02:23.040 to
00:02:23.280 this
00:02:23.400 very
00:02:24.300 critical
00:02:24.540 ingredients
00:02:25.319 but

00:02:25.680 I'm
00:02:25.740 going
00:02:25.860 to
00:02:25.920 wait
00:02:26.010 on
00:02:26.160 that
00:02:26.190 too
00:02:26.569 okay
00:02:27.569 so

00:02:27.810 all
00:02:28.260 we're
00:02:28.380 gonna
00:02:28.470 do
00:02:28.620 is
00:02:28.650 simply
00:02:28.980 wait
00:02:29.100 for

00:02:29.130 this
00:02:29.340 to
00:02:29.400 come
00:02:29.610 up
00:02:29.640 to
00:02:29.850 a
00:02:29.880 simmer

00:02:30.390 at
00:02:30.959 which
00:02:31.080 point
00:02:31.110 we're
00:02:31.350 going
00:02:31.440 to
00:02:31.500 stir
00:02:31.709 in

00:02:31.830 the
00:02:31.890 ingredient
00:02:32.370 that
00:02:32.520 really
00:02:32.760 makes
00:02:33.000 this
00:02:33.150 a

00:02:33.209 bisque
00:02:33.630 and
00:02:34.020 that
00:02:34.140 would
00:02:34.290 be
00:02:34.440 the
00:02:34.620 rice
00:02:34.830 so

00:02:35.760 we're
00:02:35.880 gonna
00:02:35.970 stir
00:02:36.150 in
00:02:36.209 about
00:02:36.300 three

00:02:36.630 tablespoons
00:02:36.750 of
00:02:37.290 regular
00:02:37.500 white
00:02:37.920 long
00:02:38.310 grain

00:02:38.610 rice
00:02:38.840 actually
00:02:39.840 used
00:02:39.989 a
00:02:40.050 variety
00:02:40.230 of
00:02:40.410 rice

00:02:40.590 called
00:02:40.830 jasmine
00:02:41.190 but
00:02:41.940 really
00:02:42.150 anything
00:02:42.360 will

00:02:42.600 work
00:02:42.630 and
00:02:43.260 just
00:02:43.380 like
00:02:43.560 saying
00:02:43.739 Jasmine

00:02:44.160 jasmine
00:02:45.060 its
00:02:45.540 we're
00:02:45.660 stirring
00:02:45.900 the
00:02:46.110 rice
00:02:46.140 and

00:02:46.800 that's
00:02:47.040 what's
00:02:47.220 going
00:02:47.310 to
00:02:47.370 thicken
00:02:47.550 up
00:02:47.760 this

00:02:47.940 soup
00:02:48.150 but
00:02:48.330 it's
00:02:48.450 going
00:02:48.570 to
00:02:48.630 be
00:02:48.810 silky
00:02:49.350 not

00:02:49.680 starchy
00:02:50.400 which
00:02:50.850 is
00:02:50.970 kind
00:02:51.150 of
00:02:51.180 funny
00:02:51.360 because

00:02:51.510 we're
00:02:51.720 adding
00:02:51.840 starch
00:02:52.200 but
00:02:52.500 it's
00:02:52.590 not
00:02:52.709 going

00:02:52.800 to
00:02:52.890 be
00:02:52.950 that
00:02:53.070 kind
00:02:53.190 of
00:02:53.310 starch
00:02:53.550 and
00:02:53.670 as
00:02:53.790 you
00:02:53.910 get

00:02:54.090 if
00:02:54.209 you
00:02:54.300 add
00:02:54.390 a
00:02:54.420 whole
00:02:54.630 bunch
00:02:54.810 of
00:02:54.900 flour
00:02:55.140 based

00:02:55.440 Roux
00:02:55.739 or
00:02:55.980 cornstarch
00:02:56.640 and
00:02:57.390 that's
00:02:57.540 another

00:02:57.780 thing
00:02:57.870 I'll
00:02:58.110 talk
00:02:58.230 about
00:02:58.290 more
00:02:58.620 on
00:02:58.650 the
00:02:58.769 blog

00:02:58.950 post
00:02:59.220 and
00:02:59.459 then
00:02:59.940 the
00:03:00.060 game
00:03:00.209 plan
00:03:00.480 here
00:03:00.690 is
00:03:00.750 I

00:03:00.840 want
00:03:01.019 you
00:03:01.050 to
00:03:01.140 adjust
00:03:01.320 the
00:03:01.680 heat
00:03:01.980 down
00:03:02.550 to
00:03:02.610 low

00:03:02.820 medium
00:03:03.810 low
00:03:04.019 which
00:03:04.410 ever
00:03:04.590 provides
00:03:05.010 you
00:03:05.160 with

00:03:05.250 a
00:03:05.400 nice
00:03:05.640 steady
00:03:06.000 simmer
00:03:06.390 and
00:03:06.720 while
00:03:07.320 that's

00:03:07.500 simmering
00:03:07.650 if
00:03:07.920 you
00:03:08.010 want
00:03:08.160 to
00:03:08.220 skim
00:03:08.430 any
00:03:08.459 foam

00:03:08.790 off
00:03:09.030 or
00:03:09.330 any
00:03:09.450 of
00:03:09.510 the
00:03:09.570 fat
00:03:09.750 that
00:03:09.780 rises
00:03:10.260 to
00:03:10.290 the

00:03:10.739 feel
00:03:11.100 free
00:03:11.310 this
00:03:12.000 is
00:03:12.060 not
00:03:12.300 my
00:03:12.480 biscuits
00:03:12.959 your

00:03:13.080 bisque
00:03:13.350 so
00:03:14.040 I
00:03:14.070 did
00:03:14.340 do
00:03:14.430 a
00:03:14.459 little
00:03:14.640 bit
00:03:14.760 of

00:03:14.850 recreational
00:03:15.480 skimming
00:03:15.930 and
00:03:16.110 all
00:03:16.650 we're

00:03:16.769 going
00:03:16.860 to
00:03:16.920 do
00:03:17.070 is
00:03:17.190 let
00:03:17.340 that
00:03:17.489 simmer
00:03:17.790 for
00:03:18.060 about

00:03:18.180 35
00:03:18.720 to
00:03:18.959 45
00:03:19.350 minutes
00:03:19.650 or
00:03:20.070 until
00:03:20.220 the
00:03:20.459 rice
00:03:20.640 and

00:03:20.820 vegetables
00:03:21.239 are
00:03:21.360 absolutely
00:03:21.870 as
00:03:22.079 soft
00:03:22.350 as

00:03:22.530 they
00:03:22.680 can
00:03:22.860 be
00:03:23.010 and
00:03:23.190 the
00:03:23.640 mixture
00:03:23.880 should
00:03:24.150 look

00:03:24.329 something
00:03:24.570 similar
00:03:25.079 to
00:03:25.230 this
00:03:25.380 now
00:03:25.950 at
00:03:26.040 this

00:03:26.100 point

00:03:26.970 all

00:03:27.090 the
00:03:27.150 way
00:03:27.239 down
00:03:27.480 to
00:03:27.660 low
00:03:27.840 and
00:03:28.140 we're
00:03:28.890 going

00:03:32.549 tasting

00:03:32.700 four
00:03:33.030 sugar

00:03:33.480 all
00:03:33.720 right
00:03:33.870 depending
00:03:34.079 on
00:03:34.260 how
00:03:34.410 sweet
00:03:34.470 your

00:03:34.829 tomatoes

00:03:37.260 here
00:03:37.650 you
00:03:38.459 may

00:03:38.610 actually
00:03:38.820 need
00:03:39.000 a
00:03:39.150 couple
00:03:39.480 teaspoons
00:03:39.660 in

00:03:43.140 tested
00:03:43.560 mine
00:03:43.739 I
00:03:44.100 stirred
00:03:44.430 in

00:03:44.760 sugar
00:03:44.940 and
00:03:45.239 some
00:03:45.420 salt
00:03:45.660 but
00:03:46.500 I'm
00:03:46.620 not
00:03:46.769 done

00:03:47.010 after

00:03:47.850 we're
00:03:48.180 going
00:03:48.299 to

00:03:48.360 adjust
00:03:48.600 this
00:03:48.780 again
00:03:49.019 at
00:03:49.140 the
00:03:49.260 end
00:03:49.350 and
00:03:49.739 then

00:03:50.400 we're
00:03:50.489 going
00:03:50.579 to
00:03:50.640 take
00:03:50.790 our
00:03:50.970 immersion

00:03:51.420 blender
00:03:51.780 and
00:03:52.170 we're
00:03:52.950 going
00:03:53.070 to
00:03:53.130 very

00:03:53.370 carefully
00:03:53.910 blend
00:03:54.239 this
00:03:54.390 absolutely
00:03:55.170 smooth

00:03:55.500 all
00:03:56.459 right
00:03:56.549 this
00:03:56.670 is
00:03:56.820 obviously
00:03:57.269 edited
00:03:57.780 but

00:03:58.650 you're
00:03:58.769 going
00:03:58.890 to
00:03:58.950 let
00:03:59.070 that
00:03:59.100 blend
00:03:59.340 for
00:03:59.549 at

00:03:59.640 least
00:03:59.760 a
00:03:59.970 few
00:04:00.120 minutes
00:04:00.239 until
00:04:01.230 it's
00:04:01.650 as
00:04:01.769 smooth

00:04:02.070 as
00:04:02.250 silk
00:04:02.430 and
00:04:02.880 because
00:04:03.420 of
00:04:03.450 the
00:04:03.600 rice
00:04:03.750 in
00:04:03.930 there

00:04:04.049 the
00:04:04.200 appearance
00:04:04.560 is
00:04:04.650 going
00:04:04.769 to
00:04:04.860 change
00:04:05.160 from

00:05:36.060 I've
00:05:36.150 ever
00:05:36.300 done

00:05:36.510 and
