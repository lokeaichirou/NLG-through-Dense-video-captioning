00:03:19.569 dip

00:03:23.970 definitely
00:03:24.970 big
00:03:25.180 fillets
00:03:25.480 not
00:03:25.720 sticks
00:03:26.049 or

00:03:26.319 Nuggets
00:03:26.709 and
00:03:27.670 that's
00:03:27.849 for
00:03:28.030 the
00:03:28.090 chips
00:03:28.390 well

00:03:28.660 they're
00:03:29.140 not
00:03:29.260 the
00:03:29.349 kind
00:03:29.379 of
00:03:29.709 potato
00:03:30.040 chip

00:03:30.579 normally
00:03:31.060 associate
00:03:31.569 with
00:03:31.750 that
00:03:31.780 word
00:03:32.140 rather

00:03:32.950 they're
00:03:33.160 fresh
00:03:33.549 russet
00:03:34.150 potatoes
00:03:34.599 and
00:03:34.900 those

00:03:35.349 would
00:03:35.560 be
00:03:35.620 Idaho
00:03:36.280 potatoes
00:03:36.700 which
00:03:37.269 are

00:03:37.450 generally
00:03:37.810 cut
00:03:37.989 into
00:03:38.319 fat
00:03:38.860 sticks
00:03:39.310 there
00:03:40.090 I

00:03:40.629 french
00:03:41.079 fries
00:03:41.319 and
00:03:41.620 then
00:03:42.519 double

00:03:42.879 fried
00:03:43.120 but
00:03:43.660 more
00:03:44.140 about

00:03:44.349 later
00:03:44.500 with

00:03:45.459 that

00:03:45.849 how
00:03:46.299 about
00:03:46.420 we
00:03:46.629 give
00:03:46.930 it
00:03:47.049 a
00:03:47.109 toss

00:03:47.290 let's
00:03:48.280 head

00:03:53.109 are
00:03:53.140 beyond
00:03:53.739 simple
00:03:54.220 so

00:03:54.879 you
00:03:54.970 might
00:03:55.090 be
00:03:55.120 tempted
00:03:55.269 to
00:03:55.720 add
00:03:55.840 additional

00:03:55.989 ingredients
00:03:56.680 to
00:03:56.769 make
00:03:56.920 it
00:03:56.950 better
00:03:57.190 don't
00:03:58.150 it

00:03:58.720 really
00:03:58.870 won't
00:03:59.290 improve
00:03:59.620 these
00:03:59.739 recipes
00:04:00.190 extra

00:04:00.970 ingredients

00:04:04.120 do
00:04:04.269 I
00:04:04.359 use
00:04:04.599 while
00:04:05.410 the
00:04:05.560 two
00:04:05.709 most

00:04:05.890 common

00:04:06.579 used
00:04:07.030 for

00:04:11.230 I
00:04:11.260 prefer
00:04:11.650 Cod
00:04:11.950 and
00:04:12.250 apparently

00:04:12.730 so

00:04:19.599 inch

00:04:19.630 thick
00:04:19.989 the

00:04:20.979 itself
00:04:21.130 is
00:04:21.489 very
00:04:21.789 easy

00:04:22.090 just
00:04:23.050 place
00:04:23.349 1
00:04:23.650 cup
00:04:23.889 of

00:04:31.810 of

00:04:32.169 beer

00:04:32.860 would
00:04:33.070 be
00:04:33.160 about
00:04:33.280 a
00:04:33.460 cup
00:04:33.789 the

00:04:34.599 final
00:04:34.930 consistency
00:04:35.710 should
00:04:35.889 be
00:04:36.250 that
00:04:36.430 of
00:04:36.460 a

00:04:36.610 thin
00:04:36.910 pancake
00:04:37.479 batter
00:04:37.710 pretty

00:04:39.780 hey

00:04:40.780 let's
00:04:41.620 talk

00:04:42.010 it
00:04:42.160 for
00:04:42.280 a
00:04:42.340 second
00:04:42.729 first

00:04:43.570 of
00:04:43.750 all
00:04:43.900 for

00:04:45.310 diet
00:04:45.370 you're
00:04:46.210 in
00:04:46.300 luck
00:04:46.479 because
00:04:46.780 rice
00:04:47.500 flour

00:04:47.830 and
00:04:48.099 a
00:04:48.190 gluten-free
00:04:48.580 beer
00:04:48.970 will
00:04:49.120 actually

00:04:50.110 and
00:04:50.200 by
00:04:50.740 the
00:04:50.800 way
00:04:50.889 regular
00:04:51.430 Budweiser
00:04:51.820 or
00:04:52.180 Bud

00:04:52.419 Light
00:04:52.630 are
00:04:52.840 said
00:04:53.050 not
00:04:53.260 to
00:04:53.410 be
00:04:53.500 gluten
00:04:53.770 free
00:04:54.039 but

00:04:54.580 there
00:04:54.700 are
00:04:54.820 others
00:04:55.060 that
00:04:55.090 are
00:04:55.380 speaking
00:04:56.380 of

00:04:57.010 I
00:04:57.039 prefer
00:04:57.789 nail
00:04:58.030 like
00:04:58.900 this
00:04:59.080 one
00:04:59.289 it
00:04:59.800 doesn't

00:05:00.099 have
00:05:00.280 to
00:05:00.430 be
00:05:00.550 English
00:05:00.820 but
00:05:00.849 what
00:05:01.240 the
00:05:01.360 heck
00:05:01.599 it

00:05:01.780 can't
00:05:01.960 hurt
00:05:02.139 huh
00:05:02.380 a
00:05:02.699 pilsner
00:05:03.699 bill
00:05:03.970 will
00:05:04.090 also

00:05:04.479 work
00:05:04.630 well
00:05:04.870 but
00:05:05.050 I'd
00:05:05.199 stay
00:05:05.410 away
00:05:05.440 from
00:05:05.590 stouts

00:05:06.099 I
00:05:06.280 find
00:05:06.520 them
00:05:06.639 a
00:05:06.669 little
00:05:07.060 too
00:05:07.270 bitter
00:05:07.660 and
00:05:08.110 it

00:05:08.410 ruins
00:05:08.680 the
00:05:08.770 delicate
00:05:09.130 flavor
00:05:09.340 of
00:05:09.550 the
00:05:09.669 fish

00:05:10.199 whichever
00:05:11.199 beer
00:05:11.470 you
00:05:11.590 choose
00:05:11.860 though
00:05:12.039 I

00:05:12.070 recommend
00:05:12.340 you
00:05:12.760 allow
00:05:13.030 the
00:05:13.090 finnish
00:05:13.510 batter

00:05:13.750 to
00:05:14.020 rest
00:05:14.260 about
00:05:14.409 an
00:05:14.620 hour
00:05:14.770 before
00:05:15.159 using
00:05:15.520 it

00:05:15.789 this
00:05:16.330 will
00:05:16.539 reduce
00:05:16.659 some
00:05:16.990 of
00:05:17.020 the
00:05:17.169 fizziness

00:05:18.120 gives
00:05:18.240 you
00:05:18.330 a
00:05:18.360 better
00:05:18.570 crust
00:05:18.900 in
00:05:19.080 the
00:05:19.110 end
00:05:19.320 next

00:05:20.250 to
00:05:20.940 egg
00:05:21.210 or
00:05:21.660 not
00:05:21.960 to
00:05:22.139 egg
00:05:22.350 well
00:05:23.130 you
00:05:23.460 may
00:05:23.580 find

00:05:23.820 that
00:05:23.910 some
00:05:24.000 batter
00:05:24.449 recipes
00:05:25.020 call
00:05:25.500 for
00:05:25.530 an
00:05:25.740 egg

00:05:25.889 mine
00:05:26.550 doesn't
00:05:26.790 it's
00:05:27.510 not
00:05:27.690 necessary
00:05:28.260 granted

00:05:29.010 an
00:05:29.160 egg
00:05:29.310 can
00:05:29.460 help
00:05:29.669 the
00:05:29.790 batter
00:05:29.970 to
00:05:30.150 stick
00:05:30.180 to

00:05:30.510 the
00:05:30.600 fish
00:05:30.780 a
00:05:30.960 little
00:05:31.290 bit
00:05:31.410 better
00:05:31.590 but
00:05:32.130 the

00:05:32.220 downside
00:05:32.430 is
00:05:32.760 that
00:05:32.940 it
00:05:33.240 can
00:05:33.360 also
00:05:33.510 make
00:05:33.780 the

00:05:33.930 crust
00:05:34.229 more
00:05:34.500 doughy
00:05:34.800 and
00:05:34.979 less
00:05:35.280 crisp
00:05:35.690 okay
00:05:36.690 my

00:05:37.290 batter
00:05:37.530 is
00:05:37.740 rested
00:05:38.160 for
00:05:38.310 about
00:05:38.490 an
00:05:38.610 hour

00:05:39.000 let's
00:05:39.389 go
00:05:39.540 fry
00:05:39.750 some
00:05:39.990 fish
00:05:40.020 you
00:05:40.650 know
00:05:40.740 you're

00:05:40.889 going
00:05:40.979 to
00:05:41.070 find
00:05:41.330 it's
00:05:42.330 a
00:05:42.600 whole
00:05:42.720 lot
00:05:42.960 easier

00:05:42.990 than
00:05:43.650 you
00:05:43.800 think

00:05:45.650 okay
00:05:46.650 I
00:05:46.680 know
00:05:46.949 I'm
00:05:47.460 lucky
00:05:47.699 to
00:05:47.940 have
00:05:47.970 a
00:05:48.090 deep
00:05:48.360 fat

00:05:48.600 fryer
00:05:48.960 but
00:05:49.470 you
00:05:49.949 don't
00:05:50.130 need
00:05:50.310 one
00:05:50.460 in
00:05:50.550 your

00:05:50.669 home
00:05:50.880 just
00:05:51.510 simply
00:05:51.990 take
00:05:52.169 a
00:05:52.199 medium
00:05:52.770 sized

00:05:53.010 saucepan
00:05:53.400 in
00:05:54.060 about

00:05:54.300 quart
00:05:54.780 of
00:05:54.870 canola
00:05:55.199 oil

00:05:55.289 or
00:05:55.590 vegetable
00:05:55.800 oil
00:05:56.100 and

00:06:27.479 well
00:06:27.599 on

00:06:27.990 sides
00:06:28.289 this
00:06:28.950 batter
00:06:29.220 like
00:06:29.520 I

00:06:29.639 said
00:06:29.820 before
00:06:29.970 is
00:06:30.240 about
00:06:30.479 the
00:06:30.630 thickness
00:06:30.930 of
00:06:31.289 a

00:06:31.710 thin
00:06:32.490 pancake
00:06:33.060 batter
00:06:33.210 we're

00:06:33.990 drip
00:06:34.289 off
00:06:34.470 that's
00:06:34.680 important
00:06:35.220 because

00:06:35.639 if
00:06:35.970 you
00:06:36.150 leave
00:06:36.720 all

00:06:39.510 into
00:06:39.750 the
00:06:39.990 oil
00:06:40.020 what's
00:06:40.620 going
00:06:40.740 to

00:06:40.770 happen
00:06:41.160 is
00:06:41.280 all
00:06:41.310 that
00:06:41.669 batter
00:06:41.849 is
00:06:41.970 going
00:06:42.090 to

00:06:42.150 kind
00:06:42.330 of
00:06:42.360 blow
00:06:42.570 off
00:06:42.780 the
00:06:42.990 side
00:06:43.169 of
00:06:43.289 the
00:06:43.380 fillet

00:06:43.650 and
00:06:43.770 that's
00:06:43.919 not
00:06:44.070 good
00:06:44.310 so
00:06:44.520 we've
00:06:45.060 shaken
00:06:45.389 this

00:06:45.660 a
00:06:45.750 little
00:06:45.870 bit
00:06:46.080 just
00:06:47.010 very
00:06:47.250 carefully
00:06:48.260 lower

00:06:49.260 it
00:06:49.500 into
00:06:49.770 the
00:06:50.370 fat
00:06:51.830 I'm
00:06:52.830 not
00:06:53.070 letting
00:06:53.310 it
00:06:53.370 touch

00:06:53.550 the
00:06:53.580 bottom
00:06:53.970 quite
00:06:54.180 yet
00:06:54.389 until
00:06:54.630 it
00:06:54.720 starts
00:06:55.050 to

00:06:55.139 firm
00:06:55.380 up
00:06:55.560 then
00:06:55.889 I'm
00:06:56.190 going
00:06:56.310 to
00:06:56.340 just
00:06:56.490 kind

00:07:03.570 or
00:07:03.630 two
00:07:03.660 they're
00:07:03.810 going

00:07:04.500 little
00:07:04.800 bit
00:07:04.919 and
00:07:05.130 that's
00:07:05.280 because
00:07:05.580 the
