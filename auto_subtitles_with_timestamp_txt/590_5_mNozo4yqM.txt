00:00:38.190 melt
00:00:38.340 some

00:00:38.489 butter

00:00:48.660 this
00:00:48.840 step

00:00:49.020 first
00:00:49.350 because
00:00:49.860 this
00:00:49.980 mixture
00:00:50.250 will
00:00:50.399 need

00:00:51.270 into
00:00:51.539 the

00:00:59.370 cloves
00:00:59.609 and
00:01:00.270 we're
00:01:00.390 not
00:01:00.480 even

00:01:00.870 really
00:01:01.109 cook
00:01:01.260 this
00:01:01.469 we're
00:01:01.710 just

00:01:37.770 technically

00:02:56.010 you're

00:03:07.379 soaked
00:03:07.799 crumbs

00:03:08.549 because
00:03:09.060 dry
00:03:09.269 crumbs
00:03:09.599 pull

00:03:09.810 moisture
00:03:10.139 away
00:03:10.260 from
00:03:10.379 the

00:03:11.549 use
00:03:11.700 moist
00:03:11.970 crumbs

00:03:28.379 gonna
00:03:28.470 keep
00:03:28.650 mixing

00:03:29.730 that
00:03:29.970 at
00:03:30.569 which
00:03:30.720 point
00:03:30.750 we're
00:03:31.049 going
00:03:31.139 to

00:03:31.199 transfer
00:03:31.590 that
00:03:31.620 into
00:03:31.919 a
00:03:32.010 lightly
00:03:32.430 greased

00:03:32.730 baking
00:03:32.940 dish
00:03:33.329 are
00:03:33.930 you
00:03:34.019 something
00:03:34.349 nice
00:03:34.590 and

00:03:34.739 large
00:03:34.949 a
00:03:35.069 couple
00:03:35.370 inches
00:03:35.459 deep
00:03:35.760 is
00:03:35.940 perfect

00:03:36.329 and
00:03:36.629 then
00:03:37.019 what
00:03:37.109 you're
00:03:37.199 gonna
00:03:37.290 do
00:03:37.410 is
00:03:37.470 you're

00:03:37.560 going
00:03:37.650 to
00:03:37.739 wet
00:03:37.859 your
00:03:38.010 hands
00:03:38.400 and
00:03:38.579 form

00:03:39.419 into
00:03:39.690 the
00:03:39.810 classic
00:03:40.410 loaf
00:03:40.709 shape
00:03:41.069 so
00:03:41.730 I
00:03:41.760 think

00:03:41.849 about
00:03:42.060 four
00:03:42.269 or
00:03:42.359 five
00:03:42.480 inches
00:03:42.510 across

00:03:43.260 perfect
00:03:43.680 and
00:03:43.980 about
00:03:44.489 three
00:03:44.699 inches
00:03:44.910 higher
00:03:45.090 or

00:03:45.209 so
00:03:45.389 and
00:03:46.019 by
00:03:46.109 the
00:03:46.169 way
00:03:46.319 a
00:03:46.349 cake
00:03:46.620 might
00:03:46.829 be
00:03:46.949 fine

00:03:47.220 to
00:03:47.730 hide
00:03:47.879 a
00:03:47.910 small
00:03:48.180 little
00:03:48.449 file
00:03:48.660 in
00:03:48.930 but
00:03:49.590 with

00:03:49.709 the
00:03:49.799 size
00:03:49.949 and
00:03:50.160 shape
00:03:50.310 of
00:03:50.459 this
00:03:50.549 thing
00:03:50.790 you

00:03:50.910 could
00:03:51.090 totally
00:03:51.239 hide
00:03:51.540 a
00:03:51.569 hacksaw
00:03:52.099 allegedly

00:03:53.099 but
00:03:53.940 anyway
00:03:54.180 we're
00:03:54.299 going
00:03:54.389 to
00:03:54.480 go
00:03:54.569 ahead
00:03:54.660 and

00:03:54.840 manipulate
00:03:54.930 that
00:03:55.470 meat
00:03:55.709 mixture
00:03:56.040 and
00:03:56.310 to
00:03:56.699 an

00:03:56.819 appropriately
00:03:57.359 shaped
00:03:57.569 loaf
00:03:57.840 and
00:03:58.139 then
00:03:58.470 if

00:03:58.590 you
00:03:58.680 want
00:03:58.859 you
00:03:58.980 could
00:03:59.069 bake
00:03:59.220 it
00:03:59.340 just
00:03:59.549 like

00:03:59.699 that
00:03:59.909 but
00:04:00.569 personally
00:04:00.750 I
00:04:01.019 do
00:04:01.079 like
00:04:01.319 to
00:04:01.349 glaze

00:04:01.650 my
00:04:01.829 meat
00:04:02.010 loaves
00:04:02.220 and/or
00:04:03.150 cook
00:04:03.389 them
00:04:03.510 in
00:04:03.599 sauce

00:04:03.870 and
00:04:04.349 because
00:04:04.919 I
00:04:04.949 am
00:04:05.010 doing
00:04:05.250 a
00:04:05.430 meatball

00:04:05.609 inspired
00:04:06.090 version
00:04:06.329 I
00:04:06.780 decided
00:04:07.409 to
00:04:07.500 go
00:04:07.590 with

00:04:07.709 the
00:04:07.799 tomato
00:04:08.069 sauce
00:04:08.310 and
00:04:08.699 the
00:04:09.000 reason
00:04:09.239 it's

00:04:09.359 that
00:04:09.510 color
00:04:09.750 is
00:04:09.870 because
00:04:10.049 I
00:04:10.109 added
00:04:10.319 some

00:04:10.470 balsamic
00:04:10.919 vinegar
00:04:11.280 which
00:04:11.819 I
00:04:11.940 thought
00:04:12.090 would

00:04:12.209 be
00:04:12.329 totally
00:04:12.690 amazing
00:04:13.169 which
00:04:13.680 was
00:04:13.949 totally
00:04:14.340 not

00:04:14.519 amazing
00:04:15.030 but
00:04:15.569 I'll
00:04:15.659 talk
00:04:15.780 about
00:04:15.840 that
00:04:16.049 in
00:04:16.199 the

00:04:16.380 blog
00:04:16.560 post
00:04:16.829 I'm
00:04:17.430 gonna
00:04:17.609 recommend
00:04:17.820 you
00:04:18.090 just

00:04:18.239 use
00:04:18.449 your
00:04:18.479 favorite
00:04:18.780 tomato
00:04:19.019 sauce
00:04:19.409 but

00:04:19.949 anyway
00:04:20.190 I
00:04:20.220 ladle
00:04:20.549 that
00:04:20.579 into
00:04:20.940 my
00:04:21.060 dish
00:04:21.269 as
00:04:21.630 well

00:04:22.200 as
00:04:22.320 over
00:04:22.530 the
00:04:22.560 top
00:04:22.680 and
00:04:23.219 in
00:04:23.520 addition
00:04:23.909 to

00:04:23.940 flavor
00:04:24.270 and
00:04:24.479 color
00:04:24.690 it's
00:04:25.320 also
00:04:25.500 going
00:04:25.680 to
00:04:25.740 make

00:04:25.860 for
00:04:26.039 a
00:04:26.099 beautifully
00:04:26.580 moist
00:04:26.849 cooking

00:04:28.169 which
00:04:28.350 always
00:04:28.590 works
00:04:28.830 when
00:04:29.070 baking
00:04:29.280 me
00:04:29.520 loaf

00:04:29.699 and
00:04:30.270 once
00:04:30.449 we've
00:04:30.570 covered
00:04:30.750 that
00:04:30.960 surface
00:04:31.320 in

00:04:31.500 the
00:04:31.590 sauce
00:04:31.800 we're
00:04:32.460 going
00:04:32.580 to
00:04:32.639 go
00:04:32.729 ahead
00:04:32.820 and

00:04:33.000 transfer
00:04:33.330 that
00:04:33.360 into
00:04:33.630 the
00:04:33.750 center
00:04:34.199 of
00:04:34.229 a
00:04:34.820 325

00:04:35.820 degree
00:04:36.210 oven
00:04:36.240 for
00:04:36.720 about
00:04:37.050 an
00:04:37.320 hour
00:04:37.410 and
00:04:37.740 10

00:04:37.919 minutes
00:04:38.280 or
00:04:38.669 until
00:04:38.880 we
00:04:39.090 reach
00:04:39.240 an
00:04:39.389 internal

00:04:39.690 temperature
00:04:39.780 of
00:04:40.139 about
00:04:40.259 155
00:04:41.190 all
00:04:41.729 right
00:04:41.850 one

00:04:41.970 of
00:04:42.000 the
00:04:42.150 few
00:04:42.360 ways
00:04:42.509 to
00:04:42.539 screw
00:04:42.900 up
00:04:42.990 a
00:04:43.050 meatloaf

00:04:43.320 is
00:04:43.500 to
00:04:43.620 overcook
00:04:44.009 it
00:04:44.220 so
00:04:44.460 check
00:04:44.759 with
00:04:44.789 a

00:04:44.940 thermometer
00:04:45.389 if
00:04:45.479 you
00:04:45.509 can
00:04:45.780 and
00:04:46.139 after
00:04:46.680 about

00:04:46.800 an
00:04:46.919 hour
00:04:47.009 and
00:04:47.220 ten
00:04:47.370 minutes
00:04:47.400 mine
00:04:47.820 look
00:04:48.090 like

00:04:48.240 this
00:04:48.570 but
00:04:49.199 anyway
00:04:49.440 once
00:04:49.650 you
00:04:49.680 pull
00:04:49.889 your

00:04:50.039 meatloaf
00:04:50.340 out
00:04:50.520 you
00:04:51.300 should
00:04:51.449 probably
00:04:51.660 let
00:04:51.840 it

00:04:51.960 sit
00:04:52.139 there
00:04:52.259 at
00:04:52.380 least
00:04:52.470 10
00:04:52.740 minutes
00:04:53.009 before
00:04:53.130 you

00:04:53.310 slice
00:04:53.639 into
00:04:53.880 it
00:04:54.030 and
00:04:54.419 if
00:04:54.990 you
00:04:55.080 don't
00:04:55.229 I'm
00:04:55.410 gonna

00:04:55.530 hear
00:04:55.710 about
00:04:55.740 it
00:04:56.039 Oh
00:04:56.160 someone
00:04:56.759 will
00:04:56.820 drop
00:04:56.970 a

00:04:57.060 dime
00:04:57.240 on
00:04:57.419 you
00:04:57.449 so
00:04:58.110 let
00:04:58.289 it
00:04:58.380 rest
00:04:58.530 a
00:04:58.650 little
00:04:58.740 bit

00:04:59.220 and
00:04:59.340 then
00:04:59.699 we're
00:04:59.789 going
00:04:59.880 to
00:04:59.940 go
00:05:00.030 ahead
00:05:00.120 and

00:05:00.360 slice
00:05:00.600 in
00:05:00.870 and
00:05:01.350 start
00:05:01.560 to
00:05:01.650 analyze
00:05:01.979 this

00:05:02.160 alternative
00:05:02.880 and
00:05:03.060 I
00:05:03.120 think
00:05:03.360 fascinating

00:05:04.080 version
00:05:04.410 of
00:05:04.500 meatloaf
00:05:04.650 now
00:05:05.430 normally
00:05:05.789 I
00:05:05.820 would

00:05:05.880 slice
00:05:06.180 this
00:05:06.330 with
00:05:06.510 my
00:05:06.630 Shiv
00:05:06.900 but
00:05:07.440 it
00:05:07.530 was
00:05:07.650 in

00:05:07.770 the
00:05:07.830 dishwasher
00:05:08.370 so
00:05:08.550 I'm
00:05:08.880 just
00:05:09.030 going
00:05:09.150 to
00:05:09.180 use

00:05:09.300 a
00:05:09.330 regular
00:05:09.479 knife
00:05:09.660 and
00:05:10.229 other
00:05:11.130 than
00:05:11.370 the
00:05:11.460 fact

00:05:11.639 I
00:05:11.789 didn't
00:05:12.000 like
00:05:12.090 the
00:05:12.210 balsamic
00:05:12.360 vinegar
00:05:12.870 and

00:05:12.960 the
00:05:13.050 sauce
00:05:13.229 I
00:05:13.380 used
00:05:13.620 this
00:05:14.160 was
00:05:14.340 absolutely

00:05:14.880 delicious
00:05:15.449 and
00:05:15.690 very
00:05:16.500 very
00:05:16.919 meatball
00:05:17.370 like

00:05:17.400 and
00:05:17.960 in
00:05:18.960 addition
00:05:19.380 to
00:05:19.500 the
00:05:19.590 extreme

00:05:20.039 tenderness
00:05:20.660 it's
00:05:21.660 also
00:05:21.870 going
00:05:22.080 to
00:05:22.169 remain

00:05:22.380 incredibly
00:05:22.740 juicy
00:05:23.310 I
00:05:23.699 mean
00:05:24.360 look
00:05:24.479 at
00:05:24.570 that
00:05:24.630 I

00:05:24.990 mean
00:05:25.710 is
00:05:25.830 that
00:05:25.949 not
00:05:26.099 the
00:05:26.130 juiciest
00:05:26.699 meatloaf

00:05:27.030 you've
00:05:27.210 ever
00:05:27.330 seen
00:05:27.949 so
00:05:28.949 anyway
00:05:29.160 let's
00:05:29.340 go

00:05:29.460 ahead
00:05:29.490 and
00:05:29.699 cut
00:05:29.820 a
00:05:29.849 proper
00:05:30.210 slice
00:05:30.680 even
00:05:31.680 though

00:05:31.770 the
00:05:31.860 flavors
00:05:32.160 were
00:05:32.280 kind
00:05:32.460 of
00:05:32.520 an
00:05:32.610 Italian

00:05:33.060 meatball
00:05:33.389 theme
00:05:33.660 I
00:05:33.690 still
00:05:34.110 went
00:05:34.260 with
00:05:34.410 some

00:05:34.530 mashed
00:05:34.680 potatoes
00:05:34.800 and
00:05:35.490 I
00:05:36.090 also
00:05:36.210 served
00:05:36.539 it

00:05:36.660 with
00:05:36.750 a
00:05:36.810 little
00:05:37.050 bit
00:05:37.139 of
00:05:37.169 arugula
00:05:37.560 but
00:05:38.130 I

00:05:38.160 really
00:05:38.400 think
00:05:38.490 any
00:05:38.699 kind
00:05:38.880 of
00:05:38.940 tossed
00:05:39.150 salad

00:05:39.479 would
00:05:39.630 work
00:05:39.810 here
00:05:40.050 and
00:05:40.919 even
00:05:41.099 though
00:05:41.220 I
00:05:41.250 wasn't

00:05:41.610 crazy
00:05:41.729 about
00:05:41.910 my
00:05:42.090 particular
00:05:42.389 sauce
00:05:42.810 I

00:05:43.199 decided
00:05:43.770 to
00:05:43.860 go
00:05:43.919 ahead
00:05:44.099 and
00:05:44.190 garnish
00:05:44.280 with
00:05:44.460 it

00:05:44.669 anyway
00:05:44.970 you
00:05:45.240 know
00:05:45.690 for
00:05:45.870 the
00:05:45.930 sake
00:05:46.110 of
00:05:46.139 the

00:05:46.289 pictures
00:05:46.620 but
00:05:47.370 anyway
00:05:47.610 that's
00:05:47.760 it
00:05:48.000 what
00:05:48.330 I'm

00:05:48.419 calling
00:05:48.659 prison
00:05:49.110 style
00:05:49.320 meatloaf
00:05:49.830 like
00:05:50.460 I

00:05:50.550 said
00:05:50.729 every
00:05:50.970 once
00:05:51.150 in
00:05:51.210 a
00:05:51.300 while
00:05:51.479 I
00:05:51.510 do
00:05:51.720 like
00:05:51.960 to

00:05:52.080 use
00:05:52.110 this
00:05:52.349 method
00:05:52.770 if
00:05:53.070 made
00:05:53.729 properly
00:05:54.180 my

00:05:54.360 meatloaf
00:05:54.599 should
00:05:54.960 bring
00:05:55.110 all
00:05:55.199 the
00:05:55.320 boys
00:05:55.470 from

00:05:55.710 the
00:05:55.830 yard
00:05:56.039 and
00:05:56.310 they'll
00:05:56.520 be
00:05:56.699 like
00:05:56.849 it's
00:05:57.449 better

00:05:57.659 than
00:05:57.810 mine
00:05:57.990 and
00:05:58.229 if
00:05:58.800 you
00:05:58.889 do
00:05:59.010 give
00:05:59.220 it
00:05:59.310 a
00:05:59.370 go
00:05:59.520 I

00:05:59.550 think
00:05:59.849 you'll
00:05:59.970 find
00:06:00.090 it
00:06:00.270 guilty
00:06:00.630 of
00:06:00.780 being

00:06:00.990 fantastic
00:06:01.289 so
00:06:02.159 I
00:06:02.190 really
00:06:02.490 do
00:06:02.610 hope
00:06:02.729 you
00:06:02.880 give

00:06:03.000 it
00:06:03.090 a
00:06:03.150 try
00:06:03.330 and
00:06:03.780 hope
00:06:04.169 you
00:06:04.289 continue
00:06:04.500 to
00:06:04.770 enjoy

00:06:04.860 it
00:06:05.220 for
00:06:05.400 at
00:06:05.460 least
00:06:05.490 25
00:06:06.060 years
00:06:06.090 to
00:06:06.449 life
00:06:06.479 so
00:06:07.289 head

00:06:07.470 over
