00:06:02.690 that
00:06:02.810 dry
00:06:03.080 that's
00:06:03.410 means
00:06:03.680 your

00:06:04.160 walk
00:06:04.400 is
00:06:04.610 not
00:06:04.790 high
00:06:04.970 not
00:06:05.150 because
00:06:05.600 you
00:06:05.720 need
00:06:05.840 to

00:06:06.020 sear

00:06:07.990 stir-fry
00:06:08.990 and
00:06:09.260 Sears

00:06:09.920 this
00:06:10.100 is
00:06:10.250 good
00:06:11.890 now

00:06:12.890 we're
00:06:13.040 gonna
00:06:13.160 add
00:06:13.310 the
00:06:13.430 sauce
00:06:15.010 the
00:06:16.010 sauce
00:06:16.280 you

00:06:16.580 add
00:06:16.790 as
00:06:17.000 much
00:06:17.210 as
00:06:17.270 you
00:06:17.510 want
00:06:17.840 and
00:06:19.450 depends

00:06:21.230 I
00:06:21.500 usually
00:06:21.830 just
00:06:22.130 think

00:06:22.550 about
00:06:22.670 cover
00:06:23.240 up
00:06:23.510 like
00:06:24.290 a
00:06:24.320 dressing
00:06:25.840 the
00:06:26.840 ideal

00:06:27.110 actually
00:06:27.410 needs
00:06:27.560 to
00:06:27.650 hold
00:06:27.890 entire
00:06:28.160 sauce
00:06:28.480 and

00:06:29.480 then

00:06:32.630 the
00:06:32.870 city
00:06:33.170 I
00:06:33.470 think
00:06:34.070 this
00:06:34.370 is

00:06:34.520 good
00:06:34.700 now
00:06:34.910 and
00:06:35.890 the
00:06:36.890 leftover
00:06:37.370 sauce
00:06:37.550 you
00:06:37.700 can

00:06:37.760 use
00:06:37.880 it
00:06:38.120 for
00:06:38.210 later
00:06:38.560 so
00:06:39.560 now
00:06:41.440 it's
00:06:42.440 very

00:06:42.650 critical
00:06:42.950 a

00:06:44.720 surf
00:06:44.990 like

00:06:45.230 this
00:06:45.470 so
00:06:46.190 the
00:06:46.340 sauce
00:06:46.580 tastes
00:06:47.030 like
00:06:47.240 dressing

00:06:47.780 sweet
00:06:48.470 and
00:06:48.650 sour
00:06:48.920 watery

00:06:53.630 caramelize
00:06:54.190 the
00:06:55.190 sauce

00:06:56.000 have

00:06:56.150 sugar
00:06:56.420 and
