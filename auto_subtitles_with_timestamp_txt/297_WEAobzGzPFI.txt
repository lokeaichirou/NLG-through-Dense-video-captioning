00:02:08.360 nice
00:02:08.660 tender
00:02:09.050 we
00:02:09.229 don't
00:02:09.349 want
00:02:09.470 to

00:02:09.530 cook
00:02:09.649 it
00:02:09.800 too
00:02:09.830 much
00:02:10.450 my
00:02:11.450 vegetables
00:02:12.019 are

00:02:12.230 perfectly
00:02:12.920 cooked
00:02:14.290 now
00:02:15.290 it's
00:02:15.650 time
00:02:15.830 to
00:02:15.860 add

00:02:16.160 the
00:02:16.400 miso
00:02:18.250 when
00:02:19.250 you're
00:02:19.370 adding
00:02:19.550 miso
00:02:20.030 to
00:02:20.090 hot

00:02:20.780 liquids
00:02:21.200 you
00:02:21.260 want
00:02:21.470 to
00:02:21.530 make
00:02:21.650 sure
00:02:21.680 that

00:02:21.920 they're
00:02:22.100 not
00:02:22.340 boiling
00:02:23.239 so
00:02:23.540 I'm
00:02:23.600 taking
00:02:23.720 two

00:02:24.019 tablespoons
00:02:24.590 of
00:02:24.739 miso
00:02:25.390 two
00:02:26.390 tablespoons
00:02:26.989 of

00:02:27.170 water
00:02:27.230 and
00:02:28.209 just
00:02:29.209 whisking
00:02:29.720 and
00:02:29.900 whisk
00:02:30.110 it

00:02:30.290 until
00:02:30.470 it
00:02:30.769 becomes
00:02:31.569 softened
00:02:32.569 this
00:02:33.110 also

00:02:33.350 helps
00:02:33.769 incorporate
00:02:34.280 it
00:02:34.400 into
00:02:34.519 your
00:02:34.610 dish
00:02:34.850 a

00:02:34.880 lot
00:02:35.060 faster
00:02:35.510 so
00:02:36.290 miso
00:02:36.620 is
00:02:36.769 a
00:02:36.799 fermented

00:02:37.250 product
00:02:37.670 and
00:02:37.819 that
00:02:37.880 means
00:02:38.090 there's
00:02:38.299 lots
00:02:38.569 of

00:02:38.720 beneficial
00:02:39.260 microorganisms
00:02:39.640 and
00:02:40.640 you
00:02:40.700 don't

00:02:40.910 want
00:02:41.120 to
00:02:41.380 blast
00:02:42.380 them
00:02:42.709 with
00:02:42.920 lots
00:02:43.220 of
00:02:43.370 high

00:02:43.519 heat
00:02:43.819 and
00:02:44.060 that's
00:02:44.870 why
00:02:45.049 we're
00:02:45.260 tempering
00:02:45.709 it

00:02:45.799 into
00:02:46.069 our
00:02:46.190 soup
00:02:46.489 after
00:02:47.450 it's
00:02:47.599 simmered
00:02:47.959 and

00:02:48.140 one
00:02:48.950 of
00:02:49.040 the
00:02:49.099 reasons
00:02:49.400 I
00:02:49.549 love
00:02:50.090 using
00:02:50.480 miso
00:02:50.930 not

00:02:51.140 just
00:02:51.349 a
00:02:51.440 soup
00:02:51.650 but
