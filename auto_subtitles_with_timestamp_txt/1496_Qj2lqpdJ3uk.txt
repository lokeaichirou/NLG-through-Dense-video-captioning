00:01:28.560 little

00:01:28.920 lumps
00:01:29.159 clinging

00:01:29.850 the
00:01:29.970 bottom
00:01:30.299 here
00:01:32.780 so
00:01:33.780 I

00:01:34.049 can
00:01:34.290 pour
00:01:34.500 that
00:01:34.530 straight
00:01:34.920 in
00:01:36.560 I'm
00:01:37.560 just
00:01:37.619 going

00:01:37.860 to
00:01:37.920 mix
00:01:38.100 up
00:01:38.250 the
00:01:38.400 salt
00:01:38.670 a
00:01:38.790 little
00:01:38.880 bit
00:01:39.119 first

00:01:40.250 then
00:01:41.250 I

00:01:45.600 200
00:01:46.439 mil
00:01:46.860 of
00:01:47.450 the
00:01:48.450 beer
00:01:48.979 beer

00:01:49.979 gives
00:01:50.250 it
00:01:50.369 a
00:01:50.460 really
00:01:50.850 nice
00:01:51.000 flavor
00:01:51.479 and
00:01:51.689 it

00:01:51.899 also
00:01:52.079 helps
00:01:52.619 activate
00:01:53.100 the
00:01:53.250 yeast
00:01:53.399 quite
00:01:53.850 well

00:01:54.060 so
00:01:54.930 just
00:01:54.960 make
00:01:55.290 sure
00:01:55.320 I've
00:01:55.530 got
00:01:55.560 enough
00:01:55.920 in

00:01:56.100 there
00:01:58.490 so
00:01:59.490 all
00:01:59.520 the
00:01:59.670 liquid
00:02:00.119 into
00:02:00.390 place
00:02:00.630 and

00:02:00.960 then
00:02:01.110 using
00:02:01.619 a
00:02:01.710 dough
00:02:02.159 scraper
00:02:02.579 or
00:02:03.060 your
00:02:03.509 hands

00:02:03.750 if
00:02:03.960 you
00:02:04.049 don't
00:02:04.079 have
00:02:04.380 a
00:02:04.409 dough
00:02:04.590 scraper
00:02:04.920 just

00:02:05.820 mix
00:02:06.060 the
00:02:06.299 dough
00:02:06.479 together

00:02:09.319 if
00:02:09.829 you
00:02:10.069 feel
00:02:10.310 it's
00:02:10.519 a
00:02:10.610 little
00:02:10.879 bit
00:02:11.030 dry
00:02:11.269 you

00:02:12.019 can
00:02:12.049 always
00:02:12.560 add
00:02:12.739 a
00:02:12.769 little
00:02:12.890 bit
00:02:13.219 more
00:02:13.250 of

00:02:13.609 either
00:02:13.879 water
00:02:14.209 or
00:02:14.450 beer
00:02:15.260 and
00:02:19.569 all
00:02:20.569 the
00:02:20.719 alcohol

00:02:21.200 in
00:02:21.230 the
00:02:21.379 beer
00:02:21.620 is
00:02:21.829 cooked
00:02:22.129 out
00:02:22.310 so
00:02:22.579 don't
00:02:22.700 worry

00:02:22.819 about
00:02:23.180 giving
00:02:23.329 it
00:02:23.599 to
00:02:24.439 your
00:02:24.590 children
00:02:25.480 right

00:02:26.480 so
00:02:26.720 now
00:02:26.840 I'm
00:02:26.900 going
00:02:27.049 to
00:02:27.109 get
00:02:27.290 my
00:02:27.530 hand
00:02:27.799 in
00:02:28.010 there

00:02:28.040 just
00:02:28.819 one
00:02:29.000 hand
00:02:29.299 at
00:02:29.540 the
00:02:29.629 moment
00:02:29.959 so
00:02:30.140 you
00:02:30.200 don't

00:02:30.470 get
00:02:30.590 covered
00:02:31.069 in
00:02:31.189 dough
00:02:34.840 and
00:02:35.840 now
00:02:35.989 I'm
00:02:36.109 going

00:02:36.319 to
00:02:36.409 need
00:02:36.650 it

00:02:38.379 so
00:02:39.379 you
00:02:39.439 can
00:02:39.680 see
00:02:39.920 that
00:02:40.129 it
00:02:40.250 doesn't
00:02:40.459 have
00:02:40.730 much

00:02:40.939 elasticity
00:02:41.480 at
00:02:41.900 the
00:02:41.930 moment
00:02:42.319 but
00:02:42.530 you're

00:02:42.650 going
00:02:42.769 to
00:02:42.829 develop
00:02:43.129 that
00:02:43.340 by
00:02:43.760 the
00:02:43.819 kneading
00:02:44.920 so

00:02:45.920 what
00:02:46.069 I'm
00:02:46.189 going
00:02:46.340 to
00:02:46.370 do
00:02:46.609 is
00:02:48.819 stretch
00:02:49.819 out
00:02:50.120 the

00:02:50.329 dough
00:02:50.530 fold
00:02:51.530 it
00:02:51.859 to
00:02:52.069 trap
00:02:52.310 the
00:02:52.489 air
00:02:52.639 in
00:02:52.849 there

00:02:53.090 and
00:02:53.329 turn
00:02:53.989 it
00:02:54.019 right
00:02:54.980 so
00:02:55.250 once
00:02:55.459 it
00:02:55.700 springs

00:02:56.510 back
00:02:56.810 to
00:02:57.049 the
00:02:57.139 touch
00:02:57.409 let's
00:02:58.010 have
00:02:58.220 a
00:02:58.250 look

00:02:58.510 there
00:02:59.510 we
00:02:59.599 are
00:02:59.629 you
00:02:59.959 think
00:03:00.260 it's
00:03:00.409 springing

00:03:01.129 back
00:03:01.159 to
00:03:01.400 the
00:03:01.489 touch
00:03:01.730 so
00:03:02.000 I
00:03:02.389 know
00:03:02.629 that
00:03:02.930 I've

00:03:03.049 needed
00:03:03.319 it
00:03:03.650 enough
00:03:04.579 so
00:03:04.909 it's
00:03:05.030 probably
00:03:05.299 been

00:03:05.510 around
00:03:05.629 seven
00:03:06.260 to
00:03:06.439 ten
00:03:06.680 minutes
00:03:07.359 but
00:03:08.359 that's

00:03:08.480 really
00:03:08.900 going
00:03:09.859 for
00:03:10.099 it
00:03:10.220 so
00:03:10.639 I've
00:03:10.760 got
00:03:10.939 my

00:03:11.060 lovely
00:03:11.599 soft
00:03:12.290 ball
00:03:12.560 of
00:03:12.739 dough
00:03:12.919 I'm
00:03:13.159 now
00:03:13.579 going

00:03:13.729 to
00:03:13.849 cut
00:03:14.030 it
00:03:14.209 into
00:03:14.389 four
