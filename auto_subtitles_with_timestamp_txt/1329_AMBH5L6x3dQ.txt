00:01:47.189 teaspoon

00:01:48.450 the
00:01:48.570 whole
00:01:48.780 block
00:01:49.170 now
00:01:49.770 this
00:01:50.070 if

00:01:50.340 you
00:01:50.549 want
00:01:51.090 to
00:01:51.299 you
00:01:51.450 can
00:01:51.600 actually
00:01:51.810 toast
00:01:52.409 them

00:01:52.649 fairly
00:01:52.950 gently
00:01:53.549 on
00:01:54.240 the
00:01:54.299 flame
00:01:54.720 so
00:01:54.930 that
00:01:54.960 gives

00:01:55.350 it
00:01:55.500 that
00:01:55.530 extra
00:01:55.829 sort
00:01:56.490 of
00:01:56.549 toastiness
00:01:57.210 but
00:01:57.899 you

00:01:57.990 don't
00:01:58.170 have
00:01:58.409 to
00:01:58.619 we've
00:01:59.219 also
00:01:59.430 got
00:01:59.729 some

00:01:59.759 coriander

00:02:01.200 a
00:02:01.229 teaspoon
00:02:01.530 we're

00:02:01.950 going
00:02:02.100 to
00:02:02.159 add
00:02:02.310 in
00:02:02.520 I
00:02:03.200 think
00:02:04.200 that's
00:02:04.380 all
00:02:04.530 so

00:02:04.770 we're
00:02:04.950 going
00:02:05.070 to
00:02:05.219 put
00:02:05.369 a
00:02:05.399 little
00:02:05.640 bit
00:02:05.759 of
00:02:05.880 oil

00:02:06.060 to
00:02:06.180 lubricate
00:02:06.420 it
00:02:06.780 and
00:02:06.990 then
00:02:07.079 we're
00:02:07.200 going
00:02:07.320 to

00:02:07.409 grind
00:02:07.590 it
00:02:07.770 all
00:02:07.890 together
00:02:08.069 and
00:02:08.429 that's
00:02:08.879 going

00:02:09.149 to
00:02:09.270 be
00:02:09.360 our
00:02:09.450 pace

00:02:10.060 we
00:02:10.239 can
00:02:10.390 start
00:02:10.599 making
00:02:10.690 the
00:02:10.959 Lancer
00:02:11.349 so
00:02:11.920 just

00:02:12.130 about
00:02:12.280 a
00:02:12.340 tablespoon
00:02:17.130 now
00:02:18.130 I'm
00:02:18.849 going
00:02:19.000 to

00:02:19.060 start
00:02:19.270 whizzing
00:02:24.630 now
00:02:25.630 we're
00:02:25.840 just
00:02:25.959 going
00:02:26.110 to

00:02:26.200 tip
00:02:26.470 this
00:02:26.650 prawn
00:02:27.069 heads
00:02:27.099 in
00:02:27.790 there
00:02:33.480 so
00:02:34.480 it

00:02:34.569 smells
00:02:34.870 nice
00:02:35.140 instead
00:02:35.560 of
00:02:35.680 pointing
00:02:35.920 now
00:02:36.040 you

00:02:36.099 can
00:02:36.280 see
00:02:36.489 it
00:02:36.610 slowly
00:02:37.060 changes
00:02:37.660 color
00:02:37.959 to
00:02:38.260 this

00:02:38.560 nice
00:02:38.890 sort
00:02:39.160 of
00:02:39.220 orangey
00:02:39.459 sort
00:02:39.940 of

00:02:40.620 sort

00:02:41.620 of
00:02:41.709 prawn
00:02:42.069 oil
00:02:42.370 and
00:02:43.090 that's
00:02:43.360 what
00:02:43.569 you
00:02:43.720 want
00:02:43.959 so

00:02:44.110 there'll
00:02:44.290 be
00:02:44.319 a
00:02:44.440 lot
00:02:44.590 of
00:02:44.620 splattering

00:04:23.570 balls
00:04:23.840 the
00:04:24.290 tofu
00:04:24.650 paths
00:04:24.920 but
00:04:25.520 now
00:04:25.730 is

00:04:26.030 when
00:04:26.270 the
00:04:26.420 balancing
00:04:26.900 sort
00:04:27.140 of
00:04:27.200 starts
00:04:27.530 so
00:04:27.710 you

00:04:28.250 want
00:04:28.430 to
00:04:28.520 taste
00:04:28.760 it
00:04:28.940 now
00:04:29.120 if
00:04:29.210 you
00:04:29.300 taste
00:04:29.570 it

00:04:29.690 right
00:04:29.810 now
00:04:30.020 it's
00:04:30.200 going
00:04:30.410 to
00:04:30.470 be
00:04:30.560 fairly
00:04:31.360 it's

00:04:32.360 going
00:04:32.600 to
00:04:32.660 be
00:04:32.720 fairly
00:04:32.840 creamy
00:04:33.410 and
00:04:33.710 it's
00:04:33.980 going

00:04:34.130 to
00:04:34.190 be
00:04:34.280 fairly
00:04:34.460 you
00:04:34.760 know
00:04:34.790 kind
00:04:35.090 of
00:04:35.680 raw
00:04:36.680 so

00:04:37.070 it's
00:04:37.190 not
00:04:37.280 ready
00:04:37.520 yet
00:04:37.610 so
00:04:37.940 this
00:04:38.090 is
00:04:38.240 when
00:04:38.420 you

00:04:38.510 start
00:04:38.570 adding
00:04:38.990 little
00:04:39.350 bits
00:04:39.530 and
00:04:39.620 pieces
00:04:39.680 so

00:04:40.010 you
00:04:40.100 add
00:04:40.280 by
00:04:40.520 splashing
00:04:41.180 a
00:04:41.300 couple
00:04:41.600 of
00:04:41.690 drops

00:04:41.930 of
00:04:42.190 fish
00:04:43.190 sauce
00:04:44.230 when
00:04:45.230 a
00:04:45.260 couple
00:04:45.770 I
00:04:45.920 mean
00:04:46.100 you

00:04:46.340 know
00:04:47.050 about
00:04:48.050 a
00:04:48.110 minute

00:04:48.770 of
00:04:49.730 splashing
00:04:50.390 so
00:04:50.990 we
00:04:51.080 can
00:04:51.200 add
00:04:51.350 a
00:04:51.380 bit
00:04:51.530 of

00:04:51.590 sugar
00:04:51.830 to
00:04:52.160 flavor
00:04:52.580 that
00:04:53.950 and
00:04:54.950 then
00:04:55.160 we're

00:04:55.340 going
00:04:55.520 to
00:04:55.580 squeeze
00:04:55.970 some
00:04:56.030 lime
00:04:56.419 juice
00:04:56.480 in
00:04:57.220 just

00:04:58.220 be
00:04:58.340 sitting
00:04:58.669 there

00:05:00.730 so
00:05:01.480 the
00:05:01.630 idea
00:05:01.990 is
00:05:02.170 you
00:05:02.350 want
00:05:03.330 to
00:05:04.330 find
00:05:04.600 a

00:05:04.750 balance
00:05:05.140 so
00:05:05.680 when
00:05:05.830 you're
00:05:05.980 actually

00:05:06.100 flavoring
00:05:06.850 you
00:05:06.970 kind
00:05:07.240 of
00:05:07.300 need
00:05:07.450 to
00:05:07.480 sort
00:05:07.720 of
00:05:07.780 go

00:05:07.870 okay
00:05:08.260 that
00:05:08.820 needs
00:05:09.820 a
00:05:09.970 bit
00:05:10.150 more
00:05:10.180 fish
00:05:10.600 sauce
00:05:10.630 so

00:05:10.990 that
00:05:11.020 needs
00:05:11.290 a
00:05:11.380 bit
00:05:11.470 more
00:05:11.530 salt
00:05:11.680 now
00:05:12.610 then

00:05:12.850 we're
00:05:13.030 going
00:05:13.210 to
00:05:13.270 add
00:05:13.450 the
00:05:13.660 prawns
00:05:13.960 in
00:05:15.720 righto

00:05:16.720 so
00:05:17.170 once
00:05:17.530 that's
00:05:17.770 in
00:05:17.980 we're
00:05:18.160 going
00:05:18.280 to
00:05:18.340 add
00:05:18.460 the

00:05:18.700 balls
00:05:18.940 fish
00:05:19.840 balls
00:05:20.170 and
00:05:20.520 the
00:05:21.520 tofu
00:05:21.880 puffs
00:05:22.090 as

00:05:22.270 well
00:05:23.490 so
00:05:24.490 we're
00:05:24.790 ready
00:05:24.940 to
00:05:25.060 play
00:05:25.360 it
00:05:25.480 up
00:05:25.600 that's

00:05:25.900 sort
00:05:26.230 of
00:05:26.290 nice
00:05:26.500 and
00:05:26.770 percolating
00:05:27.100 away
00:05:27.550 so

00:05:27.610 we've
00:05:27.910 got
00:05:28.150 our
00:05:28.330 lovely
