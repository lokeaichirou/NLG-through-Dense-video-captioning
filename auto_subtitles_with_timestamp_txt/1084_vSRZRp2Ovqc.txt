00:00:00.199 hello
00:00:01.199 this
00:00:01.380 is
00:00:01.439 chef
00:00:01.589 john
00:00:01.920 from
00:00:01.949 food
00:00:02.340 wishes

00:00:02.639 comm
00:00:03.090 with
00:00:03.449 spaghetti
00:00:04.350 carbonara
00:00:04.700 which
00:00:05.700 is
00:00:05.910 I

00:00:06.150 think
00:00:06.420 gonna
00:00:07.109 be
00:00:07.200 a
00:00:07.319 lot
00:00:07.500 different
00:00:07.649 than
00:00:07.980 you

00:00:08.189 imagine
00:00:08.849 first
00:00:09.360 of
00:00:09.450 all
00:00:09.480 there's
00:00:09.660 no
00:00:09.750 cream
00:00:10.019 in

00:00:10.050 it
00:00:10.260 I
00:00:10.440 think
00:00:10.889 that's
00:00:10.980 a
00:00:11.190 later
00:00:11.759 day
00:00:12.059 invention

00:00:12.690 but
00:00:13.320 really
00:00:13.710 this
00:00:13.980 could
00:00:14.160 be
00:00:14.280 called

00:00:14.519 spaghetti
00:00:14.940 with
00:00:15.210 bacon
00:00:15.630 and
00:00:15.750 egg
00:00:15.870 sauce

00:00:16.139 because
00:00:16.470 that's
00:00:16.650 basically
00:00:17.369 what
00:00:17.609 it
00:00:17.699 is
00:00:17.730 so

00:00:18.449 I'm
00:00:18.539 going
00:00:18.660 to
00:00:18.720 slowly
00:00:19.020 cook
00:00:19.470 some
00:00:19.710 bacon
00:00:20.130 in
00:00:20.430 a

00:00:20.460 little
00:00:20.880 bit
00:00:21.000 of
00:00:21.090 olive
00:00:21.210 oil
00:00:21.420 on
00:00:21.720 medium-low

00:00:22.800 traditionally
00:00:23.340 which
00:00:23.519 uses
00:00:23.910 somebody
00:00:24.180 called

00:00:24.390 guanciale
00:00:24.930 which
00:00:25.260 is
00:00:25.859 a
00:00:25.890 cured
00:00:26.789 pork
00:00:27.210 cheek

00:00:27.599 bacon
00:00:28.260 type
00:00:28.500 product
00:00:29.310 or
00:00:29.580 you
00:00:29.820 can
00:00:29.939 use

00:00:30.750 those
00:00:31.050 aren't
00:00:31.260 smoked
00:00:31.710 I
00:00:31.949 actually
00:00:32.250 prefer

00:00:32.759 the
00:00:32.790 unsmoked
00:00:33.360 flavor
00:00:33.690 of
00:00:33.840 the
00:00:33.930 pancetta
00:00:34.290 so

00:00:34.770 if
00:00:34.860 you
00:00:34.950 can
00:00:35.070 find
00:00:35.250 pancetta
00:00:35.880 or
00:00:36.149 guanciale

00:00:36.930 use
00:00:37.649 that
00:00:37.890 alright
00:00:38.309 so
00:00:38.399 we're
00:00:38.520 gonna
00:00:38.579 cook

00:00:38.790 that
00:00:38.850 until
00:00:39.149 not
00:00:39.660 quite
00:00:40.350 crisp
00:00:40.829 we
00:00:41.280 want
00:00:41.460 it

00:00:41.550 cooked
00:00:41.790 but
00:00:42.239 not
00:00:42.390 browned
00:00:42.840 and
00:00:43.020 crispy
00:00:43.410 we're

00:00:43.829 also
00:00:43.950 going
00:00:44.129 to
00:00:44.190 add
00:00:44.370 a
00:00:44.670 healthy
00:00:45.270 dose
00:00:45.539 of

00:00:45.780 black
00:00:46.050 pepper
00:00:46.320 by
00:00:46.829 the
00:00:46.890 way
00:00:47.039 that's
00:00:47.280 where
00:00:47.460 the

00:00:47.489 name
00:00:47.550 comes
00:00:47.879 from
00:00:48.030 you
00:00:48.660 can
00:00:48.780 read
00:00:48.930 about
00:00:49.050 that

00:00:49.200 in
00:00:49.260 the
00:00:49.350 post
00:00:49.620 all
00:00:50.070 right
00:00:50.219 so
00:00:50.340 while
00:00:50.460 the

00:00:50.579 Bacon's
00:00:50.940 cooking
00:00:51.329 I'm
00:00:51.510 going
00:00:51.600 to
00:00:51.690 take
00:00:51.899 two

00:00:52.170 eggs
00:00:52.379 some
00:00:53.340 more
00:00:53.489 black
00:00:53.670 pepper

00:00:54.030 did
00:00:54.780 I
00:00:54.809 mention
00:00:54.989 that's
00:00:55.260 an
00:00:55.350 important

00:00:55.649 ingredient
00:00:55.800 some
00:00:56.340 fresh
00:00:56.730 Parmesan
00:00:57.719 or

00:00:58.020 pecorino
00:00:58.789 romano
00:00:59.789 cheese
00:01:00.180 or
00:01:00.690 a
00:01:00.750 combination

00:01:01.590 of
00:01:01.680 both

00:01:02.129 I
00:01:02.160 think
00:01:02.820 5050
00:01:03.420 is
00:01:03.600 perfect
00:01:04.220 so
00:01:05.220 we're
00:01:05.309 going

00:01:05.400 to
00:01:05.460 put
00:01:05.580 our
00:01:05.670 grated
00:01:06.060 cheese
00:01:06.210 in
00:01:06.390 there
00:01:06.619 whisk

00:01:07.619 that
00:01:07.770 up
00:01:07.830 and
00:01:08.220 set
00:01:08.430 that
00:01:08.520 aside
00:01:09.080 alright
00:01:10.080 our

00:01:10.170 bacon
00:01:10.500 is
00:01:10.619 cooked
00:01:10.920 or
00:01:11.159 hopefully
00:01:12.090 in
00:01:12.150 your

00:01:12.210 case
00:01:12.479 guanciale
00:01:13.170 or
00:01:13.610 pancetta
00:01:14.610 when
00:01:15.299 it
00:01:15.390 looks

00:01:15.570 like
00:01:15.750 that
00:01:15.930 we're
00:01:16.350 going
00:01:16.439 to
00:01:16.500 turn
00:01:16.619 that
00:01:16.680 down

00:01:16.860 to
00:01:17.130 low
00:01:17.340 as
00:01:17.490 it
00:01:17.610 goes
00:01:17.790 and
00:01:18.060 we're
00:01:18.780 going
00:01:18.900 to
00:01:18.930 put

00:01:19.080 on
00:01:19.170 our
00:01:19.200 pasta
00:01:19.680 to
00:01:19.770 boil
00:01:19.979 now
00:01:20.189 the
00:01:20.939 pasta
00:01:21.450 water

00:01:21.659 is
00:01:21.900 an
00:01:22.170 important
00:01:22.740 aspect
00:01:23.100 of
00:01:23.400 this
00:01:23.610 sauce
00:01:23.850 so

00:01:24.240 we're
00:01:24.360 going
00:01:24.450 to
00:01:24.540 use
00:01:24.659 that
00:01:24.869 water
00:01:25.259 as
00:01:25.619 the

00:01:26.130 pasta
00:01:26.460 cooks
00:01:26.729 to
00:01:27.330 finish
00:01:27.630 this
00:01:27.840 sauce
00:01:28.049 so
00:01:28.320 what

00:01:28.560 you
00:01:28.650 want
00:01:28.829 to
00:01:28.950 do
00:01:29.070 and
00:01:29.310 by
00:01:29.460 the
00:01:29.520 way
00:01:29.670 I'm
00:01:29.790 making

00:01:29.909 this
00:01:30.150 for
00:01:30.329 two
00:01:30.479 people
00:01:30.780 so
00:01:31.140 I
00:01:31.170 have
00:01:31.290 about
00:01:31.350 six

00:01:31.710 ounces
00:01:32.040 of
00:01:32.220 raw
00:01:32.430 pasta
00:01:32.880 in
00:01:32.970 there
00:01:33.090 so

00:01:38.400 again

00:01:39.420 low
00:01:39.720 a
00:01:39.750 heat
00:01:40.290 as
00:01:40.409 it

00:01:40.560 goes

00:01:41.490 the
00:01:41.670 pasta
00:01:41.880 is
00:01:42.150 cooked
00:01:42.180 I'm

00:01:46.259 mixture
00:01:47.040 by
00:01:47.640 the
00:01:47.700 way
00:01:47.850 if

00:01:47.939 you're
00:01:48.060 wondering
00:01:48.149 why
00:01:48.450 that
00:01:48.600 looks
00:01:48.750 kind
00:01:49.079 of

00:01:49.110 dark
00:01:49.350 I'm
00:01:49.619 using
00:01:50.009 a
00:01:50.280 whole-grain
00:01:50.579 brilla

00:01:51.720 plus
00:01:52.500 pasta
00:01:52.979 which
00:01:53.189 I
00:01:53.310 love
00:01:53.640 once
00:01:54.390 that's

00:01:54.570 mixed
00:01:54.750 drizzle
00:01:55.380 in
00:01:55.530 your
00:01:55.860 egg
00:01:56.100 cheese
00:01:56.670 mixture

00:01:57.030 so
00:01:57.659 you're
00:01:57.750 going
00:01:57.869 to
00:01:57.930 stir
00:01:58.079 in
00:01:58.200 the
00:01:58.290 egg
00:01:58.469 it's

00:01:59.219 going
00:01:59.430 to
00:01:59.490 hit
00:02:00.060 that
00:02:00.240 hot
00:02:00.630 pasta
00:02:00.990 and
00:02:01.560 it's

00:02:01.890 going
00:02:02.009 to
00:02:02.100 form
00:02:02.399 a
00:02:02.520 really
00:02:02.969 creamy
00:02:03.689 rich
00:02:04.380 but

00:02:05.310 not
00:02:05.630 cream-based
00:02:06.630 sauce
00:02:07.320 alright
00:02:07.950 as
00:02:08.069 soon
00:02:08.250 as

00:02:08.340 that's
00:02:08.489 combined
00:02:08.759 like
00:02:08.940 that
00:02:09.179 turn
00:02:09.539 off
00:02:09.690 the

00:02:09.840 heat
00:02:10.020 throw
00:02:10.619 in
00:02:10.739 your
00:02:10.830 cheese
00:02:11.099 I'm
00:02:11.459 using
00:02:11.670 half

00:02:12.290 pecorino
00:02:13.290 romano

00:02:13.920 half
00:02:14.400 Reggiano
00:02:14.910 parmesan
00:02:15.390 mix
00:02:16.050 it
00:02:16.200 around
00:02:16.290 and

00:02:16.890 you're
00:02:17.520 ready
00:02:17.700 to
00:02:17.790 eat
00:02:18.060 so
00:02:18.540 anyway
00:02:18.780 that's
00:02:18.930 my

00:02:19.080 version
00:02:19.230 of
00:02:19.770 authentic
00:02:20.459 spaghetti
00:02:21.390 carbonara

00:02:22.020 like
00:02:22.170 I
00:02:22.290 said
00:02:22.350 smoked
00:02:23.310 bacon
00:02:23.520 not
00:02:23.910 the
00:02:24.090 best

00:02:24.270 choice
00:02:24.840 it
00:02:24.959 works
00:02:25.230 in
00:02:25.410 a
00:02:25.470 pinch
00:02:25.680 but
00:02:26.220 try
00:02:26.430 to

00:02:26.490 find
00:02:26.730 some
00:02:27.000 pancetta
00:02:27.240 and
00:02:27.810 I
00:02:28.230 think
00:02:28.440 you're

00:02:28.560 going
00:02:28.650 to
00:02:28.740 like
00:02:28.890 this
00:02:29.010 even
00:02:29.370 more
00:02:29.580 without

00:02:29.850 that
00:02:30.209 smoky
00:02:30.630 flavor
00:02:30.660 it
00:02:31.320 can
00:02:31.530 be
00:02:31.620 a
00:02:31.650 little

00:02:32.040 overpowering
00:02:32.610 and
00:02:32.910 if
00:02:33.270 you
00:02:33.360 want
