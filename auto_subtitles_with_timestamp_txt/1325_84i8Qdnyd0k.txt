00:00:02.669 mashed
00:00:02.939 potatoes
00:00:03.540 if

00:00:03.899 you're
00:00:04.529 using
00:00:04.740 the
00:00:05.040 wrong
00:00:05.310 potato

00:00:07.470 in
00:00:07.589 a
00:00:07.649 food
00:00:07.830 processor
00:00:09.200 you're

00:00:10.200 doing
00:00:10.590 it
00:00:10.710 all
00:00:10.920 wrong
00:00:12.769 the
00:00:13.769 first
00:00:13.950 mistake

00:00:14.429 people
00:00:14.460 tend
00:00:14.969 to
00:00:15.120 make
00:00:15.269 is
00:00:15.480 they
00:00:15.599 pick
00:00:15.839 the

00:00:16.049 wrong
00:00:16.199 potato
00:00:16.770 they
00:00:17.310 get
00:00:17.520 waxy
00:00:18.150 or
00:00:18.510 boiling

00:00:18.840 potatoes
00:00:19.170 which
00:00:19.949 are
00:00:20.400 great
00:00:20.820 for
00:00:20.850 boiling
00:00:21.270 but

00:00:21.779 they're
00:00:21.930 not
00:00:21.990 so
00:00:22.230 great
00:00:22.350 for
00:00:22.439 mashing
00:00:23.070 and

00:00:23.519 even
00:00:23.850 if
00:00:23.970 they
00:00:24.119 do
00:00:24.180 buy
00:00:24.510 the
00:00:24.570 right
00:00:24.810 potato
00:00:25.230 a

00:00:25.619 lot
00:00:25.920 of
00:00:26.099 people
00:00:26.400 end
00:00:26.550 up
00:00:26.699 not
00:00:26.910 cooking
00:00:27.330 them

00:00:27.390 long
00:00:27.630 enough
00:00:27.810 they
00:00:28.380 cook
00:00:28.619 their
00:00:28.830 potato
00:00:29.189 only

00:00:29.820 until
00:00:30.179 it's
00:00:30.359 just
00:00:30.449 done
00:00:31.109 the
00:00:31.289 way
00:00:31.410 you
00:00:31.439 would

00:00:31.800 have
00:00:32.099 potatoes
00:00:32.550 with
00:00:32.730 your
00:00:32.850 steak
00:00:33.120 for

00:00:33.360 instance
00:00:33.780 that
00:00:34.380 makes
00:00:34.559 them
00:00:34.739 harder
00:00:35.100 to
00:00:35.190 mash

00:00:35.460 and
00:00:36.120 you
00:00:36.239 end
00:00:36.420 up
00:00:36.600 with
00:00:36.780 little
00:00:37.020 pebbly
00:00:37.559 pieces

00:00:37.980 in
00:00:38.160 your
00:00:38.190 mashed
00:00:38.489 potatoes
00:00:39.030 and
00:00:39.300 who
00:00:39.750 wants

00:00:40.559 another
00:00:41.399 problem
00:00:41.700 people
00:00:42.090 have
00:00:42.270 is
00:00:42.930 that
00:00:42.960 they

00:00:43.320 skimp
00:00:43.829 on
00:00:43.980 the
00:00:44.129 milk
00:00:44.340 and
00:00:44.520 cream
00:00:44.730 so
00:00:45.300 the

00:00:45.660 potatoes
00:00:46.020 end
00:00:46.230 up
00:00:46.350 all
00:00:46.559 stiff
00:00:47.190 this
00:00:47.910 is
00:00:48.120 bad

00:00:48.809 you
00:00:49.559 might
00:00:49.770 think
00:00:50.129 that
00:00:50.190 using
00:00:50.670 a
00:00:50.730 food

00:00:50.940 processor
00:00:51.600 to
00:00:51.629 mash
00:00:51.989 your
00:00:52.199 potatoes
00:00:52.230 would
00:00:53.129 be

00:00:53.280 great
00:00:53.610 because
00:00:53.850 it's
00:00:54.120 really
00:00:54.420 quick
00:00:54.690 this
00:00:55.379 is

00:00:55.649 so
00:00:55.980 wrong
00:00:56.430 it
00:00:57.000 just
00:00:57.210 turns
00:00:57.510 them
00:00:57.780 into
00:00:57.899 this

00:00:58.230 sort
00:00:58.469 of
00:00:58.559 sticky
00:00:59.100 pasty
00:00:59.670 lump
00:01:00.090 of
00:01:00.300 glue
00:01:00.600 it
00:01:01.109 is

00:01:01.440 the
00:01:01.649 worst
00:01:01.980 thing
00:01:02.340 you
00:01:02.550 can
00:01:02.789 do
00:01:03.000 to
00:01:03.149 a
00:01:03.180 potato

00:01:07.790 now
00:01:08.790 I'm
00:01:09.000 going
00:01:09.240 to
00:01:09.360 show
00:01:09.540 you
00:01:09.600 the
00:01:09.930 right
00:01:10.290 way

00:01:10.560 to
00:01:10.590 mashed
00:01:10.979 potatoes
00:01:11.580 the
00:01:12.060 same
00:01:12.330 way
00:01:12.510 my

00:01:12.780 mother
00:01:13.049 showed
00:01:13.350 me
00:01:13.590 the
00:01:14.100 first
00:01:14.340 thing
00:01:14.490 you

00:01:14.610 want
00:01:14.790 to
00:01:14.909 do
00:01:15.090 is
00:01:15.360 pick
00:01:15.659 a
00:01:15.689 starchy
00:01:16.259 potato

00:01:16.590 because
00:01:16.830 it'll
00:01:17.189 fall
00:01:17.460 apart
00:01:17.820 that's
00:01:18.119 what
00:01:18.299 you

00:01:18.450 want
00:01:18.659 the
00:01:19.200 starches
00:01:19.650 potatoes
00:01:19.710 are
00:01:20.490 russets

00:01:21.119 and
00:01:21.420 the
00:01:21.689 next
00:01:21.900 starchy
00:01:22.170 astir
00:01:22.530 Yukon
00:01:22.890 Golds

00:01:23.400 and
00:01:23.549 both
00:01:23.700 are
00:01:23.909 just
00:01:23.939 fine
00:01:24.270 next
00:01:25.110 you
00:01:25.470 want
00:01:25.650 to

00:01:25.799 peel
00:01:26.100 rinse
00:01:26.759 and
00:01:27.090 most
00:01:27.509 important
00:01:28.140 cut
00:01:28.770 your

00:01:28.950 potatoes
00:01:29.460 into
00:01:29.670 nice
00:01:30.090 even
00:01:31.079 chunks
00:01:31.860 that
00:01:32.670 way

00:01:32.909 they'll
00:01:33.150 all
00:01:33.360 cook
00:01:33.600 at
00:01:33.720 the
00:01:33.869 same
00:01:33.900 rate
00:01:34.140 and

00:01:34.680 you
00:01:35.070 won't
00:01:35.310 get
00:01:35.549 any
00:01:35.700 weird
00:01:36.060 little
00:01:36.299 nasty

00:01:36.780 hard
00:01:37.049 bits
00:01:37.290 in
00:01:37.560 your
00:01:37.680 potato
00:01:38.060 next
00:01:39.060 comes
00:01:39.299 a

00:01:39.450 crucial
00:01:39.990 step
00:01:40.290 you
00:01:40.890 want
00:01:41.100 to
00:01:41.250 cook
00:01:41.549 these

00:01:41.790 potatoes
00:01:41.960 until
00:01:42.960 they
00:01:43.110 are
00:01:43.320 falling
00:01:43.979 apart

00:01:44.100 put
00:01:44.850 them
00:01:45.000 in
00:01:45.119 cold
00:01:45.360 water
00:01:45.750 and
00:01:45.990 bring
00:01:46.049 them
00:01:46.350 to

00:01:46.500 a
00:01:46.530 boil
00:01:46.860 because
00:01:47.310 that
00:01:47.460 starts
00:01:47.790 to
00:01:47.939 break
00:01:48.119 them

00:01:48.329 down
00:01:48.509 more
00:01:48.930 than
00:01:48.990 if
00:01:49.380 you
00:01:49.470 just
00:01:49.740 put
00:01:49.950 them
00:01:50.100 in

00:01:50.159 boiling
00:01:50.579 water
00:01:50.610 you
00:01:51.060 want
00:01:51.570 to
00:01:51.659 salt
00:01:51.899 the
00:01:52.079 water

00:01:52.200 because
00:01:52.590 the
00:01:52.619 salt
00:01:52.770 starts
00:01:53.369 to
00:01:53.520 disintegrate

00:01:53.909 the
00:01:54.180 potatoes
00:01:54.630 too
00:01:54.990 but
00:01:55.439 the
00:01:55.560 most
00:01:55.799 important

00:01:56.399 thing
00:01:56.640 is
00:01:56.880 that
00:01:56.939 you
00:01:57.540 really
00:01:58.140 cook
00:01:58.350 those

00:01:58.530 potatoes
00:01:59.040 about
00:01:59.310 twenty-five
00:01:59.850 minutes
00:02:00.299 after

00:02:00.990 you
00:02:01.079 bring
00:02:01.259 them
00:02:01.350 to
00:02:01.500 a
00:02:01.530 boil
00:02:01.860 let
00:02:02.189 them
00:02:02.579 simmer

00:02:02.939 a
00:02:03.060 long

00:02:03.600 long
00:02:03.689 and
00:02:03.900 slow
00:02:04.200 until
00:02:04.530 the
00:02:05.100 edges
00:02:05.280 start
00:02:05.490 to

00:02:05.909 fall
00:02:06.150 off
00:02:06.390 and
00:02:06.689 when
00:02:06.869 you
00:02:06.900 stick
00:02:07.229 a
00:02:07.290 knife
00:02:07.500 in

00:02:07.710 the
00:02:07.830 middle
00:02:08.009 it
00:02:08.550 just
00:02:08.850 all
00:02:09.030 falls
00:02:09.270 apart
00:02:09.709 drain

00:02:10.709 the
00:02:10.890 potatoes

00:02:12.239 put
00:02:12.600 them
00:02:12.750 right

00:02:13.050 back
00:02:13.110 into
00:02:13.500 that
00:02:13.590 hot
00:02:13.950 pot
00:02:14.280 and
00:02:14.610 start

00:02:16.110 over
00:02:16.590 very
00:02:16.890 low
00:02:17.160 heat
00:02:17.520 until
00:02:17.700 they

00:02:18.239 really
00:02:19.020 start
00:02:19.319 falling
00:02:19.590 apart
00:02:19.830 turning
00:02:20.520 white

00:02:20.730 on
00:02:20.910 the
00:02:21.030 edges
00:02:21.450 and
00:02:21.600 practically
00:02:22.470 turning

00:02:22.890 into
00:02:23.069 mashed
00:02:23.250 potatoes
00:02:23.760 right
00:02:24.060 then

00:02:24.600 in
00:02:24.720 the
00:02:24.810 pot
00:02:25.020 to
00:02:25.680 finish
00:02:26.010 the
00:02:26.220 job
00:02:26.430 you

00:02:26.790 can
00:02:26.940 use
00:02:27.270 a
00:02:27.300 hand
00:02:27.660 masher
00:02:28.170 or
00:02:28.530 you
00:02:28.950 can
00:02:29.130 use
00:02:29.280 a

00:02:37.019 it's
00:02:37.290 warm
00:02:37.620 so
00:02:37.920 it

00:02:38.310 cool
00:02:38.489 down
