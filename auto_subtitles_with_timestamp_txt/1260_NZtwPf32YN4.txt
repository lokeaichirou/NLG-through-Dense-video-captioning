00:00:10.080 perfect

00:00:10.559 accompaniment
00:00:10.950 to
00:00:11.070 my
00:00:11.370 tea
00:00:11.519 smoked
00:00:12.030 salmon
00:00:13.250 to

00:00:14.250 begin
00:00:14.580 take
00:00:15.389 the

00:00:17.000 so
00:00:18.000 I'm

00:00:30.779 and
00:00:31.230 you
00:00:31.380 reduce
00:00:31.740 the
00:00:32.040 chance

00:00:42.570 little
00:00:42.840 bit
00:00:42.960 of
00:00:43.079 richness

00:00:43.230 without
00:00:43.710 making

00:00:44.129 too
00:00:44.250 creamy

00:00:57.820 light
00:00:58.820 whisk

00:00:59.270 I
00:00:59.450 don't
00:01:00.050 know
00:01:00.110 whisk
00:01:00.320 this
00:01:00.440 too
00:01:00.770 much
00:01:00.980 don't

00:01:01.250 incorporate
00:01:01.520 too
00:01:01.880 much
00:01:02.030 air
00:01:02.240 into

00:02:57.019 creamy
00:02:57.709 as
00:02:58.220 opposed
00:02:58.700 that's

00:03:23.329 a

00:03:23.420 massive
00:03:23.629 difference

00:03:27.170 cut
00:03:27.379 through
00:03:27.620 that
00:03:27.769 really

00:03:28.310 beautifully
00:03:29.829 and
00:03:30.829 that's
00:03:30.980 it
00:03:31.190 that's
00:03:31.670 my

00:03:31.970 perfect
00:03:32.599 creamy
00:03:33.410 scrambled
