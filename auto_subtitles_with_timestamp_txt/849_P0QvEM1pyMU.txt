00:00:51.059 around
00:00:54.800 and
00:00:55.800 the
00:00:56.070 reason
00:00:56.370 you

00:00:56.730 want

00:00:56.850 to

00:00:58.020 juice

00:00:58.350 it'll
00:00:58.590 start
00:00:58.829 to
00:00:58.859 cook
00:00:59.070 the
00:00:59.129 chicken
00:00:59.430 so
00:01:00.149 our

00:01:00.329 grill
00:01:00.600 is
00:01:00.870 nice
00:01:01.079 and

00:01:02.309 take
00:01:02.520 this

00:01:02.699 chicken
00:01:03.090 breast
00:01:03.949 and
00:01:04.949 get
00:01:05.129 it
00:01:05.250 right
00:01:05.460 on

00:01:08.680 and
00:01:08.800 now
00:01:09.340 this
00:01:09.910 I'll
00:01:10.330 let
00:01:10.720 cook
00:01:11.020 and
00:01:11.290 then

00:01:11.530 we'll
00:01:11.680 pay
00:01:11.860 attention
00:01:12.370 to
00:01:12.880 the
00:01:13.000 rest
00:01:13.180 of
00:01:13.300 our

00:01:13.450 salad
00:01:13.930 so
00:01:14.890 here
00:01:15.160 is
00:01:15.310 our
00:01:15.460 lettuce
00:01:15.820 and
00:01:16.210 this
00:01:16.540 is

00:01:16.750 organic
00:01:18.120 romaine
00:01:19.120 lettuce
00:01:19.600 and
00:01:19.990 romaine
00:01:20.860 is

00:01:21.130 definitely
00:01:21.910 the
00:01:22.060 kind
00:01:22.210 you
00:01:22.390 want
00:01:22.510 to
00:01:22.630 use
00:01:22.780 for

00:01:22.990 Caesar
00:01:23.230 because
00:01:23.560 it
00:01:23.710 has
00:01:23.860 good
00:01:24.070 crispness
00:01:24.550 so

00:01:25.420 what
00:01:25.600 we'll
00:01:25.750 do
00:01:25.930 here
00:01:25.960 is
00:01:26.560 we'll
00:01:27.520 take
00:01:27.760 our

00:01:28.450 bowl
00:01:28.840 and
00:01:29.460 usually
00:01:30.460 this
00:01:30.610 is
00:01:30.670 just
00:01:31.060 torn
00:01:32.520 you

00:01:33.520 don't
00:01:33.700 really
00:01:33.940 need
00:01:34.210 to
00:01:34.270 use
00:01:34.870 a
00:01:34.900 knife
00:01:35.230 to
00:01:35.440 cut

00:01:35.470 it
00:01:35.770 up
00:01:35.860 just
00:01:36.100 tear
00:01:36.430 it
00:01:36.550 up
00:01:36.610 with
00:01:36.790 your
00:01:36.880 hands

00:01:40.200 the
00:01:41.200 other
00:01:41.230 thing
00:01:41.500 I
00:01:41.590 would
00:01:41.650 say
00:01:41.950 is
00:01:42.010 when

00:01:42.220 you're
00:01:42.250 making
00:01:42.460 a
00:01:42.730 Caesar
00:01:43.030 salad
00:01:43.410 you
00:01:44.410 surely

00:01:44.890 want
00:01:45.070 your
00:01:45.280 serving
00:01:45.790 plate
00:01:45.820 to
00:01:46.450 be
00:01:46.630 very
00:01:47.320 cold

00:01:47.770 because
00:01:48.460 there's
00:01:49.150 nothing
00:01:49.540 worse
00:01:49.750 than
00:01:49.780 warm

00:01:50.500 Caesar
00:01:51.370 salad
00:01:52.000 the
00:01:52.630 biggest
00:01:52.960 reason
00:01:53.290 I
00:01:53.410 don't

00:01:53.470 order
00:01:53.950 it
00:01:54.070 in
00:01:54.220 most
00:01:54.730 restaurants
00:01:55.150 because

00:01:55.630 I've
00:01:55.780 had
00:01:55.930 it
00:01:55.960 come
00:01:56.320 out
00:01:56.350 to
00:01:56.680 me
00:01:56.830 warm
00:01:57.580 too
00:01:57.850 many

00:01:58.030 times
00:01:58.360 and
00:01:58.690 I'm
00:01:59.410 just
00:01:59.680 picky
00:01:59.980 about
00:02:00.010 cold

00:02:00.760 salad
00:02:01.890 and
00:02:02.890 also
00:02:03.040 you
00:02:03.190 want
00:02:03.340 to
00:02:03.430 make
00:02:03.490 sure

00:02:03.700 your
