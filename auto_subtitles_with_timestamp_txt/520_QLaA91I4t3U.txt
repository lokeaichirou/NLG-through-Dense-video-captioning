00:01:14.360 whole
00:01:14.479 Apple
00:01:14.840 in
00:01:14.929 depending

00:01:15.709 how
00:01:15.799 much
00:01:15.920 lettuce
00:01:16.159 Heusen
00:01:16.610 I'm

00:01:21.679 cut
00:01:21.920 into
00:01:22.069 chunks
00:01:22.990 so

00:01:23.990 I'll
00:01:24.080 probably
00:01:24.200 divide
00:01:24.590 it
00:01:24.740 up
00:01:24.799 into
00:01:25.360 eight

00:01:26.360 ten

00:01:27.770 into
00:01:27.890 chunks

00:01:38.440 thing
00:01:38.530 that
00:01:38.710 makes

00:01:42.340 you'd
00:01:42.909 probably
00:01:43.030 want
00:01:43.360 about
00:01:44.310 150
00:01:45.310 grams
