00:01:41.579 about
00:01:41.610 15
00:01:42.360 minutes

00:01:42.780 you're
00:01:42.960 looking
00:01:43.229 for
00:01:43.350 the
00:01:43.409 croutons
00:01:43.799 to
00:01:43.920 crisp

00:01:44.369 up
00:01:44.579 and
00:01:44.820 turn
00:01:45.030 golden
00:01:45.360 brown
00:01:45.600 now
00:01:45.899 for
00:01:46.439 the

00:01:46.530 dressing
00:01:46.979 now
00:01:47.280 a
00:01:47.310 classic
00:01:47.700 Caesar
00:01:48.180 salad

00:01:48.720 typically
00:01:49.170 does
00:01:49.350 have
00:01:49.590 raw
00:01:49.860 egg
00:01:50.159 in
00:01:50.310 it
00:01:50.399 and
00:01:50.579 I

00:01:50.850 know
00:01:50.909 that
00:01:51.270 that
00:01:51.390 can
00:01:51.540 make
00:01:51.570 some
00:01:51.899 people

00:01:52.049 uneasy
00:01:52.530 so
00:01:53.009 instead
00:01:53.399 we're
00:01:53.610 going
00:01:53.729 to
00:01:53.790 use

00:01:53.970 some
00:01:54.180 mayonnaise
00:01:54.630 which
00:01:54.840 is
00:01:54.990 pasteurized
00:01:55.229 so

00:01:55.829 there's
00:01:56.040 no
00:01:56.189 reason
00:01:56.640 to
00:01:56.670 worry

00:01:58.220 then
00:01:59.120 we're
00:01:59.300 gonna
00:01:59.420 add
00:01:59.510 the
00:02:00.140 zest
00:02:00.320 of
00:02:00.560 one

00:02:00.770 lemon
00:02:00.920 and
00:02:01.420 some
00:02:02.420 lemon
00:02:02.630 juice
00:02:03.340 go
00:02:04.340 ahead
00:02:04.610 and

00:02:04.790 give
00:02:04.910 that
00:02:05.060 a
00:02:05.090 good
00:02:05.270 whisk
00:02:05.330 and
00:02:05.840 then
00:02:05.900 it's

00:02:06.650 time
00:02:06.890 for
00:02:06.950 the
00:02:07.280 anchovies
00:02:07.970 now
00:02:08.330 I
00:02:08.360 know

00:02:08.619 anchovies
00:02:09.619 is
00:02:09.800 another
00:02:10.220 controversial

00:02:10.910 subject
00:02:11.510 when
00:02:11.630 it
00:02:11.720 comes
00:02:11.930 to
00:02:12.140 Caesar
00:02:12.350 salad

00:02:12.860 because
00:02:13.340 a
00:02:13.370 real
00:02:13.700 traditionalist
00:02:14.390 will
00:02:14.600 say

00:02:14.780 it
00:02:15.020 is
00:02:15.140 not
00:02:15.320 a
00:02:15.380 Caesar
00:02:15.710 without
00:02:16.190 the
00:02:16.370 anchovies

00:02:17.000 but
00:02:17.420 I
00:02:17.450 know
00:02:17.570 that
00:02:17.900 anchovies
00:02:18.500 can
00:02:18.710 also
00:02:18.920 make

00:02:19.280 people
00:02:19.550 uneasy
00:02:19.760 so
00:02:20.390 what
00:02:20.540 I
00:02:20.570 like
00:02:20.810 to
00:02:20.870 do
00:02:21.140 is

00:02:21.380 instead
00:02:21.560 of
00:02:21.800 taking
00:02:22.190 real
00:02:22.430 anchovies
00:02:23.060 and

00:02:23.240 smashing
00:02:23.870 them
00:02:24.020 up
00:02:24.170 I
00:02:24.350 go
00:02:24.740 right
00:02:24.980 to
00:02:25.130 the
00:02:25.250 paste

00:02:25.490 because
00:02:26.090 then
00:02:26.240 you
00:02:26.360 tend
00:02:26.600 to
00:02:26.660 not
00:02:26.900 even
00:02:27.080 think

00:02:27.410 about
00:02:27.500 it
00:02:27.770 when
00:02:27.980 you
00:02:28.070 measure
00:02:28.310 out
00:02:28.400 the

00:02:28.670 anchovy
00:02:29.150 paste
00:02:29.330 just
00:02:29.870 think
00:02:30.050 of
00:02:30.140 it
00:02:30.230 as
00:02:30.380 a
00:02:30.410 nice

00:02:30.680 flavorful
00:02:31.160 paste
00:02:31.550 then
00:02:32.390 you're
00:02:32.510 gonna
00:02:32.600 add

00:02:32.810 some
00:02:33.290 Worcestershire
00:02:33.800 sauce
00:02:34.120 add

00:02:37.550 until
00:02:38.000 combined

00:02:38.630 and
00:02:38.930 then
00:02:39.650 the
00:02:39.740 final
00:02:40.160 step
00:02:40.370 is
00:02:40.610 to
00:02:40.670 add
00:02:40.970 about

00:02:41.180 1/2
00:02:41.330 a

00:02:44.360 your
00:02:44.600 dressing
00:02:44.960 is
00:02:45.020 done
00:02:45.230 at
00:02:45.470 this

00:02:46.430 point
00:02:46.760 your
00:02:47.000 chicken
00:02:47.390 is
00:02:47.540 probably
00:02:47.960 done

00:02:48.170 marinating
00:02:48.680 and
00:02:48.800 it's
00:02:49.250 time
00:02:49.520 to
00:02:49.730 grill
00:02:49.910 it
00:02:49.940 so

00:02:50.510 go
00:02:50.660 ahead
00:02:50.780 and
00:02:50.990 grill
00:02:51.350 the
00:02:51.470 chicken
00:02:51.500 on

00:02:53.780 done
00:02:54.080 remove
00:02:54.770 it
00:02:54.980 and
00:02:55.130 let

00:02:55.280 it
00:02:55.370 rest
00:02:55.580 for
00:02:55.730 about
00:02:55.880 five
00:02:56.300 minutes

00:02:56.870 that
00:02:57.200 will
00:02:57.410 help
00:02:57.560 retain
00:02:57.950 all
00:02:58.190 the
00:02:58.490 juices

00:02:58.910 into
00:02:59.360 the
00:02:59.480 chicken
00:02:59.810 and
00:02:59.990 make
