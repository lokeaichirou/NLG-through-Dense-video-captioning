00:01:39.750 you
00:01:40.229 can

00:01:40.350 tell
00:01:40.500 Reggiano

00:01:47.130 $45
00:01:47.820 a
00:01:47.850 kilo
00:01:48.090 but
00:01:48.210 that's
00:01:48.509 what
00:01:48.720 it

00:01:48.810 costs

00:02:28.830 oil
00:02:28.860 and
00:02:29.310 you're
00:02:29.430 creating

00:02:36.860 this
00:02:37.860 whole
00:02:38.040 thing

00:02:38.250 though
00:02:38.370 from

00:02:41.640 a
00:02:41.760 boat
00:02:41.910 on
