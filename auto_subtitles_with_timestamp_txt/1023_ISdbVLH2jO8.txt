00:02:57.769 go
00:02:58.099 for
00:02:58.280 Ian
00:02:58.480 but
00:02:59.480 we're
00:02:59.959 gonna
00:03:00.049 let
00:03:00.200 that

00:03:00.319 cook
00:03:00.500 and
00:03:00.799 I'm

00:03:12.349 thoroughly
00:03:14.260 following
00:03:15.260 cooking
00:03:15.579 okay
00:03:16.579 so

00:03:16.639 after
00:03:17.030 looking
00:03:17.659 at
00:03:17.780 this
00:03:17.930 packet
00:03:18.319 this
00:03:18.590 is

00:03:19.400 essentially
00:03:20.060 making
00:03:21.310 General
00:03:22.310 Tso's
00:03:22.519 sauce

00:03:23.120 and
00:03:24.129 each
00:03:25.129 one
00:03:25.310 of
00:03:25.400 these
00:03:25.489 is
00:03:25.669 for
00:03:25.849 one
00:03:26.150 pound

00:03:26.449 of
00:03:26.629 chicken
00:03:27.340 so
00:03:29.620 and
00:03:30.620 on
00:03:30.739 the
00:03:30.829 back
00:03:30.979 you

00:03:31.489 it
00:03:31.609 with
00:03:31.729 soy
00:03:32.000 sauce
00:03:32.150 water
00:03:32.870 sugar
00:03:34.299 if

00:03:35.299 it
00:03:35.510 makes
00:03:35.689 this
00:03:35.810 packet
00:03:36.489 we
00:03:37.489 don't
00:03:37.699 have
00:03:37.909 soy

00:03:38.180 sauce
00:03:39.340 so

00:03:44.689 the

00:03:44.810 soy
00:03:44.930 sauce
00:03:45.049 because
00:03:45.500 it's
00:03:45.739 only
00:03:45.949 3
00:03:46.879 tablespoon

00:03:47.389 and
00:03:50.379 mix
00:03:51.379 those
00:03:51.500 two
00:03:51.709 together
00:03:51.859 and
00:03:52.250 make
00:03:52.310 our

00:03:53.269 General
00:03:53.780 Tso's
00:03:55.449 sauce
00:03:56.449 okay

00:05:28.040 had
00:05:28.130 a
00:05:28.190 little
00:05:28.310 modification
00:05:28.730 along

00:05:29.480 the
00:05:29.630 way

00:05:32.150 General

00:05:32.660 Tso's
00:05:33.160 recipe
00:05:34.160 according
00:05:34.640 to
00:05:34.700 the
00:05:34.790 plan
00:05:35.000 but

00:05:36.310 the
00:05:37.310 combination
00:05:37.850 of
00:05:38.120 the
00:05:38.240 one
00:05:38.390 packet
00:05:38.840 and

00:05:39.080 the
00:05:39.520 bottle
00:05:40.520 of
00:05:40.610 sauce
00:05:40.880 was
00:05:41.750 plenty
00:05:42.170 of
00:05:42.320 sauce

00:05:42.680 and
00:05:43.070 the
00:05:43.910 flavor
00:05:44.240 was
00:05:44.540 great
00:05:45.140 I
00:05:45.410 mean
00:05:45.590 it

00:05:45.860 really
00:05:46.460 had
00:05:46.760 a
00:05:47.120 good
00:05:47.830 strong
00:05:48.830 general
00:05:49.370 tso's

00:05:49.850 flavor
00:05:50.240 to
00:05:50.480 it
00:05:50.590 the
00:05:51.590 only
00:05:51.740 thing
00:05:51.860 I
00:05:51.950 would

00:05:52.070 change
00:05:52.100 is
00:05:52.400 probably
00:05:52.760 put
00:05:53.570 some
00:05:53.690 more

00:05:53.840 vegetables
00:05:54.380 in
00:05:54.500 there
00:05:54.650 with
00:05:54.800 it
00:05:54.950 it
00:05:55.040 was
00:05:55.160 kind

00:05:55.370 of
00:05:55.520 just

00:05:59.390 can
00:06:00.080 of
00:06:00.220 vegetable
00:06:01.220 but
00:06:01.700 I
00:06:02.210 think

00:06:03.200 fresh
00:06:03.410 broccoli
00:06:03.980 or
00:06:04.400 something

00:06:04.700 would
00:06:04.820 be
00:06:04.910 good

00:06:05.330 cooked
00:06:05.660 in
00:06:05.810 with
00:06:05.990 it
00:06:06.880 other
00:06:07.880 than
00:06:07.970 that
00:06:08.090 it
00:06:08.360 was
