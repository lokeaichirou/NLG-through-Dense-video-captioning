00:00:21.640 it

00:00:22.449 absolutely
00:00:23.080 absurd
00:00:23.289 that
00:00:23.949 I
00:00:24.039 have
00:00:24.220 not

00:00:25.720 already
00:00:26.050 I
00:00:26.260 mean

00:00:26.439 what
00:00:27.070 it
00:00:27.279 was
00:00:27.400 I
00:00:27.519 thinking
00:00:27.880 I've
00:00:28.150 been
00:00:28.660 gone

00:00:28.900 I've
00:00:29.439 been
00:00:29.619 doing
00:00:29.830 this
00:00:29.920 for
00:00:30.070 two
00:00:30.220 years
00:00:30.460 and

00:00:30.609 not
00:00:30.820 me
00:00:31.029 to
00:00:31.089 pay
00:00:31.300 a
00:00:31.330 simple
00:00:31.990 plain
00:00:32.439 pancake

00:00:32.950 recipe
00:00:33.370 and
00:00:33.640 then
00:00:33.969 even
00:00:34.149 even
00:00:34.450 dawned
00:00:34.600 on
00:00:34.780 me

00:00:34.840 like
00:00:35.110 just
00:00:35.620 recently
00:00:35.950 I
00:00:36.250 thought
00:00:36.489 all
00:00:37.090 these

00:00:37.329 requests
00:00:37.750 are
00:00:37.809 coming
00:00:38.110 in
00:00:38.290 I
00:00:38.469 must
00:00:38.860 not
00:00:39.010 have

00:00:39.070 an
00:00:39.460 episode
00:00:39.789 up
00:00:39.910 already
00:00:40.210 so
00:00:40.450 I
00:00:40.660 did
00:00:40.960 it
00:00:40.989 and
00:00:41.230 I

00:00:41.710 apologize
00:00:42.129 for

00:00:44.079 requests
00:00:44.649 to
00:00:44.739 make
00:00:44.890 basic
00:00:45.370 pancakes

00:00:45.879 so
00:00:46.329 I
00:00:46.390 figured
00:00:46.719 it
00:00:46.930 is
00:00:47.289 one
00:00:47.469 of
00:00:47.559 the
00:00:47.649 most
00:00:47.829 is

00:00:48.219 the
00:00:49.180 e
00:00:49.210 and
00:00:49.510 one

00:01:27.190 but

00:01:27.640 just
00:01:27.880 by
00:01:28.090 using
00:01:28.270 the
00:01:28.600 1
00:01:28.810 1

00:01:38.200 it
00:01:38.260 couldn't
00:01:38.500 be

00:01:38.530 easier
00:01:38.920 so
00:01:39.430 in
00:01:39.640 this
00:01:39.820 bowl

00:01:44.380 milk
00:01:44.710 and
00:01:44.860 you
00:01:44.980 could
00:01:45.130 use
00:01:45.250 skim
00:01:45.520 milk
00:01:45.730 for

00:01:45.880 this
00:01:45.970 perfectly
00:01:46.600 fine
00:01:47.010 whatever

00:01:52.390 little
00:01:52.450 bit
00:01:52.630 sugar
00:01:52.870 in
00:01:53.200 my
00:01:53.620 recipe

00:01:54.070 which
00:01:54.280 I
00:01:54.460 know
00:01:54.520 it's
00:01:54.790 a
00:01:54.880 bit
00:01:55.030 different
00:01:55.420 but
00:01:55.600 I

00:01:55.840 feel
00:01:56.350 like
00:01:56.560 it
00:01:57.010 needs
00:01:57.580 just
00:01:57.940 a
00:01:58.030 tiny
00:01:58.270 bit
00:01:58.660 of

00:01:58.690 sweetness
00:01:58.900 you
00:01:59.530 know
00:01:59.680 so
00:02:00.430 I
00:02:00.760 do
00:02:01.510 it
00:02:01.780 and
00:02:01.900 it

00:02:01.990 works
00:02:02.080 for
00:02:02.440 me
00:02:02.500 and
00:02:02.770 you
00:02:03.130 don't
00:02:03.340 want
00:02:03.460 to
00:02:03.490 over

00:02:03.670 mix
00:02:03.700 this
00:02:04.060 a
00:02:04.240 lumpy
00:02:04.720 batter
00:02:04.930 is
00:02:05.290 a
00:02:05.350 good
00:02:05.740 batter

00:02:05.980 it's
00:02:06.370 going
00:02:06.910 to
00:02:07.030 be
00:02:07.090 really
00:02:07.390 fluffy
00:02:07.960 and

00:02:08.170 delicious
00:02:08.200 if
00:02:08.770 you
00:02:08.830 over
00:02:09.280 beat
00:02:09.429 this
00:02:09.610 it's

00:02:09.820 gonna
00:02:09.910 be
00:02:10.030 really
00:02:10.149 dense
00:02:10.479 and
00:02:10.810 heavy
00:02:11.050 so
00:02:11.590 see

00:02:11.740 what
00:02:11.860 I
00:02:11.920 did
00:02:12.130 I
00:02:12.310 just
00:02:12.820 ever
00:02:13.570 so
00:02:13.930 lightly
00:02:14.080 mixed

00:02:14.750 together
00:02:15.070 and
00:02:16.070 that's
00:02:16.370 it
00:02:16.520 it's
00:02:16.940 completely

00:02:17.120 done
00:02:17.630 now
00:02:18.160 another
00:02:19.160 important
00:02:19.610 step
00:02:19.790 is
00:02:20.030 that

00:02:20.420 you
00:02:20.510 let
00:02:20.690 this
00:02:20.930 sit
00:02:21.170 for
00:02:21.230 about
00:02:21.500 five
00:02:21.920 to
00:02:22.100 ten

00:02:22.340 minutes
00:02:22.370 it
00:02:23.090 relaxes
00:02:23.780 the
00:02:23.810 gluten
00:02:24.260 which

00:02:24.470 means
00:02:24.680 you're
00:02:24.770 going
00:02:24.860 to
00:02:24.920 get
00:02:25.040 a
00:02:25.070 really

00:02:25.370 fluffy
00:02:25.880 pancake
00:02:26.840 so
00:02:27.050 I'm
00:02:27.110 just
00:02:27.290 going
00:02:27.410 to

00:02:27.500 clean
00:02:27.740 up
00:02:27.770 let
00:02:28.490 this
00:02:28.670 leave
00:02:28.970 it
00:02:29.090 alone
00:02:29.300 for

00:02:29.600 about
00:02:29.690 five
00:02:29.990 minutes
00:02:30.170 or
00:02:30.440 so
00:02:30.650 and
00:02:30.830 then
00:02:30.890 we're

00:02:31.280 ready
00:02:31.459 to
00:02:31.550 cook
00:02:31.670 them
00:02:31.760 up
00:02:31.940 okay
00:02:33.640 my
00:02:34.640 batter
00:02:34.940 has

00:02:35.240 been
00:02:35.390 resting
00:02:35.840 for
00:02:35.870 about
00:02:36.140 five
00:02:36.410 minutes
00:02:36.590 so
