00:03:26.720 a
00:03:26.989 rubber
00:03:27.470 spatula
00:03:28.130 you

00:03:28.160 could
00:03:28.459 also
00:03:28.579 use
00:03:28.910 a
00:03:28.940 wooden
00:03:29.269 spoon
00:03:31.630 and
00:03:32.630 just

00:03:33.319 gently
00:03:33.620 stir
00:03:38.410 these
00:03:39.410 have
00:03:39.680 a
00:03:39.709 little
00:03:40.099 more

00:03:40.310 spongy
00:03:41.950 texture
00:03:42.950 then
00:03:43.750 there's
00:03:44.750 a
00:03:44.840 regular

00:03:45.709 pancake
00:03:46.220 recipe
00:03:46.700 on
00:03:46.819 the
00:03:47.000 site
00:03:47.239 they
00:03:47.690 uses

00:03:48.109 milk
00:03:48.410 and
00:03:48.680 the
00:03:49.160 difference
00:03:49.549 is
00:03:49.730 this
00:03:49.910 is
00:03:50.090 a

00:03:50.120 little
00:03:50.480 more
00:03:50.630 spongy
00:03:51.290 and
00:03:51.530 light
00:03:52.690 both
00:03:53.690 are

00:03:53.900 good
00:03:54.139 of
00:03:55.040 course
00:03:55.310 the
00:03:55.430 buttermilk
00:03:55.700 adds
00:03:56.120 a

00:03:56.329 little
00:03:56.510 bit
00:03:56.629 of
00:03:56.750 Tang
00:03:58.510 okay
00:03:59.510 so
00:03:59.569 that's
00:03:59.959 it
00:04:00.230 and

00:04:01.099 we're

00:04:07.790 electric
00:04:08.560 skillet
00:04:09.560 if
00:04:09.859 you

00:04:10.370 have
00:04:10.519 one
00:04:10.730 of

00:04:14.540 that's
00:04:15.290 180
00:04:15.919 degrees

00:04:16.340 Celsius
00:04:16.910 if
00:04:17.599 you
00:04:17.810 don't
00:04:17.989 have
00:04:18.139 this
00:04:18.260 just
00:04:18.560 you

00:04:18.680 can
00:04:18.799 just
00:04:18.979 use

00:04:25.710 in

00:04:26.010 your
00:04:26.760 pan
00:04:27.000 because

00:04:54.210 the
00:04:54.510 pancake
00:04:54.930 if
00:04:55.080 it's
00:04:55.200 if

00:04:55.410 it's
00:04:55.590 cooking
00:04:56.100 too
00:04:56.280 fast

00:04:56.970 slowly
00:04:57.480 you

00:04:57.720 can

00:05:01.500 vegetable
00:05:02.040 spray
00:05:02.870 my
00:05:03.870 skillet
00:05:05.000 that
00:05:06.000 kind
00:05:06.330 of

00:05:06.420 cuts
00:05:06.600 down
00:05:06.810 on
00:05:06.870 your
00:05:07.200 fat
00:05:07.470 if
00:05:07.740 you're
00:05:07.980 worried

00:05:08.250 about
00:05:08.430 that
00:05:09.020 it's
00:05:10.020 nice
00:05:10.230 and
00:05:10.440 easy
00:05:10.530 to
00:05:10.710 do
00:05:11.010 but

00:05:11.640 you
00:05:11.850 could
00:05:12.090 use
00:05:12.390 some
00:05:12.750 oil
00:05:13.050 or
00:05:13.290 melted
00:05:14.250 butter

00:05:14.700 and
00:05:14.940 you
00:05:15.090 could
00:05:15.240 either
00:05:15.360 brush
00:05:16.170 the
00:05:16.410 oil

00:05:18.420 brush
00:05:18.630 or
00:05:18.960 with
00:05:19.560 a

00:05:19.590 piece
00:05:19.830 of
00:05:19.950 paper
00:05:20.040 towel
00:05:20.400 and
00:05:20.640 then
00:05:21.390 I'm
00:05:22.230 going

00:05:22.470 to
00:05:22.530 use
00:05:22.740 just
00:05:23.370 a
00:05:23.580 ladle
00:05:23.940 of
00:05:24.150 course
00:05:24.420 you
00:05:24.540 can

00:05:24.690 make
00:05:24.810 your
00:05:24.960 pancakes
00:05:25.410 as
00:05:25.560 big
00:05:25.770 or
00:05:25.920 as
00:05:26.040 small
00:05:26.070 as

00:05:26.280 you
00:05:26.460 want
00:05:27.740 if
00:05:28.740 you
00:05:29.610 don't
00:05:29.700 want
00:05:29.820 if
00:05:30.060 you
00:05:30.150 don't

00:05:30.300 have
00:05:30.450 a
00:05:30.480 ladle
00:05:30.870 you
00:05:31.020 could
00:05:31.230 just
00:05:31.410 put
00:05:31.620 this
00:05:31.860 in

00:05:32.130 a
00:05:32.340 large
00:05:32.760 measuring
00:05:33.180 cup
00:05:33.300 and
00:05:33.570 then
00:05:33.690 just
00:05:33.870 pour

00:05:34.140 it
00:05:38.060 so
00:05:39.060 I'm
00:05:39.540 just
00:05:39.840 going
00:05:40.080 to
00:05:41.270 and
00:05:42.270 give
00:05:42.870 your
00:05:43.460 if

00:05:44.460 you're
00:05:44.640 going
00:05:44.850 to
00:05:44.910 put
00:05:45.090 a
00:05:45.120 lot
00:05:45.360 of
00:05:45.510 pancakes
00:05:45.960 on

00:05:46.140 your
00:05:46.320 in
00:05:46.500 your
00:05:46.650 pan
00:05:46.919 make
00:05:47.460 sure
00:05:47.490 you
00:05:48.470 give

00:05:49.470 enough
00:05:49.740 room
00:05:49.770 for
00:05:50.100 spreading
00:05:50.850 you
00:05:51.810 can
00:05:51.960 see

00:05:52.110 this
00:05:52.290 batter
00:05:52.590 is
00:05:52.919 really
00:05:53.910 nice
00:05:54.120 and
00:05:54.390 thick

00:05:54.600 from
00:05:54.870 the
00:05:54.990 buttermilk
00:05:55.260 and
00:05:55.620 I
00:05:55.950 think

00:05:56.160 depending
00:05:57.000 on
00:05:57.180 the
00:05:57.930 buttermilk
00:05:58.410 you
00:05:58.470 buy
00:05:59.240 some

00:06:00.240 are
00:06:00.419 thicker
00:06:00.660 now
00:06:00.930 the
00:06:00.990 one
00:06:01.230 I
00:06:01.260 bought
00:06:01.620 was

00:06:01.980 really
00:06:02.460 quite
00:06:02.730 thick
00:06:03.060 so
00:06:03.090 then
00:06:03.570 that's
00:06:04.530 going

00:06:04.980 to
00:06:05.160 affect
00:06:06.030 the
00:06:06.210 consistency
00:06:07.050 of
00:06:07.080 the
00:06:07.290 batter

00:06:11.390 so
00:06:12.390 I'm
00:06:12.600 just
00:06:13.020 um
00:06:14.330 so
00:06:15.330 we
00:06:15.450 could
00:06:15.690 now
00:06:16.169 if
00:06:16.500 you

00:06:16.710 have
00:06:16.800 a
00:06:16.830 nonstick
00:06:17.340 surface
00:06:17.610 use
00:06:18.150 a
00:06:18.260 spatula

00:06:19.260 not
00:06:19.980 of
00:06:20.160 stainless
00:06:20.460 steel
00:06:20.669 because
00:06:21.000 you
00:06:21.120 don't

00:06:21.360 scratch
00:06:21.600 your
00:06:21.660 surface
00:06:22.020 so
00:06:22.860 you
00:06:23.280 cook
00:06:23.580 these

00:06:23.820 until
00:06:24.560 the
00:06:25.560 tops
00:06:25.860 you'll
00:06:26.370 get
00:06:26.520 lots
00:06:26.669 of

00:06:26.940 bubbles
00:06:27.210 and
00:06:27.720 when
00:06:28.169 some
00:06:28.650 of
00:06:28.770 the
00:06:28.830 bubbles

00:06:29.130 start
00:06:29.400 bursting
00:06:29.669 then
00:06:30.450 you'll
00:06:30.660 know
00:06:30.840 you

00:06:31.080 could
00:06:31.470 also
00:06:31.620 just
00:06:31.950 take
00:06:32.160 your
00:06:32.400 spatula
00:06:32.700 and

00:06:33.270 kind
00:06:33.510 of
00:06:33.630 just
00:06:33.840 take
00:06:34.680 a
00:06:34.710 peek
00:06:35.010 underneath

00:06:35.430 because
00:06:35.940 you
00:06:36.120 want
00:06:36.300 the
00:06:36.419 bottom
00:06:36.750 to
00:06:36.780 be
00:06:36.930 golden

00:06:37.440 Brown
00:06:37.650 and
00:06:37.980 this
00:06:38.730 will
00:06:38.910 take
00:06:39.090 maybe
00:06:39.420 depending

00:06:40.110 on
00:06:40.260 your

00:07:14.790 little
00:07:15.000 crisper
00:07:15.840 and

00:07:18.870 other
00:07:19.140 side
00:07:19.350 usually
00:07:19.830 the
00:07:20.730 second
00:07:21.180 side

00:07:21.420 doesn't
00:07:22.260 take
00:07:22.440 as
00:07:22.620 long
00:07:22.670 plus
00:07:23.670 you
00:07:23.910 will

00:07:24.030 notice
00:07:24.360 that
00:07:24.390 the
00:07:24.720 bottom
00:07:25.380 side
00:07:25.740 doesn't
00:07:26.700 seem

00:07:26.880 to
00:07:27.030 brown
00:07:27.270 quite
00:07:27.630 as
00:07:27.810 much
00:07:28.020 as
00:07:28.260 the
00:07:28.410 top
00:07:28.620 and

00:07:28.830 that's
00:07:29.010 normal
00:07:30.020 okay
00:07:31.460 so
00:07:32.460 pancake
00:07:33.300 done
00:07:33.480 as

00:07:33.630 you
00:07:33.720 can
00:07:33.840 see
00:07:34.020 the
00:07:34.170 second
00:07:34.620 side
00:07:34.830 you
00:07:35.040 kind
00:07:35.280 of

00:07:35.400 it's
00:07:36.150 not
00:07:36.360 a
00:07:36.390 solid
00:07:36.840 brown
00:07:37.500 it's
00:07:37.860 kind
00:07:38.160 of

00:07:38.250 patchy
00:07:38.610 that's
00:07:39.120 how
00:07:39.300 you
00:07:39.360 want
00:07:39.750 it
00:07:39.870 and
00:07:40.200 I
00:07:40.920 have

00:07:41.160 the
00:07:41.340 platter
00:07:41.700 here
00:07:42.150 now
00:07:42.360 I
00:07:42.660 know
00:07:42.840 the
00:07:43.230 tendency

00:07:43.770 is
00:07:43.800 to
00:07:43.980 kind
00:07:44.400 of
00:07:44.460 stack
00:07:44.850 them
00:07:45.210 but
00:07:46.020 the
00:07:46.140 problem

00:07:46.470 with
00:07:46.590 that
00:07:46.620 is
00:07:47.040 if
00:07:47.220 you
00:07:47.340 do
00:07:47.490 that
00:07:47.640 is
00:07:47.850 the

00:07:47.880 bottom
00:07:48.360 ones
00:07:48.510 tend
00:07:48.840 to
00:07:48.930 get
00:07:49.050 soggy
00:07:49.320 so
00:07:49.860 we

00:07:50.070 don't
00:07:50.250 want
00:07:50.400 that
00:07:50.550 so
00:07:50.610 try
00:07:51.300 to
00:07:51.330 have
00:07:51.570 a
00:07:51.600 platter

00:07:51.930 or
00:07:52.230 plate
00:07:52.530 and
00:07:52.770 then
00:07:53.220 you
00:07:53.250 can
00:07:53.610 just
00:07:53.850 space

00:07:54.600 them
00:07:54.630 flat
00:07:55.169 like
00:07:55.470 this
00:07:55.740 now
00:07:56.430 if
00:07:56.700 you
00:07:57.480 weren't

00:07:58.380 going
00:07:58.530 to
00:07:58.590 serve
00:07:58.770 these
00:07:59.010 immediately
00:07:59.640 you

00:08:00.030 could
00:08:00.180 put
00:08:00.419 them
00:08:00.600 in
00:08:00.750 a
00:08:00.780 hundred
00:08:01.110 and

00:08:01.230 seventy-five
00:08:01.650 degree
00:08:02.250 fahrenheit
00:08:03.210 oven

00:08:03.240 that's
00:08:03.630 about
00:08:03.840 80
00:08:04.020 degrees
00:08:05.120 Celsius
00:08:06.120 and
00:08:06.270 just

00:08:06.750 put
00:08:06.900 them
00:08:07.050 right
00:08:07.080 on
00:08:07.500 top
00:08:07.530 of
00:08:07.860 your
00:08:08.070 wire
00:08:08.340 rack

00:08:08.760 and
00:08:09.060 they
00:08:09.450 can
00:08:09.630 stay
00:08:09.870 there
00:08:09.900 15
00:08:10.500 20
00:08:11.040 minutes

00:08:11.370 and
00:08:11.720 so
00:08:13.190 if
00:08:14.190 I
00:08:14.490 want
00:08:14.700 to
00:08:14.760 do
00:08:14.820 another
00:08:15.000 batch
00:08:15.300 I

00:08:15.600 would
00:08:15.780 spray
00:08:16.110 again
00:08:17.330 and
00:08:18.919 then
00:08:19.919 just
00:08:20.220 give

00:08:20.430 your
00:08:21.260 batter
00:08:22.260 a
00:08:22.470 stir

00:08:33.220 now
00:08:33.610 there's
00:08:33.820 two
00:08:34.150 ways
00:08:34.479 if
00:08:34.720 say
00:08:34.930 you
00:08:34.990 didn't

00:08:35.440 want
00:08:35.470 to
00:08:35.710 make
00:08:35.970 all
00:08:36.970 of
00:08:37.030 the
00:08:37.419 pancakes
00:08:38.039 you

00:08:39.039 could
00:08:39.280 just
00:08:39.550 store
00:08:39.940 this
00:08:40.360 batter
00:08:40.780 just
00:08:41.320 cover

00:08:41.680 it
00:08:41.860 and
00:08:42.010 store
00:08:42.280 it
00:08:42.310 in
00:08:42.520 the
00:08:42.640 fridge
00:08:42.970 for

00:08:43.470 usually
00:08:44.470 like
00:08:44.980 24
00:08:45.490 hours
00:08:45.820 and
00:08:45.970 then
00:08:46.060 just
00:08:46.240 give

00:08:46.390 it
00:08:46.510 a
00:08:46.570 real
00:08:46.780 good
00:08:46.810 stir
00:08:47.700 of
00:08:48.700 course
00:08:48.970 not
00:08:49.180 it's

00:08:49.450 not
00:08:49.660 going
00:08:49.810 to
00:08:49.870 be
00:08:49.960 quite
00:08:50.320 as
00:08:50.500 good
00:08:50.740 but
00:08:51.040 it's

00:08:51.340 still
00:08:51.490 pretty
00:08:51.700 good
00:08:51.850 or
00:08:52.150 you
00:08:52.540 could
00:08:52.720 just
00:08:52.750 bake

00:08:53.260 off
00:08:53.500 all
00:08:53.800 your
00:08:54.160 pancakes
00:08:54.790 and
00:08:55.030 then
00:08:55.960 just
00:08:56.350 cool

00:08:56.620 these
00:08:56.890 and
00:08:57.190 you
00:08:57.250 could
00:08:57.430 put
00:08:57.610 them
00:08:57.670 in
00:08:57.820 the

00:08:57.910 freezer
00:08:58.210 and
00:08:58.570 they'll
00:08:59.050 last
00:08:59.260 for
00:08:59.500 about
00:08:59.680 a

00:08:59.710 month
00:08:59.920 and
00:09:00.160 then
00:09:00.460 you
00:09:00.610 could
00:09:00.760 either
00:09:00.880 reheat

00:09:01.420 them
00:09:01.630 in

00:09:05.440 just
00:09:05.470 pop
00:09:05.950 them
00:09:06.160 right
00:09:06.190 into
00:09:06.700 your

00:09:07.140 toaster
00:09:08.140 oven
