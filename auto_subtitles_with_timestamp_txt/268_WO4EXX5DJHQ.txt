00:00:02.060 I'm
00:00:03.060 making
00:00:03.540 beef
00:00:03.750 Burgundy
00:00:04.140 that's
00:00:04.770 a
00:00:04.890 little

00:00:05.069 dressed
00:00:05.430 up
00:00:05.700 not
00:00:06.600 complicated
00:00:07.589 just
00:00:08.250 with
00:00:08.490 a

00:00:08.519 few
00:00:08.790 special
00:00:09.300 touches
00:00:09.570 that
00:00:10.290 really
00:00:10.740 have
00:00:10.889 a

00:00:10.920 great
00:00:11.219 payoff
00:00:11.580 in
00:00:11.940 the
00:00:12.059 flavor
00:00:21.020 so
00:00:22.020 I
00:00:22.230 brown

00:00:22.590 some
00:00:22.920 bacon
00:00:23.340 very
00:00:24.029 quickly
00:00:24.330 over
00:00:24.689 high
00:00:24.869 heat

00:00:25.050 and
00:00:25.529 I
00:00:26.189 also
00:00:26.400 need
00:00:26.789 some
00:00:27.090 drippings
00:00:27.599 to
00:00:28.380 brown

00:00:28.650 the
00:00:28.859 beef
00:00:28.980 cubes
00:00:29.250 in
00:00:29.550 and
00:00:29.789 rather
00:00:30.330 than
00:00:30.599 adding

00:00:30.840 an
00:00:31.199 oil
00:00:31.500 from
00:00:31.800 a
00:00:31.890 bottle
00:00:32.219 I
00:00:32.340 just
00:00:32.579 decided

00:00:33.090 let's
00:00:33.210 use
00:00:33.680 bacon
00:00:34.680 drippings
00:00:34.829 that
00:00:35.160 is
00:00:35.579 so

00:00:35.790 much
00:00:35.940 more
00:00:36.149 flavorful
00:00:36.600 I'm
00:00:37.079 going
00:00:37.440 to
00:00:37.620 toss

00:00:38.160 the
00:00:38.460 beef
00:00:38.610 cubes
00:00:38.850 with
00:00:39.329 some
00:00:39.570 flour
00:00:39.899 because
00:00:40.680 I

00:00:40.800 want
00:00:40.980 to
00:00:41.070 get
00:00:41.160 a
00:00:41.219 nice
00:00:41.489 firm
00:00:41.910 finish
00:00:42.510 on
00:00:42.780 the

00:00:43.350 browned
00:00:44.160 beef
00:00:44.670 and
00:00:44.940 once
00:00:45.899 you
00:00:46.140 can
00:00:46.350 see
00:00:46.850 that

00:00:47.850 it
00:00:48.149 is
00:00:48.329 all
00:00:48.660 well
00:00:48.960 covered
00:00:49.410 then
00:00:50.309 add
00:00:50.670 about

00:00:50.940 half
00:00:51.360 of
00:00:51.570 the
00:00:51.719 cubes
00:00:52.110 at
00:00:52.890 a
00:00:52.949 time
00:00:53.570 yes
00:00:54.570 you

00:00:54.750 might
00:00:54.930 be
00:00:55.079 tempted
00:00:55.500 to
00:00:55.530 speed
00:00:55.949 it
00:00:56.100 up
00:00:56.280 and
00:00:56.579 do

00:00:57.059 it
00:00:57.090 all
00:00:57.360 at
00:00:57.539 once
00:00:57.780 but
00:00:58.260 if
00:00:58.440 you
00:00:58.590 crowd
00:00:58.920 the

00:00:59.190 skillet
00:00:59.699 the
00:01:00.030 beef
00:01:00.239 will
00:01:00.570 steam
00:01:01.050 in
00:01:01.289 its
00:01:01.440 own

00:01:01.649 juices
00:01:02.180 because
00:01:03.180 it
00:01:03.539 doesn't
00:01:03.899 have
00:01:04.049 enough

00:01:04.159 individual
00:01:05.159 contact
00:01:05.760 with
00:01:06.150 the
00:01:06.299 heat
00:01:06.479 of
00:01:06.510 the

00:01:06.720 pan
00:01:06.960 and
00:01:07.320 it
00:01:08.010 doesn't
00:01:08.340 have
00:01:08.490 enough
00:01:08.520 space

00:01:09.119 around
00:01:09.150 it
00:01:09.780 to
00:01:09.960 actually
00:01:10.500 allow
00:01:10.740 the
00:01:10.799 browning

00:01:11.310 to
00:01:11.520 occur
00:01:11.939 so
00:01:12.299 we've
00:01:12.869 got
00:01:13.080 a
00:01:13.110 nice
00:01:13.500 Brown

00:01:14.070 finish
00:01:14.460 on
00:01:15.030 these
00:01:15.479 guys
00:01:15.780 and
00:01:16.610 they
00:01:17.610 will
00:01:17.790 be

00:01:17.909 the
00:01:18.060 first
00:01:18.299 batch
00:01:18.570 of
00:01:18.840 finished
00:01:19.380 beef
00:01:19.619 cubes

00:01:19.860 in
00:01:20.520 they
00:01:20.880 go
00:01:21.979 and
00:01:22.979 now
00:01:23.189 time
00:01:23.820 for
00:01:23.850 the
00:01:24.060 second

00:01:24.420 batch
00:01:24.570 which
00:01:24.900 has
00:01:25.049 been
00:01:25.290 nicely

00:01:27.960 into
00:01:28.560 the
00:01:29.189 pan
00:01:29.549 so

00:01:30.450 we've
00:01:30.600 got
00:01:30.750 the
00:01:30.869 kind
00:01:31.079 of
00:01:31.200 brown
00:01:31.380 finish
00:01:31.829 on

00:01:32.790 the
00:01:33.060 second
00:01:33.420 batch
00:01:33.600 that
00:01:33.930 I've

00:01:34.049 been
00:01:34.200 looking
00:01:34.350 for
00:01:34.560 and
00:01:35.040 it's
00:01:35.700 time
00:01:35.939 to
00:01:35.970 put

00:01:36.240 them
00:01:36.390 into

00:01:57.450 this
00:01:58.170 will
00:01:58.380 add

00:01:58.590 immeasurably
00:01:59.280 to
00:02:00.119 the
00:02:00.240 flavor
00:02:00.570 of
00:02:00.689 the

00:03:04.510 and
00:03:04.750 that
00:03:04.780 is
00:03:05.500 adding

00:03:07.660 and
00:03:08.230 you

00:03:11.920 the
00:03:12.130 tomatoey
00:03:12.850 flavor
00:03:13.000 to

00:03:18.519 keep
00:03:18.760 the
00:03:18.940 intensity
00:03:19.510 of
00:03:19.690 the

00:03:19.810 tomato
00:03:20.170 flavor
00:03:20.410 by
00:03:20.769 adding
00:03:21.100 it
00:03:21.220 near
00:03:21.400 the

00:03:22.000 the
00:03:22.540 fresh
00:03:22.750 mushrooms
00:03:23.290 go
