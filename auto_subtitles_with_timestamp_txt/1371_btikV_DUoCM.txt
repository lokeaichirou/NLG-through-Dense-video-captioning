00:00:12.920 traditional
00:00:13.519 English

00:00:13.940 pub
00:00:14.260 big
00:00:15.260 mistake
00:00:15.769 unless
00:00:16.129 of
00:00:16.460 course
00:00:16.490 you

00:00:16.880 want

00:00:21.439 kind
00:00:21.679 of
00:00:21.949 meat
00:00:22.130 inside

00:00:22.489 them
00:00:22.759 now
00:00:23.060 if
00:00:23.449 you're
00:00:23.659 comparing
00:00:24.109 an
00:00:24.230 English

00:00:24.560 view
00:00:24.800 to
00:00:24.980 say
00:00:25.189 fine
00:00:25.819 French
00:00:26.210 cuisine
00:00:26.630 or
00:00:26.900 maybe

00:00:27.050 some
00:00:27.289 Japanese
00:00:27.800 sushi
00:00:28.099 then
00:00:28.369 of
00:00:28.489 course
00:00:28.669 it

00:00:28.789 doesn't
00:00:28.939 have
00:00:29.089 the
00:00:29.239 finesse
00:00:29.630 with
00:00:30.079 those

00:00:30.230 cuisines
00:00:30.649 but
00:00:31.429 it
00:00:31.550 has
00:00:31.730 something
00:00:32.119 different

00:00:32.570 it
00:00:32.870 has
00:00:37.059 nothing
00:00:38.059 in
00:00:39.550 a
00:00:43.539 smooth
00:01:12.010 strainer
00:01:13.870 see

00:01:14.870 wine
00:01:15.110 so
00:01:15.800 these
00:01:15.920 are
00:01:16.070 really
00:01:16.400 really
00:01:16.730 possible

00:01:17.360 carefully
00:01:18.080 hats
00:01:18.320 well
00:01:19.130 once
00:01:19.370 you
00:01:19.490 speed
00:01:19.790 now

00:01:19.940 the
00:01:20.000 last
00:01:20.330 the
00:01:20.600 potato
00:01:22.240 into
00:01:23.240 a
00:01:24.080 sieve
00:01:24.880 this
00:01:25.880 is

00:01:26.300 where
00:01:27.460 the
00:01:28.460 hard
00:01:28.730 work
00:01:29.590 is
00:01:30.590 push

00:01:31.430 potato

00:01:31.820 through
00:01:32.780 the
00:01:32.930 sieve
00:01:33.170 into
00:01:33.350 a
00:01:33.560 bowl
00:01:33.590 back
00:01:34.280 to

00:01:34.460 the
00:01:34.580 spoon
00:01:34.910 now

00:01:36.290 reason
00:01:36.500 I'm
00:01:36.590 doing
00:01:36.770 this

00:01:36.890 because
00:01:37.310 it
00:01:37.610 makes
00:01:37.790 the
00:01:38.090 smoothest

00:01:41.480 obviously
00:01:41.660 an
00:01:42.470 easy
00:01:42.740 way
00:01:42.980 to
00:01:43.010 make

00:01:47.030 put
00:01:47.150 a

00:01:47.180 knife
00:01:47.390 through
00:01:47.420 them
