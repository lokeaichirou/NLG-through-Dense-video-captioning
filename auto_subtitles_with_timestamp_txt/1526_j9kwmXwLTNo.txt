00:04:00.330 do
00:04:00.420 the
00:04:00.570 show
00:04:00.780 so
00:04:01.080 this

00:04:01.650 could
00:04:01.890 be
00:04:02.010 a
00:04:02.040 complete
00:04:02.520 failure
00:04:03.020 so
00:04:04.020 we're

00:04:04.140 gonna
00:04:04.260 do
00:04:05.450 an
00:04:06.450 egg
00:04:06.920 scrambled

00:04:13.300 put

00:04:15.020 there
00:04:16.630 and
00:04:17.630 you're

00:04:17.750 gonna
00:04:17.870 mix
00:04:18.140 up
00:04:18.320 the
00:04:18.380 slurry

00:04:24.100 it's
00:04:25.100 like
00:04:25.250 flour
00:04:25.520 it's
00:04:25.820 gonna
00:04:25.910 get
00:04:26.090 really

00:04:26.390 messy
00:04:27.230 so
00:04:28.000 just
00:04:29.000 deal
00:04:29.210 with
00:04:29.240 it
00:04:31.030 see
00:04:32.030 it
00:04:32.150 it's

00:04:32.720 almost
00:04:32.870 like
00:04:33.200 caramel
00:04:33.980 or
00:04:34.130 something
00:04:34.550 it's

00:04:34.700 really
00:04:34.880 weird
00:04:38.740 all
00:04:39.740 right
00:04:39.800 let's
00:04:40.040 put
00:04:40.250 it
00:04:40.340 in
00:04:40.400 a

00:04:40.460 piece
00:04:40.610 of
00:04:40.760 chicken
00:04:41.030 and
00:04:41.090 see
00:04:41.210 how
00:04:41.300 it
00:04:41.390 works

00:04:41.980 make
00:04:42.980 sure
00:04:43.100 your
00:04:43.250 hands
00:04:43.400 are
00:04:43.520 clean
00:04:43.640 by
00:04:43.910 the

00:04:43.970 way
00:04:53.560 like
00:04:54.560 really
00:04:55.750 pasty

00:05:01.020 okay
00:05:01.830 so
00:05:01.890 you
00:05:02.100 dip
00:05:02.250 your
00:05:02.430 chicken
00:05:02.730 in
00:05:02.820 there

00:05:02.970 it's
00:05:03.120 gonna
00:05:03.420 be
00:05:03.600 gummy
00:05:03.870 but
00:05:04.110 when
00:05:04.230 you
00:05:04.290 pull
00:05:04.500 it

00:05:04.650 out
00:05:04.940 there
00:05:05.940 is
00:05:06.060 gonna
00:05:06.210 be
00:05:06.300 some
00:05:06.450 excess
00:05:06.780 so
00:05:06.990 let

00:05:07.140 it
00:05:07.230 drip
00:05:07.470 I
00:05:07.740 don't
00:05:08.130 know
00:05:08.220 why
00:05:08.430 it's
00:05:09.390 so
00:05:09.720 gummy

00:05:10.080 and
00:05:10.320 yet

00:05:12.660 you're
00:05:12.870 gonna
00:05:12.960 coat
00:05:13.200 it
00:05:13.320 like
00:05:13.440 that

00:05:13.640 once
00:05:14.640 the
00:05:14.850 excess
00:05:15.150 is
00:05:15.270 done
00:05:15.540 take
