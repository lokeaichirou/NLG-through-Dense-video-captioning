00:02:42.290 comes
00:02:42.470 together
00:02:42.709 you

00:02:43.190 don't

00:04:45.880 minutes
00:04:46.150 more
00:04:46.270 cooking
00:04:46.630 time
00:04:46.810 so
00:04:46.840 I'm
00:04:47.080 just

00:04:47.139 going
00:04:47.380 to

00:04:47.710 our
00:04:47.950 ketchup
00:04:48.370 sauce
00:04:48.580 and
00:04:48.970 just

00:04:49.510 pour
00:04:49.810 it
00:04:49.930 right
00:04:50.050 over
00:04:50.740 the
00:04:50.860 meatloaf
00:04:51.190 and
00:04:51.340 just

00:04:51.550 spread
00:04:51.760 it
00:04:51.790 out
00:04:51.940 evenly

00:04:56.930 and
00:04:57.100 the
00:04:58.100 same
00:04:58.280 steps
00:04:58.639 apply
00:04:58.790 for
00:04:59.210 the
00:04:59.300 turkey

00:05:04.970 once
00:05:05.970 the
00:05:06.150 beef
00:05:06.330 meatloaf
00:05:06.630 is
00:05:06.960 done
00:05:07.200 you're

00:05:07.530 going
00:05:07.650 to
00:05:07.710 see
00:05:07.830 how
00:05:07.980 much
00:05:08.100 fat
00:05:08.430 has
00:05:08.670 rendered

00:05:08.700 out
00:05:09.240 and
00:05:09.600 you
00:05:10.230 can
00:05:10.350 actually
00:05:10.530 use
00:05:10.890 a
00:05:10.920 couple
00:05:11.250 of

00:05:11.340 tablespoons
00:05:11.820 of
00:05:11.940 that
00:05:12.120 fat
00:05:12.360 as
00:05:12.540 a
00:05:12.570 base
00:05:12.900 to

00:05:13.860 make

00:05:14.400 in
00:05:14.640 a
00:05:15.090 skillet

00:05:15.720 you
00:05:15.840 can

00:05:15.990 make
