00:03:33.120 hate
00:03:33.690 overcooking

00:03:35.550 think
00:03:35.760 of

00:03:35.850 a
00:03:36.000 meatloaf

00:03:38.880 approaching
00:03:39.420 well
00:03:40.350 medium
00:03:40.830 well
00:03:41.040 well
00:03:41.340 so
00:03:41.880 why

00:03:42.000 would
00:03:42.180 you
00:03:42.270 overcook
00:03:42.630 a
00:03:42.660 meatloaf
