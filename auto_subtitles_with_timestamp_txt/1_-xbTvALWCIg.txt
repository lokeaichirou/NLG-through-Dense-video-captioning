00:00:00.930 another
00:00:01.079 sushi
00:00:01.469 video

00:00:01.709 tutorial
00:00:02.190 I'm
00:00:02.310 chef
00:00:02.580 Devaux
00:00:02.760 and
00:00:03.090 today
00:00:03.179 I'm

00:00:03.389 going
00:00:03.510 to
00:00:03.600 show
00:00:03.750 you
00:00:03.780 guys
00:00:04.049 how
00:00:04.230 to
00:00:04.259 make

00:00:04.440 something
00:00:04.620 spectacular
00:00:05.210 something

00:00:06.529 impossible
00:00:07.529 something
00:00:08.309 revolutionary

00:00:08.700 something
00:00:09.860 innovative
00:00:10.860 it's
00:00:11.790 possibly
00:00:12.389 the

00:00:12.630 future
00:00:12.990 of
00:00:13.080 sushi
00:00:13.410 although
00:00:13.920 it
00:00:14.219 might
00:00:14.639 not
00:00:14.849 be

00:00:15.030 who
00:00:15.570 knows
00:00:15.780 but
00:00:16.529 what's
00:00:17.070 certain
00:00:17.310 is
00:00:17.520 over
00:00:17.760 the

00:00:17.820 last
00:00:17.940 hundred
00:00:18.240 years
00:00:18.449 sushi
00:00:18.960 has
00:00:19.080 evolved
00:00:19.350 so

00:00:19.619 much
00:00:19.650 from
00:00:20.300 something
00:00:21.300 that
00:00:21.330 took
00:00:21.510 six
00:00:21.750 months

00:00:22.170 to
00:00:22.320 make
00:00:22.470 by
00:00:22.740 fermenting
00:00:23.070 rice
00:00:23.519 and
00:00:23.850 fish

00:00:24.029 together
00:00:24.300 to
00:00:24.750 something
00:00:25.350 which
00:00:25.439 is
00:00:25.560 made

00:00:25.710 instantly
00:00:26.279 in
00:00:26.369 sushi
00:00:26.550 bars
00:00:26.699 across
00:00:27.180 the

00:00:27.269 country
00:00:27.630 so
00:00:28.500 this
00:00:29.130 could
00:00:29.429 be
00:00:29.550 the
00:00:29.670 future

00:00:29.820 basically
00:00:30.750 I
00:00:31.199 use
00:00:31.410 a
00:00:31.439 Sumi
00:00:31.830 machine
00:00:32.160 to
00:00:32.399 cook

00:00:32.610 the
00:00:32.759 fish
00:00:32.910 to
00:00:33.090 an
00:00:33.149 exact
00:00:33.540 temperature
00:00:34.280 40

00:00:35.280 degrees
00:00:35.579 Celsius
00:00:36.090 and
00:00:36.270 then
00:00:37.110 what
00:00:37.410 happens
00:00:37.770 is

00:00:37.920 the
00:00:38.129 fact
00:00:38.399 dislocates
00:00:39.239 the
00:00:39.450 fish
00:00:39.629 and
00:00:39.930 you

00:00:40.469 create
00:00:40.770 these
00:00:40.950 sesame
00:00:41.160 sized
00:00:41.670 fish
00:00:42.239 flakes

00:00:42.660 which
00:00:43.350 are
00:00:43.559 juicy
00:00:44.070 and
00:00:44.190 tender
00:00:44.430 and
00:00:44.760 perfectly

00:00:45.600 cooked
00:00:46.100 unlike
00:00:47.100 anything
00:00:47.399 you'll
00:00:47.610 ever
00:00:47.850 be

00:00:48.000 able
00:00:48.059 to
00:00:48.210 achieve
00:00:48.270 in
00:00:48.539 a
00:00:48.600 pan
00:00:48.840 or
00:00:48.870 pot
00:00:49.230 and

00:00:49.640 they're
00:00:50.640 just
00:00:51.320 magnificent

00:00:52.469 it's
00:00:52.620 a
00:00:52.649 completely
00:00:53.070 new
00:00:53.460 way
00:00:53.640 to
00:00:53.670 love
00:00:53.940 sushi

00:00:54.239 so
00:00:54.899 I
00:00:55.199 hope
00:00:55.350 you
00:00:55.469 guys
00:00:55.590 enjoy
00:00:55.949 this
00:00:56.070 little

00:00:56.250 video
00:00:56.510 let's
00:00:57.510 get
00:00:57.660 straight
00:00:57.780 into
00:00:57.930 making
00:00:58.140 it

00:00:58.260 let's
00:00:58.770 go
00:01:03.650 it's
00:01:04.650 the
00:01:04.680 first
00:01:04.979 thing
00:01:05.070 you
00:01:05.129 want

00:01:05.369 to
00:01:05.400 do
00:01:05.580 is
00:01:05.700 you
00:01:05.790 want
00:01:05.939 to
00:01:06.000 get
00:01:06.119 a
00:01:06.180 nice
00:01:06.360 piece
00:01:06.540 of

00:01:06.600 salmon
00:01:06.960 with
00:01:07.439 the
00:01:07.680 grain
00:01:08.070 going
00:01:08.430 right
00:01:08.760 across

00:01:09.060 and
00:01:09.510 you
00:01:09.930 don't
00:01:10.170 want
00:01:10.380 a
00:01:10.619 curving
00:01:11.580 of
00:01:11.700 the

00:01:11.850 grain
00:01:12.060 so
00:01:12.330 I've
00:01:12.450 cut
00:01:12.689 it
00:01:12.810 specifically
00:01:13.380 to
00:01:13.740 be

00:01:13.890 like
00:01:14.070 so
00:01:14.570 now
00:01:15.570 you
00:01:16.049 just
00:01:16.200 want
00:01:16.380 to
00:01:16.470 make
00:01:16.590 the

00:01:16.710 brine
00:01:16.979 which
00:01:17.310 is
00:01:17.460 simply
00:01:18.290 500
00:01:19.290 milliliters
00:01:19.710 of

00:01:19.740 water
00:01:20.570 and
00:01:21.570 then
00:01:22.409 six
00:01:22.860 percent
00:01:23.250 salt
00:01:24.110 and
00:01:25.670 four

00:01:26.670 percent
00:01:27.000 sugar
00:01:27.390 I
00:01:28.130 just
00:01:29.130 want
00:01:29.280 to
00:01:29.369 let
00:01:29.430 this

00:01:29.579 dissolve
00:01:29.909 inside
00:01:31.070 and
00:01:32.600 then
00:01:33.600 add
00:01:33.810 your
00:01:33.990 fish

00:01:41.910 okay
00:01:42.910 so
00:01:43.060 it's
00:01:43.300 been
00:01:43.330 24
00:01:43.840 hours
00:01:43.900 since
00:01:44.110 I

00:01:44.440 brined
00:01:44.770 the
00:01:44.950 fish
00:01:45.190 and
00:01:45.400 I
00:01:45.490 just
00:01:45.670 Pat
00:01:45.880 it
00:01:46.000 dry

00:01:46.150 and
00:01:46.510 what's
00:01:47.110 happened
00:01:47.530 is
00:01:47.710 the
00:01:47.890 brine
00:01:48.130 has

00:01:48.430 seasoned
00:01:48.940 the
00:01:49.030 fish
00:01:49.060 perfectly
00:01:49.780 and
00:01:50.020 it's

00:01:50.860 changed
00:01:51.250 structure
00:01:51.700 so
00:01:51.880 the
00:01:52.090 albumin
00:01:52.600 doesn't

00:01:52.870 leach
00:01:53.020 out
00:01:53.260 the
00:01:53.470 albumin
00:01:53.920 is
00:01:54.010 the
00:01:54.100 white
00:01:54.280 stuff

00:01:54.520 that
00:01:54.700 usually
00:01:54.820 coats
00:01:55.270 the
00:01:55.480 outside
00:01:55.510 of
00:01:56.050 some

00:03:02.980 and
00:03:03.540 get

00:03:04.540 right
00:03:04.810 in
00:03:04.990 between
00:03:05.310 layers
00:03:06.310 of
00:03:06.520 fat
00:03:06.940 and

00:03:07.180 separated
00:03:07.950 like
00:03:08.950 so
00:03:09.160 this
00:03:09.340 piece
00:03:09.700 a
00:03:09.730 little

00:03:09.940 bit
00:03:10.120 small
00:03:10.420 and
00:03:12.720 just
00:03:13.720 like
00:03:13.959 so
00:03:15.000 they
00:03:16.000 come
00:03:16.209 off

00:03:16.330 pretty
00:03:16.540 easy
00:03:16.840 and
00:03:18.060 it's
00:03:19.060 almost
00:03:19.360 like
00:03:19.630 sashimi

00:03:20.260 slices
00:03:20.380 but
00:03:21.010 not
00:03:21.310 quite
00:03:21.610 because
00:03:21.640 it's
00:03:22.090 not

00:03:22.240 the
00:03:22.360 way
00:03:22.390 you
00:03:22.480 cut
00:03:22.780 a
00:03:22.810 seam

00:03:27.860 okay
00:03:28.860 so
00:03:29.010 you
00:03:29.100 just
00:03:29.250 put
00:03:29.880 your
00:03:30.000 knife
00:03:30.180 in

00:03:30.390 between
00:03:30.420 the
00:03:30.780 fat
00:03:30.930 layer
00:03:31.320 and
00:03:31.590 it
00:03:31.680 just
00:03:31.860 comes

00:03:32.220 apart
00:03:32.430 and
00:03:33.300 just
00:03:33.540 help
00:03:33.990 it
00:03:34.140 slightly
00:03:34.380 with

00:03:34.590 your
00:03:34.620 hand
00:03:34.950 and
00:03:36.200 this
00:03:37.200 is
00:03:37.380 so
00:03:37.710 soft
00:03:38.270 it's
00:03:39.270 just

00:03:39.420 incredible
00:03:40.970 okay
00:03:41.970 so
00:03:42.180 you
00:03:42.240 place
00:03:42.600 your
00:03:42.780 knife

00:03:42.990 in
00:03:43.260 between
00:03:43.320 the
00:03:43.770 fat
00:03:43.890 layer
00:03:44.280 and
00:03:44.400 she's
00:03:44.640 just

00:03:44.820 slide
00:03:45.240 in
00:03:45.510 and
00:03:45.840 it
00:03:46.680 just
00:03:46.970 comes
00:03:47.970 off
00:03:48.300 the

00:03:48.510 fish-like
00:03:48.750 so
00:03:50.360 it's
00:03:51.360 extremely
00:03:51.960 soft
00:03:52.230 because

00:03:52.680 what's
00:03:53.370 happened
00:03:53.730 during
00:03:53.850 the
00:03:54.090 soft
00:03:54.750 cooking

00:03:58.100 the

00:03:59.100 tender
00:03:59.640 tender
00:03:59.940 fish
00:04:00.330 is
00:04:00.510 just
00:04:00.720 so
00:04:01.050 soft
00:04:01.530 and

00:04:02.360 juicy
00:04:03.360 that
00:04:03.780 it
00:04:04.020 just
00:04:04.260 falls
00:04:04.560 apart

00:05:07.220 you

00:05:07.460 enjoyed
00:05:07.820 watching

00:05:08.330 to
00:05:08.360 make

00:05:08.630 this
00:05:08.810 delicately
00:05:09.500 cooked
00:05:09.770 salmon
00:05:10.040 sashimi

00:05:10.310 and
00:05:10.870 if
00:05:11.870 you
00:05:12.020 want
00:05:12.200 to
00:05:12.290 make
00:05:12.410 it
00:05:12.560 without
00:05:12.680 the

00:05:12.950 stream
00:05:13.220 machine
00:05:13.490 it's
00:05:13.670 possible
00:05:14.240 but
00:05:14.540 it

00:05:14.810 would
00:05:14.960 take
00:05:15.110 a
00:05:15.140 lot
00:05:15.410 of
00:05:15.470 effort
00:05:15.680 you'd
00:05:15.980 have
00:05:16.130 to

00:05:16.250 sit
00:05:16.460 there
00:05:16.730 and
00:05:16.910 turn
00:05:17.630 the
00:05:17.930 gas
00:05:18.110 on
00:05:18.380 and
00:05:18.530 off

00:05:18.650 and
00:05:18.920 watch
00:05:19.070 it
00:05:19.220 with
00:05:19.310 a
00:05:19.370 thermometer
00:05:19.640 for
00:05:20.000 27

00:05:20.630 minutes
00:05:20.690 which
00:05:21.050 would
00:05:21.290 be
00:05:21.440 hell
00:05:21.680 so
00:05:22.070 I
00:05:22.370 would

00:05:23.120 suggest
00:05:23.270 just
00:05:23.570 making
00:05:23.930 the
00:05:23.990 investment
00:05:24.500 it's

00:05:24.710 the
00:05:24.830 same
00:05:25.010 as
00:05:25.160 any
00:05:25.280 other
00:05:25.520 cooking
00:05:25.700 machine
00:05:25.940 in

00:05:26.210 your
00:05:26.360 kitchen
00:05:26.570 it's
00:05:27.410 it
00:05:27.920 cost
00:05:28.250 money
00:05:28.400 so
00:05:29.120 if

00:05:29.510 you
00:05:29.600 want
00:05:29.750 to
00:05:29.840 buy
00:05:29.990 it
00:05:30.050 you
00:05:30.470 can
00:05:30.500 just
