00:00:06.839 high
00:00:06.990 country

00:00:07.859 today
00:00:08.280 we're
00:00:08.639 going
00:00:08.790 to
00:00:08.880 follow

00:00:08.970 the
00:00:09.210 seventh

00:00:27.870 okay
00:00:28.870 so
00:00:29.350 now
00:00:29.830 we're
00:00:29.980 going
00:00:30.100 to
00:00:30.810 sashimi
00:00:31.810 this

00:00:32.110 bullet
00:00:32.410 and
00:00:33.190 I'll
00:00:33.400 turn
00:00:33.580 it
00:00:33.700 back
00:00:34.540 over
00:00:34.690 again

00:00:36.180 and
00:00:37.180 if
00:00:38.140 we
00:00:38.290 were
00:00:38.380 doing
00:00:38.590 sashimi
00:00:39.070 in
00:00:39.280 the
00:00:39.550 shop

00:00:39.760 here
00:00:40.000 at
00:00:40.090 high
00:00:40.239 country
00:00:40.420 salmon
00:00:41.340 we
00:00:42.340 sort
00:00:42.550 of

00:00:42.610 do
00:00:42.760 it
00:00:42.790 a
00:00:43.030 quick
00:00:43.540 way

00:00:44.020 I'm
00:00:44.379 sure
00:00:44.590 it's
00:00:45.720 slightly
00:00:46.720 different
00:00:47.110 then

00:00:47.470 proper
00:00:48.309 sushi
00:00:48.760 chefs
00:00:48.970 would
00:00:49.180 do
00:00:49.360 it
00:00:49.530 but
00:00:50.530 here

00:00:50.739 in
00:00:50.830 the
00:00:50.890 shop
00:00:51.129 and
00:00:51.430 we
00:00:52.120 go
00:00:52.270 through
00:00:52.449 so
00:00:52.629 much

00:00:52.840 that
00:00:53.320 we
00:00:53.500 have
00:00:53.830 to
00:00:54.070 do
00:00:54.250 it
00:00:54.370 quite
00:00:54.580 fast
00:00:54.960 so
00:00:56.070 what

00:00:57.070 we
00:00:57.160 do
00:00:57.310 is
00:00:57.489 we
00:00:57.610 cut
00:00:57.790 the
00:00:57.880 pin
00:00:58.060 bones
00:00:58.239 out
00:00:58.620 so
00:00:59.620 you

00:00:59.710 want
00:00:59.890 to
00:00:59.950 just
00:01:00.160 put
00:01:00.850 your
00:01:00.940 knife
00:01:01.120 just
00:01:02.310 behind

00:01:03.310 the
00:01:03.460 pin
00:01:03.610 bones
00:01:03.760 there
00:01:04.059 run
00:01:04.270 it
00:01:04.420 along
00:01:04.509 not
00:01:05.110 all

00:01:05.259 the
00:01:05.440 way
00:01:05.530 down
00:01:05.800 just
00:01:05.830 sort
00:01:06.580 of
00:01:06.640 work
00:01:07.090 your
00:01:07.330 way

00:01:07.420 down
00:01:07.450 and
00:01:08.100 the
00:01:09.100 idea
00:01:09.430 is
00:01:09.550 to
00:01:09.729 try
00:01:09.880 and
00:01:10.090 get
00:01:10.300 them

00:01:10.450 out
00:01:10.600 with
00:01:10.869 there's
00:01:11.470 a
00:01:11.560 little
00:01:11.830 flesh
00:01:12.100 stuck
00:01:12.700 to

00:01:12.820 them
00:01:12.970 as
00:01:13.240 possible
00:01:13.600 I
00:01:14.250 should
00:01:15.250 just
00:01:15.550 go
00:01:15.700 right

00:01:15.940 down
00:01:16.149 to
00:01:16.210 the
00:01:16.390 bottom
00:01:16.720 see
00:01:16.899 I've
00:01:17.050 gone
00:01:17.229 right

00:01:17.979 down
00:01:18.190 and
00:01:18.490 it
00:01:18.729 smooth
00:01:18.970 opens
00:01:19.570 it
00:01:19.690 up
00:01:21.600 you
00:01:22.600 know

00:01:22.840 if
00:01:23.110 you
00:01:23.200 just
00:01:23.380 run
00:01:23.500 your
00:01:23.530 finger
00:01:23.950 along
00:01:24.399 you

00:01:25.030 can
00:01:25.210 feel
00:01:25.450 where
00:01:25.840 they
00:01:25.960 end
00:01:26.459 which
00:01:27.459 is
00:01:27.640 about

00:01:27.819 there
00:01:28.030 somewhere

00:01:29.310 and
00:01:30.310 just
00:01:30.789 do
00:01:30.910 the
00:01:31.030 same
00:01:31.240 on
00:01:31.630 the
00:01:31.840 other
00:01:31.869 side

00:01:32.729 it
00:01:33.729 was
00:01:34.950 closing
00:01:35.950 you
00:01:36.250 can
00:01:36.369 get

00:01:38.180 just
00:01:38.720 along
00:01:38.960 like
00:01:39.170 that
00:01:39.410 now
00:01:40.160 this
00:01:40.640 but
00:01:40.880 it's

00:01:41.420 quite
00:01:41.600 tricky
00:01:41.870 the
00:01:42.620 pin
00:01:42.800 bones
00:01:43.010 go
00:01:43.310 down
00:01:43.580 on
00:01:44.000 an

00:01:44.210 angle
00:01:44.300 that
00:01:45.230 way
00:01:45.910 towards
00:01:46.910 the
00:01:47.060 tail

00:01:48.100 diagonally
00:01:49.360 so
00:01:50.360 if
00:01:50.720 you
00:01:50.840 just
00:01:50.990 run

00:01:53.920 just
00:01:54.920 sort
00:01:55.070 of

00:01:55.130 feel
00:01:55.310 them
00:01:55.520 where
00:01:55.850 they
00:01:55.970 end
00:01:56.590 just
00:01:57.590 like

00:01:59.930 the
00:02:00.110 tail
00:02:00.290 end

00:04:49.800 then
00:04:50.120 and
00:04:51.120 also
00:04:51.360 quite
00:04:51.600 quite
00:04:52.140 chewy
00:04:52.350 so
00:04:52.890 we

00:04:53.220 would
00:04:53.490 generally
00:04:54.330 just
00:04:54.540 use
00:04:54.920 these
00:04:55.920 butts

00:04:56.130 we've
00:04:56.280 got
00:04:58.070 we
00:04:59.070 just
00:04:59.280 put
00:04:59.430 those
00:05:01.100 those
00:05:02.100 in
00:05:02.310 a

00:05:02.400 nice
00:05:02.610 nice
00:05:03.330 pile
00:05:03.660 over
00:05:03.990 there

00:05:18.139 like
00:05:19.139 so
00:05:19.440 the
00:05:19.970 next
00:05:20.970 I
00:05:21.270 do
00:05:21.539 the
00:05:21.660 line
00:05:21.870 or
00:05:22.289 the

00:05:22.740 top
00:05:22.919 part
00:05:23.160 of
00:05:23.250 the
00:05:23.340 Philip
00:05:24.229 and
00:05:25.229 this
00:05:25.500 one's

00:05:25.710 slightly
00:05:26.130 different
00:05:27.530 it's
00:05:28.530 got
00:05:28.680 a
00:05:28.710 few
00:05:28.919 ways

00:05:29.130 ways
00:05:29.910 that
00:05:30.120 it
00:05:30.210 can
00:05:30.330 be
00:05:30.389 done
00:05:30.599 but
00:05:30.840 generally

00:05:31.289 it's
00:05:31.440 cut
00:05:32.030 with
00:05:33.030 the
00:05:33.780 green
00:05:36.650 so
00:05:37.650 you
00:05:37.710 can
00:05:37.830 see

00:05:37.979 the
00:05:38.160 lines
00:05:38.729 on
00:05:38.970 it
00:05:39.000 they

00:05:43.440 a
00:05:43.650 v-shape

00:05:44.150 and
00:05:45.289 so
00:05:46.289 just
00:05:46.500 go
00:05:46.710 to
00:05:46.770 the

00:06:28.530 make
00:06:29.530 a

00:06:29.560 bit
00:06:29.770 more
00:06:29.920 room

00:06:43.150 and
00:06:43.630 it's
00:06:43.780 very
00:06:43.930 important
00:06:44.440 let's

00:06:54.930 and

00:06:55.930 again
00:06:56.199 generally
00:06:57.190 wouldn't
00:06:57.550 use

00:07:17.420 angle
00:07:17.780 that
00:07:18.710 way
00:07:19.510 which
00:07:20.510 would
00:07:20.780 be

00:07:20.990 towards
00:07:21.770 the
00:07:22.180 top
00:07:23.650 heat

00:08:18.039 these
00:08:18.219 up
00:08:18.429 on

00:08:26.800 belly
00:08:26.979 bit

00:08:29.909 and
00:08:30.909 again
00:08:32.879 we
00:08:33.879 want
00:08:34.120 to
00:08:34.209 run
00:08:34.589 against
00:08:35.589 the

00:08:35.769 grain
00:08:35.979 so
00:08:36.189 tuna
00:08:36.550 over
00:08:37.029 because
00:08:37.959 the
00:08:38.019 grain
00:08:38.229 is

00:08:38.529 running
00:08:38.889 that
00:08:39.009 way
00:08:39.189 and
00:08:40.289 just
00:08:41.289 go
00:08:41.439 like
00:08:41.469 that

00:08:44.370 the
00:08:45.370 spurts
00:08:45.639 generally
00:08:46.269 cut
00:08:46.480 nice
00:08:47.019 and
00:08:47.259 thin

00:08:47.500 and
00:08:47.740 because
00:08:48.730 the
00:08:49.360 belly
00:08:49.569 is
00:08:49.720 a
00:08:49.750 lot
00:08:49.990 chillier

00:08:50.170 than
00:08:50.769 the
00:08:51.430 rest
00:08:51.610 of
00:08:51.699 the
00:08:51.790 fish
00:08:53.759 so
00:08:54.759 the
00:08:54.879 thinner

00:08:55.089 it
00:08:55.240 is
00:08:55.389 a
00:08:56.519 bit
00:08:57.519 of
00:08:57.610 the
00:08:57.670 taste
00:09:03.750 and
00:09:04.750 when

00:09:04.930 cutting
00:09:05.379 sashimi
00:09:05.949 and
00:09:07.230 the
00:09:08.230 Japanese
00:09:09.009 they

00:09:10.170 they
00:09:11.170 cut
00:09:11.379 each
00:09:11.589 individual
00:09:12.490 part
00:09:13.420 of
00:09:13.509 the

00:09:13.660 fish
00:09:14.009 so
00:09:15.009 that
00:09:15.750 each
00:09:16.750 different
00:09:17.649 part
00:09:18.060 is
00:09:19.060 the

00:09:19.300 same
00:09:19.480 texture

00:09:21.070 and
00:09:21.550 feel
00:09:22.000 in
00:09:22.329 the
00:09:23.110 mouth
00:09:23.820 which
00:09:24.820 is
00:09:24.850 why
00:09:25.209 they

00:09:25.660 separate
00:09:26.199 the
00:09:26.709 three
00:09:27.459 different
00:09:27.850 parts
00:09:28.240 of

00:09:28.449 the
00:09:28.720 filler
00:09:29.610 because
00:09:30.610 each
00:09:30.970 one
00:09:31.209 has

00:09:31.360 different
00:09:31.389 grains
00:09:31.959 so
00:09:32.470 it
00:09:32.589 can
00:09:32.740 be
00:09:33.839 cut
00:09:35.399 so

00:09:36.399 that
00:09:36.430 has
00:09:36.730 the
00:09:36.880 same
00:09:37.089 same
00:09:37.630 feel
00:09:37.959 in
00:09:38.290 the
00:09:38.529 mouth

00:09:42.130 and
00:09:42.370 that's
00:09:42.940 how
00:09:43.329 we
00:09:43.389 do
00:09:43.540 sashimi
