00:02:31.519 on
00:02:31.670 hand
00:02:31.879 they
00:02:32.420 would
00:02:32.599 use

00:02:32.750 the
00:02:32.900 stalk
00:02:33.200 as

00:04:34.820 half
00:04:34.970 that
00:04:35.420 will
00:04:35.750 make
00:04:36.020 a
00:04:36.050 difference
00:04:36.530 just

00:04:46.850 little
00:04:47.030 bit
00:04:47.120 more
00:04:47.420 and
00:04:48.200 a
00:04:48.680 honey
00:04:48.860 also
00:04:49.250 really

00:04:49.520 helps
00:04:49.880 thicken
00:04:50.330 the
00:04:50.540 juices
00:04:51.110 like

00:05:04.520 will
00:05:04.610 be
00:05:04.700 time

00:07:01.289 is
00:07:01.319 about
00:07:01.589 right

00:07:01.830 usually
00:07:02.069 get
00:07:02.279 about
00:07:02.399 six
00:07:02.699 out
00:07:02.909 of
00:07:03.119 them
00:07:03.360 if

00:07:03.539 again
00:07:04.289 if

00:07:06.179 get
00:07:06.509 probably
00:07:07.020 eight
00:07:07.259 then

00:07:08.879 is
00:07:09.059 a

00:07:09.089 skewer

00:07:10.050 as
00:07:10.229 much
00:07:10.379 of

00:07:10.679 ticket
00:07:11.490 on

00:07:15.899 it
00:07:16.020 too
00:07:16.379 high

00:07:16.589 because
00:07:16.919 it'll
00:07:17.249 develop
00:07:17.520 too
00:07:17.669 much
00:07:17.789 color

00:07:18.059 before
00:07:18.270 the
00:07:18.449 chicken
00:07:18.719 gets
00:07:18.869 a
00:07:18.959 chance
00:07:19.139 to
00:07:19.379 cook

00:07:27.839 of
00:07:27.899 sticks
00:07:28.139 and
00:07:28.289 develops

00:07:28.649 color
00:07:29.039 then
