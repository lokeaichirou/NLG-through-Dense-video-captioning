00:00:57.600 bit
00:00:57.809 more
00:00:57.989 salty
00:00:58.590 and

00:02:06.630 is
00:02:06.750 cooking
00:02:07.140 you

00:02:08.069 a
00:02:08.280 pan

00:02:09.869 that
00:02:09.989 over
00:02:10.409 medium
00:02:10.890 heat
00:02:11.159 and
00:02:11.370 then
00:02:11.879 add
00:02:12.150 a

00:02:12.540 little
00:02:12.900 bit
00:02:13.109 of
00:02:13.349 olive
00:02:13.650 oil
00:02:14.010 in

00:02:15.510 your
00:02:15.749 chopped
00:02:16.170 pancetta

00:02:17.639 that
00:02:17.849 into

00:02:18.209 the
00:02:18.510 pan
00:02:18.749 now
00:02:19.200 if
00:02:19.650 you're
00:02:19.829 using
00:02:20.129 regular

00:02:20.340 bacon
00:02:21.299 you
00:02:21.480 don't
00:02:21.659 need
00:02:21.810 to
00:02:22.019 use
00:02:22.200 the
00:02:22.499 olive

00:02:22.950 oil
00:02:23.159 I
00:02:23.400 just

00:02:24.239 little
00:02:24.389 bit
00:02:24.810 in

00:02:25.049 the
00:02:25.200 pan
00:02:25.409 with
00:02:25.650 the
00:02:25.739 pancetta
00:02:25.950 because

00:02:26.489 sometimes
00:02:27.150 it
00:02:27.329 doesn't
00:02:27.480 have
00:02:27.689 as
00:02:27.840 much
00:02:27.989 fat
00:02:28.260 as

00:02:28.469 others
00:02:28.799 cook
00:02:29.430 this
00:02:29.639 down
00:02:30.000 until
00:02:30.959 the
00:02:31.260 fat

00:02:31.530 renders
00:02:32.129 and
00:02:32.519 it
00:02:32.609 becomes
00:02:32.939 nice
00:02:33.239 and
00:02:33.569 crispy

00:02:34.139 while
00:02:34.680 my
00:02:34.859 pancetta
00:02:35.099 is
00:02:35.639 cooking
00:02:36.180 and
00:02:36.480 my

00:02:36.599 pasta
00:02:37.139 is
00:02:37.200 boiling
00:02:37.500 away
00:02:37.769 I'm
00:02:38.519 just
00:02:38.790 gonna

00:02:38.909 make
00:02:39.090 the
00:02:39.269 sauce
00:02:39.480 real
00:02:39.810 quick
00:02:40.049 and
00:02:40.260 it's
00:02:40.379 very

00:02:40.650 simple
00:02:41.010 so
00:02:41.609 into
00:02:42.030 a
00:02:42.090 bowl
00:02:42.299 add
00:02:42.540 the
00:02:43.109 eggs
00:02:43.319 and

00:02:44.629 lightly
00:02:45.629 whisk
00:02:46.019 them
00:02:46.349 then
00:02:46.680 take
00:02:47.040 that

00:02:47.340 freshly
00:02:48.030 grated
00:02:48.239 Parmesan
00:02:48.930 cheese
00:02:49.409 and
00:02:49.799 add

00:02:50.219 that
00:02:50.549 in
00:02:52.669 along
00:02:53.669 with
00:02:54.000 several
00:02:54.389 grates
00:02:54.959 of

00:02:55.169 freshly
00:02:55.799 ground
00:02:56.310 black
00:02:56.699 pepper
00:02:56.849 now
00:02:57.840 this
00:02:58.169 is

00:02:58.439 another
00:02:58.829 really
00:02:59.219 important
00:03:00.000 part
00:03:00.209 of
00:03:00.359 the

00:03:00.510 recipe
00:03:00.689 it
00:03:01.260 just
00:03:01.500 really
00:03:01.680 makes
00:03:01.919 a
00:03:02.069 big

00:03:02.280 difference
00:03:02.730 in
00:03:02.909 the
00:03:02.969 way
00:03:03.090 this
00:03:03.299 is
