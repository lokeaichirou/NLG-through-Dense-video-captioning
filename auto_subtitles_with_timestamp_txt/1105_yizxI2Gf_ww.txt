00:03:56.370 lot
00:03:56.610 of

00:03:56.640 bubbles
00:03:57.120 so
00:03:57.540 it

00:03:58.470 puffing
00:03:58.770 up

00:04:13.410 above
00:04:13.800 the
00:04:13.860 flame
00:04:14.340 so
00:04:14.670 it
00:04:14.700 doesn't
00:04:15.150 burn

00:04:15.390 but
00:04:16.320 pops
00:04:16.709 up
00:04:16.980 right
