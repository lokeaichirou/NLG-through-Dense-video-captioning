00:00:19.900 couple
00:00:19.990 of

00:00:20.410 Idaho
00:00:20.860 russets
00:00:21.400 that
00:00:21.670 I've
00:00:21.789 peeled
00:00:22.210 and

00:00:22.600 cooked

00:00:28.840 stovetop

00:00:29.140 too
00:00:29.710 just
00:00:30.130 like
00:00:30.310 you
00:00:30.460 would
00:00:30.640 if
00:00:30.820 you
00:00:30.910 were

00:00:30.940 making
00:00:31.240 mashed
00:00:31.660 potatoes
00:00:32.259 this
00:00:32.770 crazy
00:00:33.250 fun

00:00:33.640 idea
00:00:33.969 was
00:00:34.239 developed
00:00:34.780 by
00:00:34.989 Erika
00:00:35.530 of

00:00:35.980 Erika's
00:00:36.489 kitchen
00:00:36.940 there
00:00:37.690 that
00:00:38.379 looks
00:00:38.620 about

00:00:38.800 right
00:00:38.949 I'm
00:00:39.429 going
00:00:39.879 to
00:00:39.909 make
00:00:40.089 two
00:00:40.420 different

00:00:40.449 kinds
00:00:41.050 of
00:00:41.109 pops
00:00:41.409 so
00:00:41.859 I'm
00:00:41.979 dividing
00:00:42.159 the
00:00:42.579 mashed

00:00:42.789 potatoes
00:00:43.329 like
00:00:44.019 so
00:00:44.559 don't
00:00:45.429 be
00:00:45.670 shy
00:00:45.999 this
00:00:46.569 is

00:00:46.749 pepper
00:00:47.019 jack
00:00:47.379 cheese
00:00:47.579 bacon
00:00:48.579 bits
00:00:49.210 get
00:00:50.050 this

00:00:50.319 good
00:00:50.679 and
00:00:50.949 combined
00:00:51.399 and
00:00:51.909 if
00:00:52.149 you
00:00:52.269 haven't

00:00:52.510 guessed
00:00:52.870 yet
00:00:53.050 this
00:00:53.679 is
00:00:53.979 going
00:00:54.309 to
00:00:54.429 be
00:00:54.549 a

00:00:54.579 jalapeno
00:00:55.420 popper
00:00:55.929 pop
00:00:56.170 I
00:00:56.409 know
00:00:56.469 it's
00:00:56.859 tempting

00:00:58.239 the
00:00:58.359 cheese
00:00:58.600 and
00:00:58.870 bacon

00:00:59.049 but
00:00:59.559 you
00:00:59.649 need
00:00:59.829 a
00:00:59.859 good
00:01:00.069 ratio
00:01:00.339 so
00:01:00.940 your
00:01:01.089 pops

00:01:01.359 stay
00:01:01.719 together
00:01:02.139 and
00:01:02.530 there
00:01:03.399 that's
00:01:03.819 about
00:01:04.120 the

00:01:04.390 texture
00:01:04.720 you
00:01:04.960 want

00:01:16.829 here's
00:01:17.829 my
00:01:18.039 jalapeno

00:01:18.700 popper
00:01:19.119 pop
00:01:19.359 mixture
00:01:19.990 I've

00:01:22.539 filling
00:01:23.020 it
00:01:23.140 just

00:01:23.530 to
00:01:23.710 the
00:01:23.740 top
00:01:24.039 don't
00:01:24.609 go
00:01:24.789 crazy
00:01:25.119 with
00:01:25.509 a
00:01:25.539 heaping

00:01:26.020 tablespoon
00:01:26.680 or
00:01:26.890 your
00:01:27.009 pop
00:01:27.250 will
00:01:27.520 be
00:01:27.640 too
00:01:27.850 big

00:01:28.060 to
00:01:28.090 fit
00:01:28.420 in
00:01:28.509 your
00:01:28.630 piehole
00:01:28.979 remember
00:01:29.979 you

00:01:30.340 shouldn't
00:01:30.700 have
00:01:30.820 to
00:01:30.969 rely
00:01:31.119 on
00:01:31.299 magic
00:01:31.869 to
00:01:32.020 eat

00:01:32.289 the
00:01:32.500 Pops
00:01:32.740 roll
00:01:33.429 the
00:01:33.609 mixture
00:01:34.030 into
00:01:34.240 a
00:01:34.359 ball

00:01:34.659 easy
00:01:35.289 enough
00:01:35.710 right
00:01:35.979 continue
00:01:36.939 doing
00:01:37.240 this

00:01:37.390 until
00:01:37.450 you
00:01:37.780 have
00:01:37.990 all
00:01:38.259 the
00:01:38.439 mixture
00:01:38.770 rolled

00:01:39.130 into
00:01:39.340 balls
00:01:39.609 I'm
00:01:40.060 going
00:01:40.119 to
00:01:40.659 do
00:01:40.869 the
00:01:41.020 same

00:01:41.289 thing
00:01:41.679 with
00:01:41.950 the
00:01:42.070 garlic
00:01:42.250 parmesan
00:01:42.789 mixture

00:01:43.479 Idaho
00:01:44.229 russets
00:01:44.710 are
00:01:44.859 really
00:01:45.189 good
00:01:45.369 for

00:01:46.420 lower
00:01:46.719 moisture

00:01:47.020 content

00:01:48.189 the
00:01:48.340 mixture
00:01:48.670 sticks
00:01:49.090 together

00:01:55.270 for
00:01:55.570 safekeeping
00:01:55.810 and
