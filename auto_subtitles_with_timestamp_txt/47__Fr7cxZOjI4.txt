00:00:15.780 version
00:00:15.990 with

00:00:16.560 ground
00:00:17.039 pork
00:00:17.460 start
00:00:18.180 off
00:00:18.300 by
00:00:18.510 mincing
00:00:19.020 one

00:00:19.529 sort
00:00:19.859 of
00:00:19.920 large
00:00:20.430 clove
00:00:20.970 of
00:00:21.210 garlic

00:00:22.920 tablespoon
00:00:23.730 of
00:00:23.939 ginger
00:00:24.359 or
00:00:24.930 make
00:00:25.080 sure
00:00:25.289 that

00:00:25.439 you
00:00:25.560 peel
00:00:25.890 it
00:00:25.920 first
00:00:26.369 and
00:00:26.789 then
00:00:27.240 very
00:00:27.570 thinly

00:00:27.960 slice
00:00:28.410 it
00:00:28.439 across
00:00:29.420 you

00:00:33.210 is
00:00:33.570 much
00:00:33.809 greater
00:00:34.350 than
00:00:34.770 when
00:00:35.100 you

00:00:35.250 grate
00:00:35.489 it
00:00:35.520 and

00:00:37.200 mind
00:00:37.440 little
00:00:38.250 pieces

00:00:38.489 of
00:00:38.700 ginger

00:00:42.059 it
00:00:42.180 into
00:00:42.329 little
00:00:42.629 thin

00:00:43.079 strips
00:00:43.530 and
00:00:43.770 then
00:00:44.250 cut
00:00:44.309 crosswise
00:00:44.910 those

00:00:45.539 strips

00:00:48.210 little
00:00:48.480 bit
00:00:48.570 of
00:00:48.780 egg

00:00:51.180 two

00:00:51.570 eggs
00:00:53.090 whisk
00:00:54.090 them
00:00:54.420 these

00:00:55.350 just
00:00:55.620 a
00:00:55.800 little

00:00:56.370 bit
00:00:56.520 of
00:00:56.640 soy
00:00:56.789 sauce
00:00:56.850 about
00:00:57.390 a
00:00:57.420 quarter
00:00:57.870 of
00:00:57.899 a

00:00:58.050 teaspoon

00:00:59.039 place
00:00:59.280 of
00:00:59.609 salt
00:00:59.940 though

00:01:00.420 I
00:01:00.449 do
00:01:00.600 find
00:01:00.960 that
00:01:01.109 sometimes
00:01:01.350 you
00:01:01.649 want

00:01:03.120 fried
00:01:03.480 rice

00:01:03.690 anyway
00:01:04.229 because
00:01:04.700 soy
00:01:05.700 sauce
00:01:05.970 while
00:01:06.180 it's

00:01:06.330 salty
00:01:06.689 it
00:01:06.810 doesn't
00:01:07.140 enhance
00:01:07.619 the
00:01:07.770 flavors
00:01:08.130 in

00:01:08.430 quite

00:02:36.670 through
00:02:37.000 but
00:02:37.420 this
00:02:37.600 pork
00:02:37.900 needs

00:02:38.080 to

00:02:38.410 cooked

00:02:40.849 when
