00:02:08.780 fine

00:02:10.440 after

00:02:11.370 has
00:02:11.430 been

00:02:11.880 an

00:02:12.000 hour
00:02:12.120 I

00:02:12.990 doneness
00:02:13.140 what
00:02:13.710 I

00:02:13.740 like
00:02:14.010 to

00:02:22.980 sugar
00:02:23.220 too
00:02:23.460 early
00:02:23.760 because
00:02:23.940 the
00:02:24.120 sugar
00:02:24.390 can

00:02:24.600 pull
00:02:24.750 the
00:02:24.840 moisture
00:02:25.200 out
00:02:25.260 and

00:02:27.840 dissolve

00:02:27.870 the
00:02:28.320 sugar

00:02:28.770 I
00:02:28.800 want
00:02:29.430 to
00:02:29.520 cool
00:02:29.700 it
00:02:29.820 in
00:02:29.970 the
00:02:30.240 liquid

00:02:30.810 it

00:02:30.900 stays
00:02:31.110 moist
00:02:31.440 and
00:02:31.710 succulent

00:02:41.130 the
00:02:41.160 very
00:02:41.430 end

00:02:41.760 now
