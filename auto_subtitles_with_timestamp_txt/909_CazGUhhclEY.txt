00:02:30.650 on
00:02:30.770 a

00:02:30.800 burger
00:02:31.220 I
00:02:31.400 cannot
00:02:31.670 wait
00:02:31.910 for

00:02:34.070 101
00:02:34.550 but

00:02:34.820 it's
00:02:34.940 one
00:02:35.300 of
00:02:35.390 the
00:02:35.480 biggest
00:02:35.840 mistakes
00:02:36.260 I
00:02:36.440 see

00:02:36.470 grillers
00:02:38.350 encounter
00:02:39.350 is
00:02:39.500 when
00:02:39.680 they
00:02:39.800 make
00:02:39.830 a

00:02:40.340 hamburger
00:02:41.090 because
00:02:41.630 it
00:02:41.930 usually
00:02:42.320 ends
00:02:42.440 up

00:02:42.620 shrinking
00:02:43.100 a
00:02:43.160 meatball
00:02:43.370 instead
00:02:44.270 of
00:02:44.360 being
00:02:44.600 a

00:02:44.810 good
00:02:45.050 hamburger
00:02:45.320 so
00:02:45.739 let
00:02:45.860 me
00:02:45.950 show
00:02:46.100 you

00:02:46.190 something
00:02:46.550 first
00:02:46.700 of
00:02:46.910 all
00:02:47.000 the
00:02:47.120 quality
00:02:47.510 of

00:02:47.570 the
00:02:47.660 beef
00:02:47.810 is
00:02:47.959 very
00:02:48.140 important
00:02:48.640 this
00:02:49.640 is
00:02:49.820 from

00:02:49.970 a
00:02:50.000 local
00:02:50.120 butcher
00:02:50.480 while
00:02:50.900 the
00:02:51.080 product
00:02:51.290 is

00:02:51.530 local
00:02:51.920 in
00:02:52.430 it's
00:02:52.610 an
00:02:52.700 80/20
00:02:53.360 leanness
00:02:54.050 so

00:02:54.230 there's
00:02:54.410 20%
00:02:55.040 fat
00:02:55.280 80%
00:02:56.180 meat
00:02:56.530 you
00:02:57.530 don't
00:02:57.560 want

00:02:57.890 anything
00:02:58.070 more
00:02:58.340 lean
00:02:58.580 than
00:02:58.760 that
00:02:58.910 because

00:02:59.239 then
00:02:59.420 it
00:02:59.510 won't
00:02:59.600 hold
00:02:59.840 together
00:03:00.220 when
00:03:01.220 you're

00:03:01.340 grilling
00:03:01.489 it
00:03:01.790 and
00:03:01.970 it
00:03:02.060 won't
00:03:02.239 have
00:03:02.390 much

00:03:02.600 flavor
00:03:03.170 and
00:03:03.950 since
00:03:04.220 this
00:03:04.340 is
00:03:04.489 really
00:03:04.520 good
00:03:04.910 be

00:03:05.060 from
00:03:05.300 we're
00:03:05.390 gonna
00:03:05.450 have
00:03:05.600 a
00:03:05.660 really
00:03:05.840 nice
00:03:06.080 blue

00:03:06.440 cheese
00:03:06.650 spread
00:03:07.010 on
00:03:07.160 it
00:03:07.310 we're
00:03:08.000 just
00:03:08.030 gonna

00:03:08.180 salt
00:03:08.540 and
00:03:08.600 pepper
00:03:08.690 these
00:03:09.020 we're
00:03:09.260 not
00:03:09.380 going
00:03:09.500 to

00:03:09.560 get

00:03:10.640 rubber
00:03:10.790 or

00:03:10.940 anything
00:03:11.090 so
00:03:11.570 anyway
00:03:11.930 you
00:03:12.500 take
00:03:12.709 the
00:03:12.920 animal

00:03:13.880 burger
00:03:14.090 about

00:03:20.450 looseness
00:03:20.840 to
00:03:21.080 it
00:03:21.380 but
00:03:21.890 you
00:03:21.980 just
00:03:22.300 flatten
00:03:23.300 it

00:03:23.390 out
00:03:23.450 this

00:03:40.850 the
00:03:40.940 middle
00:03:41.209 where

00:03:41.570 it's
00:03:41.750 thinner
00:03:42.019 than
00:03:42.430 the
00:03:43.430 outside
00:03:44.140 portion
00:03:45.140 of

00:03:45.380 the
00:03:45.530 burger
00:03:45.709 and
00:03:46.010 the
00:03:46.190 reason
00:03:46.580 is
00:03:47.450 when
00:03:47.690 you

00:03:47.780 grill
00:03:48.050 that
00:03:48.230 it
00:03:48.560 has
00:03:48.800 a
00:03:48.830 tendency
00:03:49.100 to
00:03:49.400 pull

00:03:49.610 together
00:03:49.840 so
00:03:50.840 if
00:03:50.960 you've
00:03:51.080 already

00:03:52.100 this
00:03:52.370 thin
00:03:52.670 you'll
00:03:53.210 come
00:03:53.420 out
00:03:53.480 with
00:03:53.540 an
00:03:53.780 even

00:03:53.960 burner
00:03:54.290 instead
00:03:54.650 of
00:03:54.740 a
00:03:54.830 big
00:03:55.040 meatball
00:03:55.280 so

00:03:55.940 that's
00:03:56.090 just
00:03:56.210 a
00:03:56.330 little
00:03:56.570 secret
00:03:57.070 for
00:03:58.070 how
00:03:58.190 you

00:03:58.250 do
00:03:58.460 it
00:03:58.580 then
00:03:58.730 you
00:03:58.820 just
00:03:59.030 hit
00:03:59.120 it
00:03:59.180 with
00:03:59.270 a
00:03:59.360 little

00:03:59.540 salt
00:03:59.870 a
00:04:00.140 little
00:04:00.430 salt
00:04:01.430 a
00:04:01.730 little
00:04:01.760 pepper

00:04:02.590 gorilla
00:04:03.590 try
00:04:03.890 to
00:04:03.950 turn
00:04:04.220 it
00:04:04.370 just
00:04:04.580 two
00:04:05.180 or
00:04:05.300 three
