00:00:45.469 gluten
00:00:45.829 content

00:00:46.129 makes
00:00:46.760 the
00:00:46.909 bread
00:00:47.149 really
00:00:47.510 really
00:00:48.050 soft

00:00:48.319 spongy
00:00:48.800 absolute
00:00:49.069 perfect
00:00:49.370 goes
00:00:49.489 into
00:00:49.670 our

00:00:49.699 machine
00:00:49.850 you

00:00:53.239 out
00:00:53.420 of

00:00:53.749 good
00:00:54.219 another
00:00:55.219 thing
00:00:55.460 that
00:00:55.579 makes
00:00:55.670 bread
00:00:55.909 rise

00:00:56.120 is
00:00:56.420 yeast
00:00:56.749 so
00:00:56.960 we've
00:00:57.079 got
00:00:57.229 droid
00:00:57.620 active
00:00:58.249 yeast

00:00:58.519 and
00:00:59.149 we
00:00:59.269 need
00:00:59.389 to
00:00:59.510 do
00:00:59.600 pop
00:00:59.929 that
00:01:00.170 into
00:01:00.440 a
00:01:00.589 little

00:01:00.649 bit
00:01:00.829 of
00:01:00.889 water
00:01:01.039 just
00:01:01.870 to
00:01:02.870 begin
00:01:03.019 to
00:01:03.530 activate

00:01:04.010 it
00:01:04.280 that
00:01:04.610 just
00:01:04.850 room-temperature
00:01:05.330 water

00:01:05.840 yeah
00:01:06.230 kind
00:01:06.500 of
00:01:06.530 body
00:01:06.710 temperature
00:01:06.950 it's
00:01:07.400 like

00:01:07.520 too
00:01:07.700 hot
00:01:07.910 it
00:01:08.030 will
00:01:08.060 kill
00:01:08.270 the
00:01:08.300 yeast
00:01:08.420 too
00:01:09.200 cold

00:01:09.500 it
00:01:09.680 just
00:01:09.860 take
00:01:10.070 longer
00:01:10.250 and
00:01:10.670 then
00:01:10.880 season
00:01:11.420 your

00:01:11.510 bread
00:01:11.690 we
00:01:11.900 are
00:01:12.020 going
00:01:12.260 so
00:01:12.590 based
00:01:12.830 this
00:01:13.010 is
00:01:13.100 a

00:01:13.130 wet
00:01:13.370 glue
00:01:13.580 yep
00:01:14.060 so
00:01:14.270 about
00:01:14.450 a
00:01:14.510 teaspoon
00:01:14.690 of
00:01:14.990 salt

00:01:15.350 into
00:01:15.590 there
00:01:15.770 don't
00:01:16.400 add
00:01:16.550 it
00:01:16.670 into
00:01:16.760 the
00:01:16.880 yeast

00:01:17.180 because
00:01:17.330 it
00:01:17.510 has
00:01:17.630 a
00:01:17.660 tendency
00:01:18.200 to
00:01:18.440 store

00:01:18.820 denature
00:01:19.820 the
00:01:19.940 yeast
00:01:20.240 because
00:01:20.510 of
00:01:20.720 its
00:01:20.840 a
00:01:20.900 pH

00:01:21.140 levels
00:01:21.590 basically
00:01:22.250 but
00:01:22.640 to
00:01:22.790 sciency
00:01:23.240 all
00:01:23.570 you

00:01:23.630 need
00:01:23.750 to
00:01:23.840 know
00:01:23.960 is
00:01:24.110 keep
00:01:24.440 the
00:01:24.560 salt
00:01:24.860 separate

00:01:25.580 from
00:01:25.730 the
00:01:25.820 yeast
00:01:25.970 nothing
00:01:26.390 you've
00:01:26.510 ever
00:01:26.690 done

00:01:26.990 is
00:01:27.200 in
00:01:27.410 between
00:01:27.500 science
00:01:28.130 right
00:01:28.910 clamp
00:01:29.540 it

00:01:29.660 down
00:01:30.040 switch
00:01:31.040 it
00:01:31.160 on
00:01:31.280 and
00:01:31.460 then
00:01:31.640 pour
00:01:31.970 in
00:01:32.120 this

00:01:32.240 you
00:01:32.360 may
00:01:32.480 not
00:01:32.600 need
00:01:32.690 all
00:01:32.840 of
00:01:32.870 it
00:01:33.050 so
00:01:33.290 go
00:01:33.470 sort
00:01:33.800 of

00:01:33.860 7/8
00:01:34.340 leave
00:01:34.640 a
00:01:34.670 little
00:01:34.850 bit
00:01:35.060 back
00:01:36.370 bit
00:01:37.370 more

00:01:37.720 perfectly
00:01:38.720 you
00:01:38.870 can
00:01:38.900 do
00:01:39.230 this
00:01:39.320 by
00:01:39.470 hand
00:01:39.680 but

00:01:39.950 ideally
00:01:40.400 in
00:01:40.880 the
00:01:40.940 machine
00:01:41.360 it
00:01:41.570 needs
00:01:41.750 about
00:01:41.870 5

00:01:42.260 minutes
00:01:42.560 of
00:01:42.770 kneading
00:01:42.950 until
00:01:43.250 it's
00:01:43.550 soft
00:01:43.910 and

00:01:44.180 elastic
00:01:44.270 it's
00:01:45.140 doing
00:01:45.350 by
00:01:45.440 hand
00:01:45.740 it
00:01:46.040 might

00:01:46.479 ten
00:01:47.020 minutes
00:01:47.320 just
00:01:47.590 the
00:01:47.860 way
00:01:47.950 you
00:01:48.009 work
00:01:48.250 it

00:01:48.430 okay
00:01:48.759 okay
00:01:49.119 at
00:01:49.479 this
00:01:49.630 point
00:01:49.869 it
00:01:49.930 hasn't
00:01:50.229 quite

00:01:50.380 all
00:01:50.650 come
00:01:50.830 back
00:01:50.860 together
00:01:51.159 so
00:01:51.610 dribble
00:01:51.939 a

00:01:52.000 little
00:01:52.270 bit
00:01:52.360 more
00:01:52.540 liquid
00:01:52.869 in
00:01:53.140 you
00:01:53.560 can't
00:01:53.830 take

00:01:54.009 out
00:01:54.189 so
00:01:54.430 it's
00:01:54.549 best
00:01:54.700 to
00:01:54.790 hold
00:01:54.939 them
00:01:55.180 back
00:01:55.330 and

00:01:55.540 had
00:01:55.659 it
00:01:55.750 more
00:01:55.899 if
00:01:55.960 you
00:01:56.049 need
00:01:56.290 it
00:01:56.470 every
00:01:56.680 flower

00:01:57.189 behaves
00:01:57.549 slightly
00:01:57.729 differently
00:01:58.450 speed
00:01:59.170 it
00:01:59.290 up

00:01:59.320 get
00:01:59.680 some
00:01:59.710 elbow
00:02:00.070 grease
00:02:00.100 in
00:02:00.430 there
00:02:01.320 there
00:02:02.320 we

00:02:02.380 go
00:02:02.470 just
00:02:02.500 which
00:02:02.830 it
00:02:02.950 off
00:02:04.979 lifts
00:02:05.979 up
00:02:06.220 and
00:02:06.700 this

00:02:07.360 is
00:02:07.420 the
00:02:07.570 kind
00:02:07.869 of
00:02:07.960 elastic
00:02:08.289 though
00:02:08.770 we
00:02:08.890 want
00:02:09.100 it

00:02:09.220 just
00:02:09.369 slide
00:02:09.759 off
00:02:10.119 the
00:02:10.239 dough
00:02:10.390 hook
00:02:10.830 if
00:02:11.830 you

00:02:11.890 pick
00:02:12.069 it
00:02:12.160 up
00:02:12.310 a
00:02:12.519 little
00:02:12.790 bit
00:02:12.910 of
00:02:13.000 flour
00:02:13.180 if
00:02:13.480 you

00:02:13.510 find
00:02:13.810 too
00:02:14.019 sticky
00:02:14.319 is
00:02:14.650 a
00:02:14.709 little
00:02:15.040 bit
00:02:15.160 sticky

00:02:15.390 just
00:02:16.390 so
00:02:16.510 you
00:02:16.569 can
00:02:16.750 handle
00:02:17.080 it

00:02:17.410 I
00:02:17.670 wouldn't
00:02:18.670 have
00:02:18.760 a
00:02:18.790 feel
00:02:19.030 of
00:02:19.180 this
00:02:19.300 because
00:02:19.360 I

00:02:19.660 want
00:02:19.870 to
00:02:19.959 okay
00:02:20.830 so
00:02:21.670 is
00:02:21.970 that
00:02:22.209 sort
00:02:22.420 of
00:02:22.510 like

00:02:22.600 elastic
00:02:23.110 II
00:02:23.440 stretchy
