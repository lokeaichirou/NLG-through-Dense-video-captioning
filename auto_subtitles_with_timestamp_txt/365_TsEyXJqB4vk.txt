00:00:55.559 was
00:00:56.340 shocked
00:00:56.610 that
00:00:56.699 I
00:00:56.850 saw
00:00:57.090 the

00:00:57.149 potential
00:00:57.660 in
00:00:57.930 the
00:00:58.020 chicken
00:00:58.289 meatball
00:00:58.590 went

00:00:59.820 good
00:01:00.030 really

00:01:01.710 like
00:01:01.800 I
00:01:01.890 saw
00:01:02.129 the

00:01:02.190 potential
00:01:02.760 how
00:01:03.120 they
00:01:03.359 come
00:01:03.690 on

00:01:05.430 I
00:01:05.610 realized
00:01:05.850 how
00:01:06.210 incredible

00:01:06.720 this
00:01:07.260 could
00:01:07.500 be
00:01:07.619 so
00:01:07.830 start
00:01:08.040 making
00:01:08.220 chicken

00:01:08.400 meatball

00:05:41.570 of

00:05:41.720 extra
00:05:41.990 salt
00:05:42.290 the
00:05:42.500 soy
00:05:42.710 is
00:05:42.890 salty
00:05:43.370 but
00:05:43.880 we're
