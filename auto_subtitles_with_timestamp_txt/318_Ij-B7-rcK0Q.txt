00:00:51.350 up
00:00:51.470 to
00:00:51.500 the

00:00:51.650 boil
00:00:51.920 now
00:00:52.160 they
00:00:52.340 need
00:00:52.550 to
00:00:52.670 cook
00:00:52.850 for
00:00:53.120 about
00:00:53.210 15

00:00:53.930 minutes
00:00:54.140 or
00:00:54.379 until
00:00:54.440 the
00:00:54.860 potatoes
00:00:55.250 are
00:00:55.280 nice

00:00:55.850 and
00:00:56.059 tender

00:00:58.530 now
00:00:59.530 when
00:00:59.680 you
00:00:59.770 take
00:00:59.920 a
00:00:59.980 knife
00:01:00.340 and
00:01:00.520 you
00:01:00.700 push

00:01:00.940 it
00:01:00.970 into
00:01:01.330 the
00:01:01.510 potato
00:01:01.720 and
00:01:02.230 it
00:01:02.320 goes
00:01:02.560 through

00:01:02.860 without
00:01:03.100 any
00:01:03.160 resistance
00:01:03.640 you
00:01:04.270 know
00:01:04.449 your

00:01:04.629 potatoes
00:01:05.020 are
00:01:05.199 ready
00:01:05.470 to
00:01:05.740 mash
00:01:06.360 so
00:01:07.360 I
00:01:07.390 bring
00:01:07.570 my

00:01:07.630 saucepan
00:01:08.200 over
00:01:08.410 to
00:01:08.680 the
00:01:08.800 sink
00:01:09.040 and
00:01:09.280 just

00:01:09.550 holding
00:01:09.910 the
00:01:10.030 lid
00:01:10.180 on
00:01:10.300 at
00:01:10.510 an
00:01:10.630 angle
00:01:10.990 we
00:01:11.110 should

00:01:11.230 just
00:01:11.410 pour
00:01:11.680 out
00:01:11.890 the
00:01:12.550 hot
00:01:12.730 water
00:01:13.000 now
00:01:13.930 if
00:01:14.020 you

00:01:14.140 take
00:01:14.290 your
00:01:14.470 meshes
00:01:14.830 straight
00:01:15.100 away
00:01:15.280 and
00:01:15.490 try

00:01:15.670 to
00:01:15.729 mesh
00:01:16.060 those
00:01:16.300 potatoes
00:01:16.780 they'll
00:01:16.960 be
00:01:17.170 a

00:01:17.200 little
00:01:17.470 bit
00:01:17.680 dry
00:01:17.950 so
00:01:18.280 to
00:01:18.910 make
00:01:19.150 our
00:01:19.330 mashed

00:01:19.540 potato
00:01:19.900 a
00:01:19.990 little
00:01:20.260 smoother
00:01:20.590 I'm
00:01:20.710 just
00:01:20.890 going

00:01:21.010 to
00:01:21.040 add
00:01:21.190 a
00:01:21.220 knob
00:01:21.550 of
00:01:21.700 butter
00:01:21.880 into
00:01:22.180 there
00:01:22.479 and
00:01:22.780 a

00:01:23.050 splash
00:01:23.380 or
00:01:23.590 so
00:01:23.800 of
00:01:24.040 full
00:01:24.310 cream
00:01:24.460 milk
00:01:24.660 and
00:01:25.660 now

00:01:25.840 that's
00:01:26.050 a
00:01:26.170 lot
00:01:26.410 easier
00:01:26.830 to
00:01:26.979 mash
00:01:27.160 up
00:01:27.310 to
00:01:27.490 a

00:01:27.520 smooth
00:01:27.970 mashed
00:01:28.300 potato
00:01:28.710 so
00:01:29.710 now
00:01:29.860 our
00:01:29.890 mash
00:01:30.220 is

00:01:30.430 ready
00:01:30.700 we're
00:01:30.970 just
00:01:31.150 set
00:01:31.360 that
00:01:31.540 aside
00:01:31.660 and
00:01:32.110 get

00:01:32.259 on
00:01:32.410 and
00:01:32.590 prepare
00:01:32.740 the
00:01:33.070 colcannon
00:01:33.540 now

00:01:34.540 traditionally
00:01:35.110 cabbage
00:01:35.590 or
00:01:35.860 kale
00:01:36.160 is
00:01:36.400 used

00:01:36.610 but
00:01:36.790 I
00:01:36.880 really
00:01:37.180 think
00:01:37.330 kale
00:01:37.630 is
00:01:37.840 the
00:01:37.960 best
00:01:38.170 and

00:01:38.350 I've
00:01:38.890 got
00:01:39.070 my
00:01:39.190 kale
00:01:39.400 here
00:01:39.700 we
00:01:39.880 just
00:01:40.030 want
00:01:40.150 to

00:01:40.450 pull
00:01:40.690 the
00:01:40.900 leaves
00:01:41.080 off
00:01:41.290 the
00:01:41.530 side
00:01:41.770 we
00:01:42.550 don't

00:01:42.729 want
00:01:42.850 the
00:01:42.910 stalks
00:01:43.210 because
00:01:43.600 they're
00:01:43.780 a
00:01:43.810 little

00:01:44.110 bit
00:01:44.229 tough
00:01:44.670 now
00:01:45.670 once
00:01:45.880 it's
00:01:46.060 off
00:01:46.210 the
00:01:46.360 stalks

00:01:46.660 we're
00:01:46.900 just
00:01:47.050 going
00:01:47.229 to
00:01:47.350 take
00:01:47.560 a
00:01:47.590 knife
00:01:47.950 and

00:01:48.130 roughly
00:01:49.090 chop
00:01:49.750 this
00:01:49.899 up
00:01:50.110 it
00:01:50.259 doesn't
00:01:50.440 have
00:01:50.680 to

00:01:50.830 be
00:01:50.950 too
00:01:51.399 accurate
00:01:51.580 we're
00:01:52.210 just
00:01:52.360 going
00:01:52.570 to

00:01:52.690 break
00:01:52.899 it
00:01:53.050 into
00:01:53.140 smaller
00:01:53.590 pieces
00:01:53.710 and
00:01:54.250 then
00:01:55.149 we

00:01:55.270 can
00:01:55.450 lift
00:01:55.600 those
00:01:55.869 and
00:01:56.170 put
00:01:56.350 them
00:01:56.470 into
00:01:56.619 a
00:01:56.800 large

00:01:57.399 saucepan
00:01:58.200 and
00:01:59.200 now
00:01:59.410 I'm
00:01:59.530 going
00:01:59.619 to
00:01:59.680 put
00:01:59.830 water

00:02:00.100 into
00:02:00.460 this
00:02:00.550 pot
00:02:00.790 probably
00:02:01.119 only
00:02:01.240 about
00:02:01.330 an

00:02:01.690 inch
00:02:01.780 and
00:02:02.140 we're
00:02:02.229 going
00:02:02.350 to
00:02:02.380 bring
00:02:02.590 that
00:02:02.710 up
00:02:02.770 to

00:02:03.009 the
00:02:03.039 boil
00:02:03.280 and
00:02:03.580 then
00:02:03.670 simmer
00:02:03.729 it
00:02:04.179 for
00:02:04.210 about

00:02:04.450 five
00:02:04.960 minutes
00:02:05.200 that
00:02:05.560 should
00:02:05.770 allow
00:02:06.160 the
00:02:06.550 kale

00:02:06.819 to
00:02:06.850 wilt
00:02:07.360 down
00:02:07.450 and
00:02:07.990 just
00:02:08.590 one
00:02:08.740 last
00:02:09.009 little

00:02:09.160 point
00:02:09.520 whilst
00:02:10.000 that
00:02:10.240 comes
00:02:10.479 up
00:02:10.600 to
00:02:10.630 the
00:02:10.810 boil

00:02:10.990 I'm
00:02:11.290 just
00:02:11.470 going
00:02:11.620 to
00:02:11.650 season
00:02:11.950 that
00:02:12.160 with
00:02:12.460 a

00:02:12.490 little
00:02:12.880 bit
00:02:13.000 of
00:02:13.030 salt
00:02:13.360 so
00:02:13.840 whilst
00:02:14.050 our
00:02:14.230 kale
00:02:14.470 is

00:02:14.650 on
00:02:14.770 to
00:02:14.980 a
00:02:15.010 boil
00:02:15.220 I'm
00:02:15.430 just
00:02:15.670 going
00:02:15.790 to
00:02:15.850 take

00:02:16.060 three
00:02:16.300 onions
00:02:16.450 here
00:02:16.840 I'll
00:02:16.990 just
00:02:17.020 cut
00:02:17.410 the
00:02:17.530 tops

00:02:17.709 off
00:02:17.860 and
00:02:18.100 then
00:02:18.550 we're
00:02:18.640 going
00:02:18.730 to
00:02:18.819 finely
00:02:19.209 slice

00:02:19.480 these
00:02:19.720 up
00:02:22.860 so
00:02:23.860 we
00:02:23.980 have
00:02:24.100 three
00:02:24.340 spring
00:02:24.640 onions

00:02:24.940 they're
00:02:25.150 finely
00:02:25.720 diced
00:02:26.100 then
00:02:27.100 I've
00:02:27.220 got
00:02:27.370 a

00:02:27.400 small
00:02:27.730 saucepan
00:02:28.030 here
00:02:28.450 and
00:02:28.600 I've
