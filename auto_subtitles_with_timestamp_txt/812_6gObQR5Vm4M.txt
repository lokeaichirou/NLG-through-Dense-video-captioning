00:03:00.489 sauerkraut
00:03:00.819 process
00:03:01.600 so
00:03:01.989 I'm
00:03:02.950 gonna
00:03:03.100 go
00:03:03.310 ahead

00:03:03.579 and
00:03:03.730 cut
00:03:04.239 this
00:03:04.359 up
00:03:08.700 okay
00:03:09.700 so
00:03:09.760 we
00:03:10.510 have
00:03:10.750 the

00:03:11.350 cabbage
00:03:11.769 all
00:03:12.069 shredded
00:03:12.519 up
00:03:12.730 here
00:03:13.150 into
00:03:13.420 nice

00:03:14.109 thin
00:03:14.680 slices
00:03:15.420 just
00:03:16.420 how
00:03:16.690 I
00:03:16.720 wanted
00:03:17.109 them
00:03:17.290 and

00:03:18.239 you'll
00:03:19.239 see
00:03:19.540 that
00:03:19.780 this
00:03:19.930 takes
00:03:20.319 up
00:03:20.560 pretty

00:03:20.829 much
00:03:20.980 the
00:03:21.160 whole
00:03:21.340 bowl
00:03:21.639 right
00:03:21.910 now
00:03:21.940 but
00:03:22.329 what

00:03:22.480 we'll
00:03:22.630 do
00:03:22.840 next
00:03:23.049 is
00:03:23.470 add
00:03:23.650 our
00:03:23.680 caraway
00:03:24.370 seeds

00:03:24.730 and
00:03:25.120 our
00:03:25.269 salt
00:03:25.599 and
00:03:26.049 we'll
00:03:26.799 mix
00:03:26.980 that
00:03:27.220 in
00:03:27.430 and

00:03:27.760 then
00:03:28.120 we'll
00:03:28.450 let
00:03:28.599 it
00:03:28.630 sit
00:03:29.049 for
00:03:29.370 like
00:03:30.370 thirty

00:03:30.730 minutes
00:03:31.090 to
00:03:31.209 an
00:03:31.329 hour
00:03:31.450 and
00:03:32.019 what
00:03:32.410 will
00:03:32.590 happen

00:03:32.739 is
00:03:33.099 that
00:03:33.280 the
00:03:33.400 cabbage
00:03:33.790 will
00:03:33.970 begin
00:03:34.209 to
00:03:34.450 wilt

00:03:34.750 because
00:03:35.680 both
00:03:35.950 the
00:03:36.130 caraway
00:03:36.489 seeds
00:03:36.880 and
00:03:37.359 the

00:03:37.750 salt
00:03:38.019 help
00:03:39.010 to
00:03:39.250 draw
00:03:39.519 out
00:03:39.849 the
00:03:39.880 moisture
00:03:40.209 from

00:03:40.870 the
00:03:41.019 cabbage
00:03:41.440 and
00:03:41.859 then
00:03:42.250 at
00:03:42.549 that
00:03:42.700 point
00:03:43.030 we'll

00:03:43.419 start
00:03:43.750 to
00:03:43.870 massage
00:03:44.019 it
00:03:44.590 and
00:03:44.829 that'll
00:03:45.160 bring

00:03:45.400 out
00:03:45.609 more
00:03:45.880 of
00:03:45.940 the
00:03:46.239 juice
00:03:46.480 more
00:03:46.780 the
00:03:46.989 moisture

00:03:47.500 and
00:03:47.970 then
00:03:48.970 we
00:03:49.599 will
00:03:49.870 have
00:03:50.079 our
00:03:50.410 brine
00:03:50.769 for
00:03:51.519 our

00:03:52.000 fermentation
00:03:52.560 process

00:03:53.810 so
00:03:54.380 we'll
00:03:54.800 just
00:03:55.010 do
00:03:55.280 a
00:03:55.700 tablespoon
00:03:56.510 of
00:03:56.540 the

00:03:56.780 caraway
00:03:57.110 seeds
00:04:03.400 and
00:04:04.959 then
00:04:05.959 I
00:04:05.990 have
00:04:06.140 two

00:04:06.440 tablespoons

00:04:08.209 ground
00:04:08.840 up
00:04:11.110 and

00:04:12.730 then

00:04:18.320 all
00:04:18.440 of
00:04:18.829 the
00:04:18.950 cabbage
00:04:19.450 and
00:04:20.450 it's
00:04:20.630 fine
00:04:20.900 if
00:04:21.169 it

00:04:21.320 doesn't
00:04:21.620 reach
00:04:21.769 all
00:04:22.010 of

00:04:22.310 just
00:04:22.639 to
00:04:22.910 help
00:04:23.320 the

00:04:24.320 wilting
00:04:24.830 process
00:04:25.430 we
00:04:25.730 want
00:04:25.880 it
00:04:26.060 to

00:04:27.470 much
00:04:27.710 of

00:04:28.070 cabbage
00:04:28.490 as

00:04:29.140 possible
00:04:31.060 and
00:04:32.060 like
00:04:32.300 I

00:04:32.990 the

00:04:33.140 bowl

00:04:36.710 here
00:04:38.320 and
00:04:39.320 you
00:04:39.410 could
00:04:39.530 even
00:04:39.650 divide

00:04:40.040 this
00:04:40.190 up
00:04:40.430 between
00:04:40.669 two
00:04:41.000 different
00:04:41.270 bowls
00:04:41.900 if

00:04:42.440 wanted
00:04:46.450 all
00:04:47.450 right

00:04:56.450 a
00:04:56.510 third
00:04:56.870 so

00:05:34.640 been
00:05:34.789 massaging
00:05:35.210 this

00:06:31.790 is
00:06:31.820 totally
00:06:32.540 fine

00:06:32.720 it
00:06:33.020 doesn't
00:06:33.170 really
00:06:33.380 matter
00:06:33.650 how
00:06:33.950 many
00:06:34.010 jars

00:06:34.460 it

00:06:44.810 get
00:06:44.990 like
00:06:45.170 a

00:06:45.260 pounder
00:06:45.860 and
00:06:46.190 just
00:06:46.760 try
00:06:46.970 and
00:06:47.120 pack
00:06:47.390 it
00:06:47.600 all

00:06:47.720 down
00:06:48.020 to
00:06:48.200 the
00:06:48.320 bottom
00:06:48.620 so
00:06:48.650 that
00:06:48.890 the
00:06:49.040 water

00:06:49.130 rises
00:06:49.910 up
00:06:50.090 and
00:06:50.360 covers
00:06:51.110 the
00:06:51.380 top
00:06:51.650 and
00:06:52.070 then

00:06:52.790 from
00:06:52.970 here
00:06:53.000 you
00:06:53.330 want
00:06:53.480 to
00:06:53.540 get
00:06:53.660 that
00:06:53.780 cabbage

00:06:54.320 leaf
00:06:54.620 that
00:06:54.830 you
00:06:54.920 took
00:06:55.100 off
00:06:55.280 in
00:06:55.670 the
00:06:55.790 beginning

00:06:56.090 before
00:06:56.390 you
00:06:56.570 shredded
00:06:57.020 your
00:06:57.140 cabbage
00:06:57.550 you

00:06:58.550 just
00:06:58.700 want
00:06:58.850 to
00:06:59.000 get
00:06:59.750 a
00:07:00.520 piece
00:07:01.520 or
00:07:01.970 two
00:07:02.570 big

00:07:03.290 enough
00:07:03.560 to
00:07:04.520 cover
00:07:04.790 the
00:07:05.510 top
00:07:08.110 of
00:07:09.190 your
00:07:10.190 cabbage

00:07:10.670 inside
00:07:11.270 your
00:07:11.480 jar
00:07:11.810 and
00:07:12.700 then
00:07:13.700 this
00:07:14.030 actually

00:07:14.510 stays
00:07:14.870 down
00:07:15.170 there
00:07:15.200 really
00:07:15.530 good
00:07:15.710 on
00:07:15.860 its
00:07:16.040 own

00:07:16.190 this
00:07:16.460 is
00:07:16.580 basically
00:07:16.910 to
00:07:17.150 keep
00:07:17.390 any
00:07:18.020 couch
00:07:18.440 from

00:07:18.860 rising
00:07:19.070 to
00:07:19.340 the
00:07:19.430 top
00:07:19.670 and
00:07:19.910 being
00:07:20.090 exposed
00:07:20.480 to

00:07:20.630 the
00:07:20.810 air
00:07:20.990 because
00:07:21.350 that
00:07:21.530 can
00:07:21.770 can
00:07:23.140 allow
00:07:24.140 it
00:07:24.260 to

00:07:24.410 grow
00:07:24.530 a
00:07:24.650 mold
00:07:24.890 and
00:07:25.010 you
00:07:25.160 don't
00:07:25.340 really
00:07:25.430 want
00:07:25.520 it

00:07:25.790 to
00:07:25.970 do
00:07:26.120 that
00:07:26.300 you
00:07:26.420 want
00:07:26.600 to
00:07:26.690 keep
00:07:26.840 it
00:07:27.020 submerged

00:07:27.500 underneath
00:07:27.980 the
00:07:28.280 brine
00:07:28.990 and
00:07:29.990 so
00:07:30.350 this
00:07:30.650 is

00:07:30.830 actually
00:07:31.220 staying
00:07:31.490 down
00:07:31.760 just
00:07:32.090 fine
00:07:32.300 on
00:07:32.570 its

00:07:32.720 own
00:07:32.980 but
00:07:33.980 you
00:07:34.220 can
00:07:34.400 also
00:07:34.640 use
00:07:35.710 something
00:07:36.710 of

00:07:37.040 weight
00:07:37.280 like
00:07:37.610 you
00:07:37.820 can
00:07:38.000 put
00:07:38.240 like
00:07:38.510 large

00:07:38.870 stones
00:07:39.860 on
00:07:40.370 top
00:07:40.400 of
00:07:40.850 the
00:07:40.970 cabbage
00:07:41.270 leaf
00:07:41.570 or

00:07:41.870 I've
00:07:42.140 even
00:07:42.410 used
00:07:42.440 the
00:07:42.980 sharp
00:07:43.250 glass
00:07:43.490 before

00:07:43.820 that
00:07:44.240 I
00:07:44.330 use
00:07:45.160 for
00:07:46.160 like
00:07:46.400 my
00:07:47.330 wheatgrass
00:07:47.750 and
00:07:48.200 I

00:07:48.410 just
00:07:48.650 stick
00:07:48.890 the
00:07:49.040 shot
00:07:49.280 glass
00:07:49.520 in
00:07:49.820 there
00:07:50.150 and

00:07:50.480 then
00:07:50.990 screw
00:07:51.350 the
00:07:51.470 cap
00:07:51.680 on
00:07:51.950 and
00:07:52.250 it
00:07:52.400 gives

00:07:53.030 enough
00:07:53.270 pressure
00:07:53.540 that
00:07:53.720 it
00:07:53.960 keeps
00:07:54.200 the

00:07:54.860 cabbage
00:07:55.220 leaf
00:07:55.490 down
00:07:56.330 there
00:07:58.960 and
00:07:59.960 then
00:08:00.950 we'll

00:08:01.100 just
00:08:01.310 screw
00:08:01.730 the
00:08:01.850 lid
00:08:02.030 on
00:08:03.190 you
00:08:04.190 want
00:08:04.430 to
00:08:04.700 have
00:08:04.910 a

00:08:04.940 good
00:08:05.300 you
00:08:05.900 know
00:08:05.930 inch
00:08:06.350 or
00:08:06.800 so
00:08:07.070 at
00:08:07.490 the
00:08:07.730 top
00:08:07.940 left

00:08:08.720 of
00:08:10.210 space
00:08:11.210 for
00:08:11.600 the
00:08:11.720 air
00:08:11.930 to
00:08:12.230 be
00:08:12.440 because
00:08:13.070 air

00:08:13.430 will
00:08:13.670 be
00:08:13.790 coming
00:08:14.090 up
00:08:14.240 from
00:08:14.600 the
00:08:14.660 bottom
00:08:14.900 as
00:08:15.230 it

00:08:15.780 so
00:08:16.080 you
00:08:16.139 want
00:08:16.440 some
00:08:16.770 place
00:08:16.950 for
00:08:17.160 that
00:08:17.280 to
00:08:17.430 go
00:08:17.550 so

00:08:17.850 you
00:08:17.910 don't
00:08:18.150 have
00:08:18.420 an
00:08:18.690 exploding
00:08:19.290 glass
00:08:19.830 jar

00:08:20.220 and
00:08:20.520 so
00:08:21.389 the
00:08:21.510 last
00:08:21.690 thing
00:08:21.930 that
00:08:21.990 you
00:08:22.170 want
00:08:22.350 to

00:08:22.410 do
00:08:22.530 is

00:08:23.550 the
00:08:23.970 top
00:08:24.180 of
00:08:24.389 the
00:08:24.480 jar
00:08:24.780 with
00:08:25.200 some

00:08:25.500 kind
00:08:25.710 of
00:08:25.770 label
00:08:26.100 or
00:08:26.250 tape
00:08:26.490 with
00:08:27.060 the
00:08:27.270 date
00:08:27.540 that

00:08:27.900 you
00:08:28.370 started
00:08:29.370 this
00:08:29.580 batch
00:08:29.910 that
00:08:30.240 you
00:08:30.330 actually

00:08:30.690 screw
00:08:31.050 the
00:08:31.200 top
00:08:31.380 on
00:08:31.650 and
00:08:32.270 set
00:08:33.270 it
00:08:33.390 on
00:08:33.510 the

00:08:33.570 counter
00:08:34.340 okay
00:08:35.340 so
00:08:35.640 we
00:08:36.060 have
00:08:36.300 our
00:08:36.659 cabbage

00:08:37.289 packed
00:08:37.680 in
00:08:37.950 here
00:08:37.979 and
00:08:39.140 our
00:08:40.490 cabbage
00:08:41.490 leaf
00:08:41.729 on

00:08:41.909 top
00:08:41.940 and
00:08:42.419 our
00:08:42.479 weight
00:08:42.659 on
00:08:42.840 top
00:08:43.080 on
00:08:43.409 our
00:08:43.560 lid
00:08:43.979 on

00:08:44.010 tie
00:08:44.400 it
00:08:44.460 with
00:08:44.700 the
00:08:44.850 date
00:08:45.090 marked
00:08:45.480 on
00:08:45.660 there
00:08:45.930 and

00:08:46.970 now
00:08:47.970 we
00:08:48.030 just
00:08:48.540 want
00:08:48.780 to
00:08:48.870 sit
00:08:49.110 it
00:08:49.230 out
00:08:49.410 on
00:08:49.589 the

00:08:49.710 counter
00:08:49.950 for
00:08:51.020 three
00:08:52.020 to
00:08:52.290 four
00:08:52.530 days
00:08:52.589 and

00:08:53.520 that's
00:08:54.180 why
00:08:54.870 we
00:08:55.020 label
00:08:55.350 it
00:08:55.470 with
00:08:55.589 the
00:08:55.620 date
00:08:55.740 so

00:08:56.130 that
00:08:56.190 we
00:08:56.339 can
00:08:56.520 reference
00:08:56.670 that
00:08:57.030 to
00:08:57.270 see
00:08:57.450 when

00:08:57.600 it's
00:08:57.750 time
00:08:58.020 to
00:08:58.800 take
00:08:58.980 it
00:08:59.070 off
00:08:59.190 of
00:08:59.339 the
00:08:59.460 counter

00:08:59.640 and
00:08:59.760 put
00:08:59.970 it
00:09:00.060 into
00:09:00.300 the
00:09:00.420 fridge
00:09:00.630 so
00:09:01.170 after

00:09:01.650 three
00:09:01.830 or
00:09:01.860 four
00:09:01.950 days
00:09:02.100 sticking
00:09:02.700 it
00:09:02.790 into
00:09:02.940 the

00:09:03.089 fridge
00:09:03.300 and
00:09:03.630 then
00:09:03.750 you
00:09:03.870 can
00:09:04.020 just
00:09:04.200 leave
00:09:04.410 it

00:09:04.530 there
00:09:04.680 indefinitely
00:09:05.280 and
00:09:05.610 this
00:09:06.270 stuff
00:09:06.510 will

00:09:06.630 last
00:09:06.900 pretty
00:09:07.290 much
00:09:07.380 forever
00:09:07.680 because
00:09:08.550 the

00:09:09.300 process
00:09:09.839 of
00:09:09.990 fermentation
00:09:10.110 is
00:09:11.040 actually
00:09:11.880 a

00:09:12.890 preservative
00:09:13.890 method
00:09:14.790 and
00:09:15.180 that
00:09:15.900 was
00:09:16.170 was
00:09:16.589 one

00:09:16.740 of
00:09:16.860 the
00:09:16.920 main
00:09:17.040 reasons
00:09:17.460 why
00:09:18.000 it
00:09:18.060 was
00:09:18.450 used
00:09:18.960 in

00:09:19.610 in
00:09:20.610 cultures
00:09:21.350 originally
00:09:22.350 was
00:09:22.710 to
00:09:22.740 preserve

00:09:23.130 vegetables
00:09:23.970 so
00:09:24.960 I
00:09:25.320 hope
00:09:25.589 you
00:09:25.710 enjoyed
00:09:26.010 this

00:09:26.220 video
00:09:26.400 and
00:09:26.580 I
00:09:26.970 hope
00:09:27.150 you
00:09:27.210 have
