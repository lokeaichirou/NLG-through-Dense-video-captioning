00:04:49.330 caused
00:04:49.510 me

00:04:49.660 so
00:04:49.990 much
00:04:50.260 confusion
00:04:50.680 when
00:04:51.250 I
00:04:51.669 was
00:04:51.940 first

00:04:52.210 better

00:04:53.620 Japanese

00:04:54.039 duration
00:04:54.370 cuisine
00:04:54.700 because
00:04:55.150 I

00:04:55.690 really

00:04:55.870 know

00:04:56.169 to
00:04:56.200 use
00:04:56.440 the
00:04:56.650 spoon
00:04:56.919 I
00:04:57.190 thought
00:04:58.180 that

00:04:58.690 I
00:04:59.139 don't
00:04:59.680 know
00:04:59.740 you
00:04:59.889 just
00:04:59.919 use
00:05:00.190 it
00:05:00.220 to
00:05:00.460 like

00:05:01.110 drink
00:05:02.110 the
00:05:02.289 broth
00:05:02.500 like
00:05:03.070 you
00:05:03.280 do
00:05:03.430 in
00:05:03.729 Western

00:05:04.570 cuisine
00:05:04.750 but
00:05:05.710 actually
00:05:06.250 what
00:05:07.090 you
00:05:07.210 do
00:05:07.389 and
00:05:07.660 by

00:05:07.750 the
00:05:07.810 way
00:05:07.930 this
00:05:08.020 is
00:05:08.139 called
00:05:08.320 the
00:05:08.380 TD
00:05:08.650 dengue
00:05:09.160 and

00:05:09.520 Japanese
00:05:10.210 I'll
00:05:10.630 have
00:05:10.810 you
00:05:10.900 written
00:05:11.050 some

00:05:11.480 the
00:05:11.600 screen
00:05:11.900 Chiti
00:05:12.230 dingus
00:05:12.740 and
00:05:13.160 what
00:05:14.000 you
00:05:14.120 do

00:05:14.530 is
00:05:16.060 you
00:05:17.060 pick
00:05:17.240 up
00:05:17.360 the
00:05:17.480 noodles
00:05:17.750 Bachelor
00:05:18.050 to

00:05:18.230 eat
00:05:18.350 in
00:05:18.440 the
00:05:18.500 noodles
00:05:18.800 so
00:05:18.890 I
00:05:18.920 can't
00:05:19.160 really
00:05:19.250 do

00:05:19.400 this
00:05:19.460 but
00:05:19.790 what
00:05:20.480 you
00:05:20.510 do
00:05:20.810 is
00:05:21.110 you
00:05:21.500 pick
00:05:21.650 up
00:05:21.800 the

00:05:21.950 noodles
00:05:22.160 with
00:05:22.430 your
00:05:22.580 chopsticks
00:05:23.090 and
00:05:23.300 since

00:05:23.510 they're
00:05:23.750 hot
00:05:23.960 while
00:05:24.860 they're
00:05:25.700 cooling
00:05:25.910 in

00:05:26.300 order
00:05:26.540 to
00:05:26.660 let
00:05:26.810 them
00:05:26.960 cool
00:05:27.170 faster
00:05:27.650 which
00:05:28.400 I

00:05:28.550 believe
00:05:28.820 you
00:05:29.660 set
00:05:30.350 them
00:05:30.560 while
00:05:31.550 still
00:05:31.580 holding

00:05:31.940 them
00:05:32.240 with
00:05:32.690 your
00:05:32.840 chopsticks
00:05:33.290 you
00:05:33.500 set
00:05:33.770 like

00:05:33.920 this
00:05:34.070 little
00:05:34.340 base
00:05:34.490 like
00:05:34.790 the
00:05:34.880 end
00:05:35.030 of
00:05:35.240 the

00:05:35.330 noodle
00:05:35.600 in
00:05:35.810 the
00:05:36.850 little
00:05:37.850 area
00:05:38.120 of
00:05:38.240 the
00:05:38.360 spoon

00:05:38.630 so
00:05:38.900 it's
00:05:39.080 cool
00:05:39.320 so
00:05:39.590 it's
00:05:39.740 not
00:05:39.860 sitting
00:05:40.190 in
00:05:40.250 the

00:05:40.340 hot
00:05:40.520 broth
00:05:40.790 so
00:05:41.060 it
00:05:41.150 makes
00:05:41.300 it
00:05:41.390 easier
00:05:41.690 to
00:05:41.720 eat

00:05:41.930 so
00:05:42.470 usually
00:05:42.860 when
00:05:43.040 you're
00:05:43.160 eating
00:05:43.520 you
00:05:43.970 have

00:05:44.210 the
00:05:44.960 chopsticks
00:05:45.350 in
00:05:45.470 your
00:05:45.590 dominant
00:05:45.740 hand

00:05:46.010 which
00:05:46.340 is
00:05:46.370 my
00:05:46.520 right
00:05:46.640 and
00:05:47.270 I
00:05:47.930 have
00:05:48.110 the

00:05:48.290 cheating
00:05:48.710 game
00:05:48.950 or
00:05:49.130 you
00:05:49.220 can
00:05:49.370 just
00:05:49.520 call

00:05:49.610 so-called
00:05:50.000 like
00:05:50.150 I
00:05:50.870 think

00:05:51.620 spoon
00:05:52.070 and
00:05:52.370 spoon
00:05:52.520 and
00:05:52.820 Japanese
00:05:53.590 so
00:05:54.590 you
00:05:54.710 hold

00:05:54.830 it
00:05:54.950 in
00:05:55.010 your
00:05:55.100 left
00:05:55.250 hand
00:05:55.610 and
00:05:55.820 you
00:05:56.060 just
00:05:56.270 kind

00:05:56.600 of
00:05:56.660 flip
00:05:56.990 the
00:05:57.140 noodles
00:05:57.470 like
00:05:58.250 this
00:05:58.520 it's
00:05:58.760 like

00:05:59.260 also
00:06:00.260 another
00:06:00.860 fact
00:06:01.160 about
00:06:01.340 Japanese
00:06:01.700 culture

00:06:01.750 it
00:06:02.750 isn't
00:06:03.170 considered
00:06:03.380 rude
00:06:03.830 when
00:06:04.160 you
00:06:04.400 are

00:06:04.520 slurping
00:06:05.150 your
00:06:05.570 soup
00:06:05.930 actually
00:06:06.410 your
00:06:06.560 noodles

00:06:06.920 I
00:06:07.760 think
00:06:08.300 this
00:06:08.420 was
00:06:08.750 only
00:06:09.160 appropriate
00:06:10.160 when

00:06:10.670 you're
00:06:10.880 eating
00:06:11.090 traditional
00:06:11.540 Japanese
00:06:12.170 foods

00:06:12.410 like
00:06:12.500 them
00:06:12.710 in
00:06:13.010 auradon
00:06:13.310 or
00:06:13.670 soba
00:06:13.970 not
00:06:14.540 like

00:06:14.810 spaghetti
00:06:15.230 or
00:06:15.410 things
00:06:15.620 like
00:06:15.710 that
00:06:15.860 but
00:06:16.780 when
00:06:17.780 I

00:06:17.810 was
00:06:17.960 in
00:06:18.110 Japan
00:06:18.230 the
00:06:18.500 first
00:06:18.740 time
00:06:19.040 I
00:06:20.080 knew
00:06:21.080 this

00:06:21.230 going
00:06:21.440 over
00:06:21.800 there
00:06:22.010 that
00:06:22.640 slurping
00:06:23.270 the

00:06:23.390 noodles
00:06:23.690 is
00:06:23.960 a
00:06:23.990 sign
00:06:24.320 that
00:06:24.640 you're
00:06:25.640 enjoying

00:06:25.970 the
00:06:26.180 food
00:06:26.420 that
00:06:26.600 you
00:06:26.720 think
00:06:26.900 it
00:06:26.990 takes
00:06:27.170 good

00:06:27.440 never
00:06:27.620 something
00:06:27.740 like
00:06:27.890 that
00:06:28.070 and
00:06:28.520 I
00:06:28.730 tried
00:06:29.000 so

00:06:29.300 many
00:06:29.390 times
00:06:29.510 to
00:06:29.990 practice
00:06:30.230 before
00:06:30.860 I
00:06:30.890 went

00:06:31.070 over
00:06:31.340 trying
00:06:31.850 to
00:06:31.940 flirt
00:06:32.210 but
00:06:32.390 it
00:06:32.540 was
00:06:32.630 really

00:06:32.870 hard
00:06:33.110 for
00:06:33.230 me
00:06:33.320 to
00:06:33.410 kind
00:06:33.560 of
00:06:33.680 learn
00:06:33.860 how
00:06:33.890 to

00:06:34.070 inhale
00:06:34.610 when
00:06:34.940 I
00:06:34.970 was
00:06:35.180 sucking
00:06:35.360 noodles
00:06:35.870 I

00:06:35.990 guess
00:06:36.170 that's
00:06:36.560 what
00:06:36.680 you
00:06:36.770 do
00:06:36.890 when
00:06:36.980 you
00:06:37.100 suck

00:06:37.250 your
00:06:37.400 noodles
00:06:37.640 anyway
00:06:38.000 but
00:06:38.720 it
00:06:39.440 was
00:06:39.590 just
00:06:39.710 so

00:06:40.070 so
00:06:40.520 hard
00:06:40.760 for
00:06:41.000 me
00:06:41.120 to
00:06:41.600 like
00:06:41.810 inhale
00:06:42.170 and

00:06:42.320 actually
00:06:42.560 make
00:06:42.710 it
00:06:42.860 sound
00:06:43.070 so
00:06:44.000 the
00:06:44.450 first
00:06:44.690 time

00:06:44.840 I
00:06:44.870 was
00:06:45.050 out
00:06:45.430 eating
00:06:46.430 I

00:06:47.030 was
00:06:47.150 on
00:06:47.330 man

00:06:47.540 with
00:06:47.660 my

00:06:56.270 okay
00:06:56.690 that
00:06:56.840 you
00:06:56.960 think

00:06:57.440 taste
00:06:57.590 good
