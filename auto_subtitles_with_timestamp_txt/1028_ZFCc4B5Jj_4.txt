00:00:44.879 one

00:00:45.030 egg

00:00:49.770 there
00:00:49.980 this
00:00:50.640 texture
00:00:51.059 was
00:00:51.329 perfect

00:00:51.840 for
00:00:52.020 me

00:01:06.540 I
00:01:07.020 use
00:01:07.590 vegetable
00:01:08.189 oil

00:01:09.750 about
00:01:09.840 four
00:01:10.260 to
00:01:10.290 five

00:01:10.380 minutes
00:01:10.880 chicken
