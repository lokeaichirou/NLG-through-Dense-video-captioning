00:02:35.519 saltiness
00:02:36.120 in
00:02:36.360 this
00:02:36.510 helps
00:02:36.900 to
00:02:37.110 enhance

00:02:37.560 the
00:02:37.890 flavor
00:02:38.160 at

00:02:52.680 want
00:02:52.830 to
00:02:53.040 you
00:02:53.190 could
00:02:53.400 add
00:02:53.550 a

00:02:53.580 dash
00:02:53.940 of

00:02:54.420 wine
00:02:54.690 to
00:02:54.990 this
00:02:55.760 which
00:02:56.760 helps
00:02:57.090 to

00:02:57.180 give
00:02:57.390 a
00:02:57.420 nice
00:02:57.630 flavor
00:02:57.660 to
00:02:58.260 it
00:02:58.530 and
00:02:59.870 I'm

00:03:03.120 chopped
00:03:03.480 thyme
00:03:05.600 so
00:03:06.600 I'm
00:03:06.660 now
00:03:06.810 going
00:03:07.020 to
00:03:07.080 leave

00:03:07.350 this
00:03:07.560 the
00:03:07.830 simmer
00:03:08.100 for
00:03:08.400 about
00:03:08.490 five
00:03:09.000 minutes

00:03:11.510 so
00:03:12.510 once
00:03:12.690 I've
00:03:12.930 simmered
00:03:13.290 the
00:03:13.410 lamb
00:03:13.590 I'm
00:03:13.890 now

00:03:14.100 going
00:03:14.310 to
00:03:14.460 season
00:03:14.700 it
00:03:16.010 and
00:03:17.010 I
00:03:17.160 like
00:03:17.370 quite
00:03:17.730 a

00:03:17.760 lot
00:03:18.060 of
00:03:18.300 freshly
00:03:18.540 ground
00:03:18.870 black
00:03:19.140 pepper

00:03:22.400 but
00:03:23.400 I'm
00:03:23.550 going
00:03:23.820 to
00:03:23.940 add
00:03:24.090 just
00:03:24.120 a
00:03:24.450 little
00:03:24.720 bit

00:03:24.840 of
00:03:24.990 salt
00:03:25.290 because
00:03:25.860 the
00:03:26.130 Worcestershire
00:03:26.490 sauce

00:03:26.850 is
00:03:27.150 quite
00:03:27.300 salty
00:03:27.690 so
00:03:28.560 I
00:03:28.590 don't
00:03:28.830 want
00:03:28.980 to
00:03:29.070 make

00:03:29.220 the
00:03:29.460 recipe
00:03:29.850 over
00:03:30.030 salty
00:03:30.950 so
00:03:31.950 I'm
00:03:32.040 going
00:03:32.190 to

00:03:32.280 mix
00:03:32.490 that
00:03:32.760 in
00:03:35.990 and
00:03:36.990 then
00:03:37.260 I'm
00:03:37.560 going
00:03:37.770 to
00:03:37.860 spoon

00:03:38.190 this
00:03:38.510 into
00:03:39.510 an
00:03:39.600 ovenproof
00:03:39.840 dish

00:03:44.880 now
00:03:45.880 for
00:03:46.120 the
00:03:46.209 topping
00:03:46.480 for
00:03:46.690 this
00:03:47.080 I've
00:03:48.069 got

00:03:48.280 some
00:03:48.550 mashed
00:03:48.790 potato
00:03:49.180 about
00:03:49.810 a
00:03:49.840 kilo
00:03:50.230 of

00:03:50.410 mashed
00:03:50.739 potato
00:03:51.130 but
00:03:52.120 when
00:03:52.450 I'm
00:03:52.569 doing
00:03:52.810 this
00:03:52.930 at

00:03:53.080 home
00:03:53.260 I
00:03:53.290 tend
00:03:53.620 to
00:03:53.770 use
00:03:53.920 what
00:03:54.130 other
00:03:54.280 vegetables

00:03:54.910 I
00:03:55.060 have
00:03:55.300 I
00:03:55.630 think
00:03:56.170 it's
00:03:56.319 really
00:03:56.530 nice
00:03:56.770 my

00:03:57.040 favorite
00:03:57.580 is
00:03:57.730 a
00:03:57.760 mixture
00:03:58.180 of
00:03:58.300 half
00:03:58.569 potato
00:03:59.050 and

00:03:59.440 half
00:03:59.620 past
00:03:59.950 nip
00:04:00.569 sometimes
00:04:01.569 I
00:04:01.810 do
00:04:01.870 it
00:04:02.200 with

00:04:02.680 some
00:04:03.040 carrot
00:04:03.459 in
00:04:03.640 it
00:04:03.760 as
00:04:03.910 well
00:04:04.060 so
00:04:04.120 it
00:04:04.450 makes
00:04:04.660 it

00:04:04.750 an
00:04:04.870 orange-colored
00:04:05.170 mash
00:04:05.709 so
00:04:06.670 any
00:04:06.940 root

00:04:07.180 vegetables
00:04:07.870 even
00:04:08.050 celeriac
00:04:08.819 with
00:04:09.819 the
00:04:09.940 potato

00:04:10.269 makes
00:04:10.660 a
00:04:10.810 nice
00:04:10.989 mesh
00:04:12.000 so
00:04:13.000 I'm
00:04:13.060 going
00:04:13.239 to
00:04:13.330 spoon

00:04:13.599 this
00:04:13.840 on
00:04:14.080 top
00:04:14.349 and
00:04:17.130 I'm
00:04:18.130 just
00:04:18.310 spreading
00:04:18.639 it

00:04:18.880 out
00:04:19.000 so
00:04:19.299 it's
00:04:19.450 totally
00:04:19.930 covering
00:04:20.350 the
00:04:21.220 mince

00:04:23.460 I'm
00:04:24.460 just
00:04:24.669 texturing
00:04:25.240 the
00:04:25.270 top
00:04:25.630 very
00:04:26.050 slightly

00:04:28.560 and
00:04:29.560 I've
00:04:30.430 got
00:04:30.610 it
00:04:30.760 on
00:04:30.880 a
00:04:30.940 baking
00:04:31.210 tray
00:04:31.600 because

00:04:32.320 if
00:04:32.710 any
00:04:32.919 of
00:04:33.040 the
00:04:33.100 mixture
00:04:33.460 boils
00:04:33.790 out
00:04:33.940 of
00:04:34.120 the

00:04:34.210 dish
00:04:34.389 when
00:04:34.600 it's
00:04:34.750 in
00:04:34.870 the
00:04:34.960 oven
00:04:35.080 it
00:04:35.560 will
00:04:35.650 fall

00:04:35.860 onto
00:04:36.040 the
00:04:36.190 baking
00:04:36.610 tray
00:04:36.760 rather
00:04:37.120 than

00:04:37.389 dirtying
00:04:37.900 the
00:04:38.080 bottom
00:04:38.380 of
00:04:38.500 the
00:04:38.590 oven
00:04:38.910 now
00:04:39.910 this

00:04:40.090 needs
00:04:40.330 to
00:04:40.450 be
00:04:40.570 baked
00:04:40.930 at
00:04:41.320 180
00:04:42.040 degrees

00:04:42.430 centigrade
00:04:43.000 which
00:04:43.030 is
00:04:43.330 guess
00:04:43.690 mark
00:04:44.020 4
00:04:44.350 and
00:04:44.680 it

00:04:45.190 takes
00:04:45.430 about
00:04:45.580 30
00:04:46.000 to
00:04:46.270 40
00:04:46.600 minutes
00:04:46.630 or
00:04:47.380 it's

00:04:48.130 ready
00:04:48.370 when
00:04:48.640 the
00:04:48.760 top
00:04:48.970 is
00:04:49.150 nice
00:04:49.330 and
00:04:49.390 golden

00:04:49.630 and
00:04:50.229 you
00:04:50.590 can
00:04:50.740 see
00:04:51.010 the
00:04:51.190 filling
00:04:51.580 beginning
00:04:52.000 to

00:04:52.090 bubble
00:04:52.270 up
00:04:52.539 from
00:04:52.570 around
00:04:52.930 the
00:04:53.440 edges
00:04:53.770 of
00:04:53.919 the

00:04:53.979 potato
00:04:55.860 so
00:04:56.860 when
00:04:57.039 the
00:04:57.190 pie
00:04:57.400 is
00:04:57.460 ready
00:04:58.169 it

00:04:59.169 should
00:04:59.200 be
00:04:59.560 nice
00:04:59.740 and
00:05:00.039 golden
00:05:00.220 on
00:05:00.789 the
00:05:00.880 top

00:05:05.960 this
00:05:06.960 one
00:05:07.139 has
00:05:07.350 bubbled
00:05:07.770 out
00:05:07.889 a
00:05:07.950 bit
00:05:08.340 so
00:05:08.490 it's
00:05:08.669 a

00:05:08.730 good
00:05:08.880 job
00:05:09.090 that
00:05:09.120 I
00:05:09.450 put
00:05:09.660 it
00:05:09.810 on
00:05:09.930 the
00:05:10.050 baking

00:05:10.410 tray
00:05:10.440 and
00:05:11.960 that's
00:05:12.960 all
00:05:13.139 ready
00:05:13.350 for
00:05:13.650 serving
00:05:16.430 so

00:05:17.430 if
00:05:17.550 I
00:05:17.639 scoop
00:05:17.970 them
00:05:18.300 out
00:05:18.419 onto
00:05:18.840 a
00:05:18.870 plate

00:05:25.410 my
00:05:25.980 favorite
00:05:26.550 with
00:05:26.700 this
00:05:26.850 is
00:05:27.150 baked
00:05:27.600 beans
00:05:27.900 I

00:05:28.580 actually
00:05:29.580 like
00:05:29.910 them
00:05:30.060 cold
00:05:30.420 with
00:05:30.780 it
00:05:31.490 but
00:05:32.490 it's

00:05:32.640 also
00:05:32.790 good
00:05:33.150 to
00:05:33.330 serve
00:05:33.540 it
00:05:33.750 with
00:05:33.780 a
00:05:33.930 salad
00:05:38.120 so

00:05:39.120 that's
00:05:39.390 finished
00:05:39.930 shepherd's
00:05:40.560 pie
