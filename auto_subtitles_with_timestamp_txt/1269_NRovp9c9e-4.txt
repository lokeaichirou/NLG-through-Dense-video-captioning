00:02:09.879 and
00:02:10.390 blend
00:02:11.109 it
00:02:11.200 in
00:02:11.319 the

00:02:12.849 this
00:02:13.120 tomato

00:02:14.109 you
00:02:14.829 have
00:02:15.010 the
00:02:15.159 onion

00:02:15.769 so
00:02:16.099 first
00:02:16.370 of
00:02:16.610 all
00:02:16.760 we'll
00:02:17.060 first
00:02:17.390 take
00:02:17.659 oil
00:02:17.959 in

00:02:18.319 a
00:02:18.500 non-stick
00:02:18.530 pan
00:02:19.250 I
00:02:19.459 prefer
00:02:20.000 to
00:02:20.150 work
00:02:20.299 in
00:02:20.480 a

00:02:20.540 nonstick
00:02:20.959 pan
00:02:21.019 because
00:02:21.709 it
00:02:22.190 surely
00:02:22.819 saves
00:02:23.150 the

00:02:23.390 efforts
00:02:23.810 and
00:02:24.190 secondly
00:02:25.569 nothing
00:02:26.569 really

00:02:26.900 sticks
00:02:27.319 to
00:02:27.470 the
00:02:27.650 bottom
00:02:27.920 of
00:02:27.980 the
00:02:28.129 pan
00:02:28.370 so
00:02:28.580 you

00:02:28.610 not
00:02:28.819 really
00:02:29.120 worried
00:02:29.390 about
00:02:29.629 your
00:02:29.840 chicken

00:02:30.080 curry
00:02:30.440 or
00:02:30.560 any
00:02:30.739 other
00:02:30.980 preparation
00:02:31.580 getting

00:02:31.879 burned
00:02:32.150 unless
00:02:32.959 you
00:02:33.110 really
00:02:33.349 leave
00:02:33.560 it
00:02:33.739 in
00:02:33.860 the

00:02:34.159 pan
00:02:34.340 for
00:02:34.549 our
00:02:34.700 hours
00:02:35.030 and
00:02:35.180 forget
00:02:35.569 totally

00:02:35.870 about
00:02:36.079 it
00:02:36.260 nothing
00:02:36.769 like
00:02:37.040 this
00:02:37.129 is
00:02:37.280 gonna

00:02:37.459 happen
00:02:37.819 here
00:02:37.970 so
00:02:38.269 once
00:02:39.079 you
00:02:39.650 add
00:02:39.860 oil
00:02:40.489 to
00:02:40.610 this

00:02:40.879 we'll
00:02:41.360 add
00:02:41.629 some
00:02:41.989 whole
00:02:42.230 spices
00:02:43.090 in
00:02:44.090 whole

00:02:44.390 spices
00:02:44.780 will
00:02:45.620 be
00:02:45.829 using
00:02:46.190 cinnamon
00:02:46.670 cloves
00:02:47.299 and

00:02:47.660 green
00:02:47.989 cardamom
00:02:48.379 Indian
00:02:49.040 preparations
00:02:49.819 or

00:02:49.970 Indian
00:02:50.299 curries
00:02:50.690 are
00:02:50.959 quite
00:02:51.379 flavorful
00:02:52.040 with

00:02:52.190 whole
00:02:52.400 spices
00:02:52.940 as
00:02:53.120 well
00:02:53.150 and
00:02:53.709 these

00:02:54.709 ingredients
00:02:55.670 impart
00:02:56.420 a
00:02:56.569 lot
00:02:56.780 of

00:02:56.989 to

00:02:57.379 the
00:02:57.650 curry
00:02:57.859 but
00:02:58.489 you
00:02:58.609 don't
00:02:58.790 need
00:02:58.879 to

00:02:59.120 lots

00:02:59.359 of

00:04:50.390 stay
00:04:50.840 white
00:04:51.140 but
00:04:51.800 since
00:04:52.340 we
00:04:52.550 want

00:04:52.790 the
00:04:52.970 onion
00:04:53.240 to
00:04:53.390 Brown
00:04:53.630 we

00:04:54.410 add

00:04:54.590 anything
00:04:54.980 right
00:04:55.130 now

00:04:55.580 what
00:04:55.820 is
00:04:55.940 basically
00:04:56.330 browning
00:04:56.810 of
00:04:56.930 onion

00:04:57.260 onion
00:04:57.980 has
00:04:58.160 got
00:04:58.340 a
00:04:58.370 lot
00:04:58.550 of
00:04:58.580 sugar
00:04:58.910 and
00:04:59.210 when
00:04:59.840 it

00:04:59.960 comes
00:05:00.170 in
00:05:00.290 contact
00:05:00.530 with
00:05:00.830 heat
00:05:01.190 like
00:05:01.460 this

00:05:01.700 it's
00:05:02.020 caramelizes
00:05:03.020 and
00:05:03.430 that
00:05:04.430 is
00:05:04.580 why
00:05:04.760 brown

00:05:05.240 onions
00:05:05.720 always
00:05:05.960 stay
00:05:06.380 sweet
00:05:06.830 since
00:05:07.640 the

00:05:08.150 has
00:05:08.270 got
00:05:08.480 caramelized
00:05:08.950 it
00:05:09.950 tastes
00:05:10.490 sweet
00:05:10.880 and

00:05:11.180 it
00:05:11.360 also
00:05:11.540 turns
00:05:11.840 golden
00:05:12.320 brown
00:05:12.380 so
00:05:13.280 that
00:05:13.730 is
00:05:13.850 a

00:05:13.880 very
00:05:14.120 simple
00:05:14.710 logic
00:05:15.710 behind
00:05:15.890 Browning
00:05:16.490 of

00:05:16.580 onions
00:05:16.970 and
00:05:17.210 of
00:05:17.720 course
00:05:17.960 it
00:05:18.110 also
00:05:18.320 gives
00:05:18.680 a

00:05:18.830 very
00:05:18.950 good
00:05:19.100 flavor
00:05:19.550 to
00:05:19.700 the
00:05:19.970 curry
00:05:20.270 most
00:05:20.630 of

00:05:20.780 the

00:05:21.740 have
00:05:21.980 a
00:05:22.160 brown

00:05:22.490 onion
00:05:22.820 as
00:05:23.000 garnish
00:05:23.420 is
00:05:23.900 only
00:05:24.230 because
00:05:24.530 it

00:05:24.680 gives
00:05:24.950 good
00:05:25.220 look
00:05:25.700 at
00:05:25.970 the
00:05:26.150 same
00:05:26.390 time
00:05:26.600 it
00:05:26.750 also

00:05:26.900 tastes
00:05:27.620 nice
00:05:27.920 and
00:05:28.340 in
00:05:28.760 case
00:05:28.970 of
00:05:29.000 chicken
00:05:29.480 curry

00:05:29.720 we
00:05:29.930 have
00:05:30.140 to
00:05:30.320 brown
00:05:30.530 the
00:05:30.740 onion
00:05:30.940 because
00:05:31.940 in

00:05:32.750 case
00:05:33.050 of
00:05:33.320 onions
00:05:34.160 like
00:05:34.400 this
00:05:34.610 it
00:05:34.850 stays
00:05:35.240 quite

00:05:35.690 raw
00:05:36.050 it
00:05:36.320 doesn't
00:05:36.620 give
00:05:36.770 a
00:05:36.800 good
00:05:37.100 mouthfeel
00:05:37.900 so

00:05:39.560 the
00:05:39.800 onions

00:05:40.280 it
00:05:40.430 really
00:05:40.730 gets
00:05:41.030 combined
00:05:41.870 with
00:05:42.170 all
00:05:42.440 the

00:05:42.680 gravy
00:05:43.040 and
00:05:44.200 it

00:05:45.560 separate
00:05:46.070 from

00:05:46.430 gravy
00:05:46.670 you'll
00:05:47.390 always
00:05:47.600 notice
00:05:47.990 if

00:05:48.770 are

00:05:48.950 left
00:05:49.160 raw

00:05:50.360 are
00:05:50.450 not

00:05:50.870 sauteed
00:05:51.380 well
00:05:51.620 they
00:05:52.100 will
00:05:52.250 always
00:05:52.610 separate

00:05:53.090 us
00:05:53.210 and
00:05:53.240 you'll
00:05:53.450 have
00:05:53.600 a
00:05:53.630 tomato
00:05:53.960 grate
00:05:54.320 on
00:05:54.470 one

00:05:54.650 side
00:05:54.920 and
00:05:55.040 you'll
00:05:55.130 have
00:05:55.280 the
00:05:55.400 onions
00:05:55.700 on
00:05:55.820 one

00:05:56.000 side
00:05:56.240 so
00:05:56.810 it
00:05:56.900 is
00:05:56.990 always
00:05:57.230 important
00:05:57.890 to
00:05:57.980 saute

00:05:58.490 the
00:05:58.730 onions
00:05:59.090 to
00:05:59.240 an
00:05:59.360 extent
00:05:59.720 that
00:05:59.750 it
00:05:59.930 starts

00:06:00.320 Brown
00:06:00.620 okay
00:06:01.310 so
00:06:01.370 you
00:06:01.520 see
00:06:01.790 the
00:06:01.940 onion
00:06:02.240 has

00:06:02.480 already
00:06:03.050 started
00:06:03.350 browning
00:06:03.770 now
00:06:04.460 is
00:06:04.670 the
00:06:04.790 time

00:06:05.000 to
00:06:05.330 add
00:06:05.450 other
00:06:05.810 spices
00:06:06.550 we'll
00:06:07.550 first
00:06:07.820 start

00:06:07.970 off
00:06:08.330 with
00:06:09.220 ginger-garlic
00:06:10.220 paste
00:06:12.430 after
00:06:13.430 you

00:06:13.790 add
00:06:13.970 ginger-garlic
00:06:14.360 paste

00:06:17.689 we'll
00:06:18.689 now
00:06:19.050 add
00:06:20.599 turmeric
00:06:21.599 powder

00:06:22.849 we'll
00:06:23.849 add
00:06:23.999 red
00:06:24.270 chili
00:06:24.539 powder
00:06:24.780 red
00:06:25.080 chili

00:06:25.319 powder
00:06:25.529 would
00:06:25.710 depend
00:06:26.039 upon
00:06:26.400 the
00:06:26.580 kind
00:06:26.699 of

00:06:26.879 spicy
00:06:27.360 food
00:06:27.599 you
00:06:27.810 eat
00:06:27.900 at
00:06:28.080 home

00:06:28.499 we'll
00:06:28.830 add
00:06:28.979 some
00:06:29.009 cumin
00:06:29.639 powder
00:06:30.740 and
00:06:31.740 some

00:06:32.219 coriander
00:06:32.729 powder
00:06:33.210 now
00:06:33.689 after
00:06:34.050 you
00:06:34.139 add
00:06:34.349 the

00:06:34.560 whole
00:06:34.710 spices
00:06:34.969 there
00:06:35.969 are
00:06:36.090 chances
00:06:36.539 that
00:06:36.599 it

00:06:36.719 may
00:06:36.960 burn
00:06:37.229 so
00:06:38.009 you
00:06:38.039 may
00:06:38.310 add
00:06:38.580 very
00:06:39.120 little

00:06:39.270 water
00:06:40.909 and
00:06:41.909 just
00:06:42.689 mix
00:06:42.840 this
00:06:44.719 or
00:06:45.719 else
00:06:46.050 the

00:06:46.289 spices
00:06:46.740 would
00:06:46.979 have
00:06:47.189 all
00:06:47.430 got
00:06:47.699 burned
00:06:48.060 since

00:06:48.719 there
00:06:48.930 was
00:06:49.050 very
00:06:49.349 little
00:06:49.710 oil
00:06:49.889 that
00:06:50.340 we
00:06:50.520 had

00:06:50.639 used
00:06:50.819 in
00:06:51.090 the
00:06:51.240 masala
00:06:51.629 okay
00:06:52.349 so
00:06:52.409 now
00:06:52.620 this

00:06:52.889 needs
00:06:53.189 to
00:06:53.279 be
00:06:53.400 sorted
00:06:53.699 for
00:06:54.120 about
00:06:54.360 a
00:06:54.389 minute

00:06:57.139 after
00:06:58.139 you
00:06:58.379 have
00:06:58.500 done
00:06:58.680 this
00:06:58.919 we
00:06:59.610 have
00:06:59.819 to
00:06:59.969 now

00:07:00.120 add
00:07:00.419 tomatoes
00:07:01.169 and
00:07:01.409 tomatoes
00:07:01.860 are
00:07:01.889 in
00:07:02.279 pureed

00:07:02.699 form
00:07:03.590 so
00:07:04.590 we
00:07:04.740 have
00:07:04.860 pureed
00:07:05.310 the
00:07:05.460 tomatoes

00:07:05.879 we'll
00:07:06.060 add
00:07:06.210 all
00:07:06.240 of
00:07:06.419 it
00:07:06.689 here
00:07:08.060 you
00:07:09.060 see
00:07:09.240 after

00:07:09.449 you
00:07:09.689 add
00:07:09.900 the
00:07:10.169 tomato
00:07:10.620 puree
00:07:10.860 the
00:07:11.250 color

00:07:11.520 changes
00:07:12.240 and
00:07:12.750 it
00:07:13.080 goes
00:07:13.110 nice
00:07:13.620 and
00:07:14.039 bright
00:07:14.400 red

00:07:14.819 now
00:07:15.210 in
00:07:15.360 this
00:07:15.599 case
00:07:15.839 if
00:07:15.990 the
00:07:16.110 tomatoes
00:07:16.529 were

00:07:16.680 not
00:07:16.919 red
00:07:17.400 this
00:07:17.999 would
00:07:18.210 not
00:07:18.419 have
00:07:18.659 looked
00:07:18.810 very

00:07:18.990 good
00:07:19.289 it
00:07:19.439 would
00:07:19.560 have
00:07:19.680 given
00:07:19.860 an
00:07:20.219 insipid
00:07:21.029 look

00:07:21.300 and
00:07:21.539 apart
00:07:22.289 from
00:07:22.409 that
00:07:22.589 the
00:07:22.830 red
00:07:23.009 chili
00:07:23.279 powder

00:07:23.490 also
00:07:23.669 that
00:07:23.909 we
00:07:24.060 have
00:07:24.089 used
00:07:24.449 is
00:07:24.629 the
00:07:24.750 Kashmiri

00:07:25.169 when
00:07:25.409 it
00:07:25.560 is
00:07:25.680 not
00:07:25.919 very
00:07:26.250 spicy
00:07:26.550 in
00:07:26.819 it
00:07:26.939 imparts

00:07:27.419 good
00:07:27.689 color
00:07:28.050 so
00:07:28.800 as
00:07:28.979 far
00:07:29.189 as
00:07:29.250 possible
00:07:29.430 try
00:07:30.089 and

00:07:30.240 use
00:07:30.389 kashmiri
00:07:30.930 red
00:07:31.020 chilli
00:07:31.169 powder
00:07:31.770 and

00:07:32.159 bright
00:07:32.909 red
00:07:33.210 tomatoes
00:07:33.719 so
00:07:34.229 this
00:07:34.439 way
00:07:34.649 you'll

00:07:34.800 have
00:07:34.860 a

00:07:35.279 good
00:07:35.699 nice
00:07:36.060 bright
00:07:36.509 red
00:07:36.810 chicken

00:07:37.229 curry
00:07:37.439 now
00:07:38.009 after
00:07:38.520 we've
00:07:38.669 added
00:07:38.879 the
00:07:39.149 tomatoes

00:07:39.300 will
00:07:40.020 now
00:07:40.229 add
00:07:40.469 salt
00:07:40.939 salt
00:07:41.939 should
00:07:42.240 also
00:07:42.449 be

00:07:43.259 added
00:07:43.649 soon
00:07:44.550 after
00:07:44.969 the
00:07:45.060 tomatoes
00:07:45.210 because

00:07:45.990 that
00:07:46.830 way
00:07:47.039 the
00:07:47.189 tomatoes
00:07:47.580 cook
00:07:47.819 faster

00:07:48.270 because
00:07:48.569 once
00:07:48.839 we
00:07:48.960 add
00:07:49.080 salt
00:07:49.439 to
00:07:49.620 Tomatoes

00:07:50.129 it
00:07:50.250 automatically
00:07:50.729 leaves
00:07:51.029 all
00:07:51.270 the
00:07:51.419 moisture

00:07:51.899 and
00:07:52.080 once
00:07:52.710 all
00:07:52.919 the
00:07:53.069 moisture
00:07:53.399 in
00:07:53.520 the
00:07:53.550 tomato

00:07:53.939 is
00:07:54.240 evaporated
00:07:55.139 the
00:07:55.589 tomatoes
00:07:55.949 are
00:07:56.099 done
00:07:56.899 so

00:07:57.899 here
00:07:58.289 the
00:07:58.860 actual
00:07:59.279 cooking
00:07:59.569 happens
00:08:00.569 where

00:08:00.810 the
00:08:01.439 tomatoes
00:08:02.099 have
00:08:02.490 to
00:08:02.819 cook
00:08:03.240 as
00:08:03.569 in
00:08:04.349 tomatoes

00:08:05.099 if
00:08:05.279 they
00:08:05.430 are
00:08:05.550 left
00:08:05.759 raw
00:08:06.300 the
00:08:06.810 chicken
00:08:07.169 curry

00:08:07.319 doesn't
00:08:07.770 taste
00:08:07.979 too
00:08:08.250 good
00:08:08.279 so
00:08:09.060 onion
00:08:09.449 has
00:08:09.659 to

00:08:09.870 Brown

00:08:10.919 have
00:08:11.189 to
00:08:11.370 cook
00:08:11.580 well
00:08:11.909 so

00:08:12.539 these
00:08:12.719 two
00:08:13.050 things
00:08:13.080 if

00:08:13.649 happen
00:08:14.039 properly

00:08:14.550 in

00:08:18.300 you
00:08:18.419 can

00:08:18.569 actually
00:08:18.750 get

00:08:21.990 raw
00:08:22.560 and
00:08:22.919 after
00:08:23.759 a
00:08:23.789 while

00:08:24.060 once
00:08:24.509 the
00:08:24.689 oil
00:08:24.870 starts
00:08:25.379 separating
00:08:25.440 you'll

00:08:26.250 automatically
00:08:26.940 come
00:08:27.269 to
00:08:27.300 know

00:08:55.320 after
00:08:56.320 which
00:08:56.470 we'll
00:08:56.680 add
00:08:56.829 little
00:08:57.519 salt

00:08:57.730 we
00:08:58.480 have
00:08:58.570 already
00:08:58.720 added
00:08:59.019 some
00:08:59.380 salt
00:08:59.740 to
00:09:00.040 the

00:09:00.550 tomatoes
00:09:01.029 we
00:09:01.269 should
00:09:01.420 keep
00:09:01.570 that
00:09:01.630 in
00:09:01.810 mind
00:09:02.139 and

00:09:02.260 not
00:09:02.410 add
00:09:02.620 excess
00:09:03.100 in
00:09:03.279 that
00:09:03.459 case
00:09:03.670 the
00:09:03.790 chicken

00:09:04.120 curry
00:09:04.269 will
00:09:04.510 go
00:09:04.750 quite
00:09:05.350 salty
00:09:05.860 and
00:09:06.070 right
00:09:06.670 now

00:09:06.880 we'll
00:09:07.089 add
00:09:07.240 some
00:09:07.690 coriander
00:09:08.050 as
00:09:08.410 well
00:09:08.440 because

00:09:09.220 fresh
00:09:09.579 coriander
00:09:09.940 when
00:09:10.360 you
00:09:10.449 add
00:09:10.630 it
00:09:10.779 in
00:09:10.899 the

00:09:11.050 gravy
00:09:11.290 it
00:09:11.500 imparts
00:09:11.860 very
00:09:12.220 good
00:09:12.430 flavor
00:09:12.639 so

00:09:13.630 after
00:09:14.410 this
00:09:14.620 just
00:09:15.370 makes
00:09:15.790 this
00:09:16.060 nicely
00:09:18.600 now

00:09:19.600 don't
00:09:20.320 add
00:09:20.529 any
00:09:20.889 water
00:09:21.160 right
00:09:21.490 now
00:09:21.699 because

00:09:22.120 chicken
00:09:22.540 also
00:09:22.750 has
00:09:23.079 a
00:09:23.110 lot
00:09:23.380 of
00:09:23.410 moisture
00:09:23.920 in
00:09:24.070 it

00:09:24.250 and
00:09:24.399 it
00:09:25.089 will
00:09:25.269 also
00:09:25.510 leave
00:09:25.839 all
00:09:26.050 the
00:09:26.230 moisture

00:09:26.709 and
00:09:26.740 giving
00:09:27.130 the
00:09:27.370 curry
00:09:27.610 the
00:09:27.970 required

00:09:28.600 consistency
00:09:29.470 so
00:09:30.339 just
00:09:30.670 mix
00:09:30.970 this
00:09:31.209 in
00:09:31.420 like

00:09:31.899 this
00:09:32.139 we'll
00:09:32.980 add
00:09:33.100 some
00:09:33.490 garam
00:09:33.970 masala
00:09:34.449 powder

00:09:34.569 here
00:09:35.170 this
00:09:35.529 is
00:09:35.680 available
00:09:36.480 most
00:09:37.480 of
00:09:37.690 the

00:09:37.779 grocery
00:09:38.199 stores
00:09:38.560 once
00:09:39.220 again
00:09:39.579 will
00:09:39.790 mix
00:09:40.029 this

00:09:40.240 if
00:09:40.810 needed
00:09:41.260 we'll
00:09:41.740 add
00:09:41.949 water
00:09:42.310 but
00:09:42.850 that
00:09:43.029 will

00:09:43.180 be
00:09:43.209 towards
00:09:43.600 the
00:09:43.720 end
00:09:43.810 and
00:09:44.139 water
00:09:44.709 whatever

00:09:45.040 that

00:09:45.550 to
00:09:45.730 the
00:09:45.850 curry
00:09:46.089 will

00:09:46.569 be
00:09:46.690 hot
00:09:46.959 cause

00:09:48.160 cold
00:09:48.430 water

00:09:49.810 of
00:09:49.959 the
00:09:50.050 gravy
00:09:50.350 will
00:09:50.589 go
00:09:50.800 low

00:09:51.100 and
00:09:51.370 the
00:09:52.060 chicken
00:09:52.389 may
00:09:52.569 go
00:09:52.779 tough
00:09:53.139 so
00:09:53.470 it's

00:09:53.500 very
00:09:53.740 important
00:09:54.339 to
