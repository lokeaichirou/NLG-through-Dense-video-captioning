00:03:12.780 are
00:03:12.959 long
00:03:14.360 long

00:03:30.440 so
00:03:31.970 I've
00:03:32.970 caught
00:03:33.240 up
00:03:33.330 all
00:03:33.510 the

00:03:33.810 and
00:03:34.100 we're

00:03:35.100 nearly
00:03:35.340 get
00:03:35.550 to
00:03:35.670 go

00:03:36.960 taste
00:03:37.410 of
00:03:37.620 this
00:03:37.890 marinade
00:03:38.310 and

00:03:43.860 nice

00:03:44.040 so
00:03:44.340 but
00:03:44.670 I
00:03:44.700 think
00:03:44.940 it
00:03:45.030 needs
00:03:45.060 a
00:03:45.300 touch

00:03:46.590 had
00:03:46.740 any
00:03:46.920 puppy
00:03:47.340 up
00:03:47.459 so
00:03:48.050 again
00:03:49.050 if
00:03:49.200 we

00:03:49.230 decided
00:03:49.709 about
00:03:50.120 2
00:03:51.120 teaspoons
00:03:51.380 maybe
00:03:52.380 even

00:03:52.650 know
00:03:53.120 very
00:03:54.120 good
00:04:00.050 perfect
00:04:01.050 all
00:04:01.320 right
00:04:01.670 so

00:04:02.670 we'll
00:04:02.790 get
00:04:02.940 deep
00:04:05.510 mix
00:04:06.510 it
00:04:06.720 all
00:04:06.900 around
00:04:07.970 good

00:04:08.970 distribution
00:04:10.250 and
00:04:11.250 then
00:04:11.400 be
00:04:12.270 best
00:04:12.480 marinade

00:04:13.080 it
00:04:16.430 surface
00:04:17.430 so
00:04:18.419 we're
00:04:18.930 gonna
00:04:19.019 cut
00:04:19.260 the
00:04:19.350 beef

00:04:19.500 in

00:04:19.799 container
00:04:20.660 i
00:04:21.660 marinate
00:04:22.290 it
00:04:22.440 for
00:04:22.470 up

00:04:22.740 to
00:04:22.890 an
00:04:22.980 hour
00:04:23.070 in
00:04:23.370 fridge
00:04:23.700 and
00:04:23.910 actually
00:04:24.180 last

00:04:24.419 time

00:04:27.720 30
00:04:28.080 minutes
00:04:28.500 or

00:04:28.620 so
00:04:28.830 but
