00:01:06.740 water
00:01:07.740 should
00:01:08.100 not
00:01:08.280 be
00:01:08.490 there

00:01:08.729 all
00:01:08.939 right

00:01:09.420 that
00:01:09.450 in
00:01:09.720 mind
00:01:09.960 now
00:01:10.560 in

00:01:13.110 my
00:01:13.229 potato
00:01:13.530 I'm
00:01:13.920 gonna
00:01:14.130 cook
00:01:14.310 them
00:01:14.520 on
00:01:14.580 medium

00:01:14.880 and
00:01:15.240 not
00:01:15.390 all
00:01:15.659 the
00:01:15.810 way
00:01:15.930 through
00:01:15.960 now
00:01:16.530 what
00:01:16.680 you

00:01:16.830 want
00:01:17.100 is
00:01:17.280 basically
00:01:17.909 the
00:01:18.180 potato
00:01:18.450 should
00:01:18.780 be

00:01:18.990 kind
00:01:19.530 of
00:01:19.710 power
00:01:20.040 boiled
00:01:20.400 potatoes
00:01:20.790 not
00:01:21.299 wholly

00:01:21.780 cooked
00:01:22.110 potatoes
00:01:22.590 already
00:01:23.070 you

00:01:23.640 to
00:01:24.270 turn
00:01:24.420 brown
00:01:24.750 so
00:01:25.229 basically
00:01:25.560 each

00:01:25.830 trait
00:01:26.189 should
00:01:26.400 be
00:01:26.580 a
00:01:26.729 bit
00:01:27.240 firm
00:01:27.750 but
00:01:28.170 not
00:01:28.350 very

00:01:28.590 firm
00:01:28.890 as
00:01:29.070 you
00:01:29.130 can
00:01:29.430 see
00:01:29.579 all
00:01:29.790 right
00:01:30.360 I'm
00:01:30.570 gonna

00:01:30.720 transfer
00:01:31.500 potatoes

00:01:50.159 water

00:01:51.240 you
00:01:51.780 can
00:01:51.930 see
00:01:52.049 all

00:01:54.150 in
00:01:54.659 the
00:01:54.780 description
00:01:54.810 bar

00:01:55.409 down
00:01:55.440 below

00:02:00.000 rice
00:02:00.300 flour

00:02:00.600 alright
00:02:01.110 so
00:02:01.710 basically
00:02:02.090 rice
00:02:03.090 flour
00:02:03.390 is
00:02:03.570 added

00:02:03.690 to
00:02:03.960 combine
00:02:04.380 and
00:02:04.710 provide
00:02:05.130 that
00:02:05.369 crispness

00:02:14.959 now
00:02:15.959 no
00:02:16.170 butter
00:02:16.319 paper
00:02:16.470 I'm
00:02:16.680 going
00:02:16.800 to

00:02:16.860 transfer
00:02:17.430 my
00:02:17.459 potato
00:02:17.970 mixture
00:02:18.390 cover
00:02:18.959 it
00:02:19.170 with

00:02:19.380 another
00:02:19.530 butter
00:02:20.069 paper
00:02:20.750 flatten
00:02:21.750 it
00:02:21.900 with
00:02:22.080 the

00:02:22.170 rolling
00:02:22.560 pin
00:02:22.590 and
00:02:23.209 be
00:02:24.209 careful
00:02:24.570 you
00:02:24.630 don't

00:02:24.720 want
00:02:25.140 to
00:02:25.200 over
00:02:25.500 flatten
00:02:25.950 them
00:02:26.100 you
00:02:26.310 basically

00:02:26.700 want
00:02:27.090 them
00:02:27.390 to
00:02:27.930 be
00:02:28.050 around
00:02:28.140 a
00:02:28.410 centimeter

00:02:29.010 thick
00:02:29.070 and
00:02:29.459 then
00:02:29.880 refrigerate
00:02:30.300 it
00:02:30.690 to
00:02:30.840 four
00:02:31.050 to

00:02:31.200 six
00:02:31.410 hours
00:02:31.680 so
00:02:32.489 that
00:02:32.519 you
00:02:32.700 can
00:02:32.850 easily
00:02:33.060 cut

00:02:33.420 them
00:02:33.630 in
00:02:33.750 standard
00:02:34.350 highest
00:02:34.590 round
00:02:34.950 shapes
00:02:35.250 in

00:02:35.489 my
00:02:35.970 case
00:02:36.209 it
00:02:36.390 is
00:02:36.420 triangle
00:02:37.260 so
00:02:38.070 you
00:02:38.160 can
00:02:38.280 go
00:02:38.459 in

00:02:38.580 any
00:02:38.730 width
00:02:39.030 shape
00:02:39.239 what
00:02:39.450 you
00:02:39.570 want
00:02:39.810 you
00:02:40.080 can

00:02:40.260 cut
00:02:40.470 them
00:02:40.590 easily
00:02:40.830 and
00:02:41.130 they're
00:02:41.760 refrigerated

00:02:42.390 and
00:02:42.540 they're
00:02:42.690 freezed
00:02:45.410 so
00:02:46.410 apparently
00:02:47.130 the

00:02:47.400 video
00:02:47.730 has
00:02:47.940 moved
00:02:48.420 faster
00:02:49.080 and
00:02:49.290 my
00:02:49.470 speech
00:02:49.800 has

00:02:50.010 been
00:02:50.069 delayed
00:02:50.550 but
00:02:50.880 the
00:02:51.000 last
00:02:51.239 step
00:02:51.510 is

00:02:51.660 basically
00:02:51.860 simple
00:02:52.860 frying
00:02:53.250 you
00:02:53.550 need
00:02:53.730 hot
00:02:54.360 oil

00:02:54.630 and
00:02:54.959 you
00:02:55.260 need
00:02:55.470 to
00:02:55.739 golden
00:02:56.220 fry
00:02:56.489 your

00:02:56.730 hashbrowns
00:02:57.860 somewhat
00:02:58.860 like
00:02:59.610 this
00:03:00.049 now
00:03:01.049 the

00:03:01.110 real
00:03:01.410 taste
00:03:01.829 of
00:03:02.100 hash
00:03:02.400 brown
00:03:02.700 would
00:03:02.940 be
00:03:03.120 the

00:03:03.630 crispy
00:03:04.290 test
00:03:04.560 right
