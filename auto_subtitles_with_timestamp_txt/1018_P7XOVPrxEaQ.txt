00:02:38.410 do
00:02:38.590 a

00:02:38.620 big
00:02:38.860 hunk
00:02:39.160 and
00:02:39.370 piece
00:02:39.550 of
00:02:39.580 chicken
00:02:39.880 that's

00:02:40.180 just
00:02:40.480 it's
00:02:40.900 not
00:02:41.110 a
00:02:41.170 practical
00:02:41.740 fried
00:02:42.160 rice

00:02:42.400 size
00:02:42.730 so
00:02:43.450 I'm
00:02:43.540 just
00:02:43.660 going
00:02:43.780 to
00:02:43.870 marinate
00:02:44.320 it
00:02:44.470 in

00:02:44.590 my
00:02:45.030 soy
00:02:46.030 sauce
00:02:46.330 just
00:02:46.750 a
00:02:46.959 teaspoon
00:02:47.590 or
00:02:47.709 so
00:02:48.330 all

00:02:49.330 the
00:02:49.540 details
00:02:49.870 of
00:02:50.080 the
00:02:50.200 recipe
00:02:50.620 is
00:02:50.770 on
00:02:50.890 my

00:02:51.040 website
00:02:51.459 if
00:02:51.670 you
00:02:51.730 want
00:02:51.820 measurements
00:02:52.390 and

00:02:52.480 everything
00:02:52.540 that's
00:02:52.989 all
00:02:53.530 there
00:02:54.220 so
00:02:54.760 just
00:02:55.060 some

00:02:55.180 soy
00:02:55.360 sauce
00:02:55.420 and
00:02:55.930 I'm
00:02:55.989 also
00:02:56.200 going
00:02:56.860 to
00:02:56.950 put
00:02:57.280 a

00:02:57.310 little
00:02:57.520 bit
00:02:57.700 of
00:02:57.790 vegetable
00:02:58.209 oil
00:02:58.360 I
00:02:58.690 think
00:02:58.780 it

00:02:59.110 helps
00:02:59.380 keep
00:02:59.590 things
00:02:59.920 moist
00:03:00.280 and
00:03:00.610 also
00:03:00.880 when

00:03:01.030 you
00:03:01.120 add
00:03:01.270 it
00:03:01.450 to
00:03:01.600 the
00:03:01.720 pan
00:03:01.989 it
00:03:02.290 helps
00:03:02.920 the

00:03:03.010 chicken
00:03:03.190 spread
00:03:04.000 easier
00:03:04.660 so
00:03:05.290 they're
00:03:05.440 not
00:03:05.590 you

00:03:05.739 know
00:03:05.770 sticking
00:03:06.370 together
00:03:06.550 into
00:03:06.970 a
00:03:07.000 clump
00:03:07.420 so

00:03:07.900 we're
00:03:07.989 going
00:03:08.080 to
00:03:08.140 let
00:03:08.260 that
00:03:08.320 go
00:03:08.620 you
00:03:08.680 can
00:03:08.890 do

00:03:08.950 this
00:03:09.070 ahead
00:03:09.220 of
00:03:09.340 time
00:03:09.610 but
00:03:09.790 what
00:03:09.970 I
00:03:10.000 usually
00:03:10.060 do

00:03:10.510 is
00:03:10.690 I
00:03:10.840 do
00:03:11.260 this
00:03:11.470 before
00:03:11.739 I
00:03:11.950 start
00:03:12.220 cutting
00:03:12.520 my

00:03:12.550 vegetables
00:03:13.180 and
00:03:13.270 by
00:03:13.420 the
00:03:13.480 time
00:03:13.720 I'm
00:03:13.870 ready
00:03:13.900 to

00:03:14.230 cook
00:03:14.410 then
00:03:14.950 it'll
00:03:15.310 be
00:03:15.400 ready
00:03:15.850 to
00:03:16.180 go
00:03:16.209 so

00:03:16.930 there's
00:03:17.530 that
00:03:17.799 and
00:03:18.160 then
00:03:18.880 finally
00:03:19.390 the
00:03:19.720 rice

00:03:19.930 of
00:03:20.260 course
00:03:20.500 the
00:03:20.709 rice
00:03:20.890 so
00:03:21.400 I've
00:03:21.519 got
00:03:21.700 some
00:03:22.019 300

00:03:23.019 grams
00:03:23.200 of
00:03:23.470 rice
00:03:23.860 here
00:03:24.370 in
00:03:24.489 my
00:03:24.760 pineapple
00:03:25.299 fried

00:03:25.480 rice
00:03:25.540 episode
00:03:26.320 I
00:03:26.500 talked
00:03:26.860 about
00:03:27.220 five
00:03:27.730 tips

00:03:28.239 for
00:03:28.480 cooking
00:03:28.930 rice
00:03:29.350 specifically
00:03:30.160 for
00:03:30.400 fried

00:03:30.730 rice
00:03:30.760 if
00:03:31.360 you've
00:03:31.780 got
00:03:31.959 leftover
00:03:32.500 rice
00:03:32.650 that's

00:03:32.950 great
00:03:33.310 in
00:03:33.549 this
00:03:34.120 dish
00:03:34.480 it's
00:03:34.780 particularly

00:03:35.370 important
00:03:36.370 that
00:03:36.580 your
00:03:37.180 rice
00:03:37.450 was
00:03:37.840 not
00:03:38.049 cooked

00:03:38.440 with
00:03:38.680 too
00:03:38.890 much
00:03:39.040 water
00:03:39.370 and
00:03:39.549 it's
00:03:39.700 not
00:03:39.850 too

00:03:40.060 soft
00:03:40.360 because
00:03:41.019 there
00:03:41.170 is
00:03:41.350 coconut
00:03:41.920 milk
00:03:41.950 so

00:03:42.370 our
00:03:42.640 fried
00:03:43.239 rice
00:03:43.510 sauce
00:03:43.930 is
00:03:44.320 going
00:03:44.680 to
00:03:44.739 be
00:03:44.860 a

00:03:44.890 little
00:03:45.100 bit
00:03:45.250 wetter
00:03:45.700 than
00:03:46.060 normal
00:03:46.290 so
00:03:47.290 you

00:03:48.190 know
00:03:48.280 something
00:03:48.549 to
00:03:48.820 think
00:03:49.030 about
00:03:49.239 if
00:03:49.390 the

00:03:49.510 rice
00:03:49.690 is
00:03:49.720 already
00:03:50.290 on
00:03:50.470 the
00:03:50.709 verge
00:03:50.890 of
00:03:51.100 being

00:03:51.610 soft
00:03:52.060 it
00:03:52.299 might
00:03:52.510 get
00:03:52.720 a
00:03:52.780 little
00:03:52.870 mushy
00:03:53.320 so
00:03:53.860 you

00:03:54.340 can
00:03:54.489 also
00:03:54.670 just
00:03:54.850 put
00:03:55.180 it
00:03:55.299 in
00:03:55.390 the
00:03:55.480 fridge
00:03:55.690 and

00:03:55.720 let
00:03:55.930 it
00:03:56.079 dry
00:03:56.470 out
00:03:56.500 a
00:03:56.799 little
00:03:57.130 bit
00:03:57.370 and
00:03:57.519 then
00:03:58.060 the

00:03:58.570 coconut
00:03:58.750 milk
00:03:59.170 will
00:03:59.320 rehydrate
00:04:00.070 it
00:04:00.220 perfectly

00:04:00.670 so
00:04:01.329 that's
00:04:01.900 all
00:04:02.230 our
00:04:02.440 ingredients
00:04:02.820 let's
00:04:03.820 get

00:04:04.030 cooking
00:04:05.310 all
00:04:06.310 right
00:04:06.519 we're
00:04:06.760 ready
00:04:06.940 to
00:04:07.269 cook

00:04:07.480 I've
00:04:07.660 got
00:04:07.810 my
00:04:07.959 wok
00:04:08.230 here
00:04:08.560 I'm
00:04:08.650 going
00:04:08.769 to
00:04:08.860 heat

00:04:09.130 it
00:04:09.160 on
00:04:09.489 just
00:04:09.970 sort
00:04:10.090 of
00:04:10.209 medium
00:04:10.690 heat
00:04:11.019 when
00:04:11.680 you

00:04:11.709 saute
00:04:12.340 curry
00:04:12.579 paste
00:04:12.880 you
00:04:13.000 do
00:04:13.180 not
00:04:13.329 want
00:04:13.630 to

00:04:13.720 start
00:04:13.930 it
00:04:14.110 in
00:04:14.260 too
00:04:14.890 hot
00:04:15.280 of
00:04:15.549 a
00:04:16.120 pan
00:04:16.390 because
00:04:16.720 you

00:04:16.959 can
00:04:17.620 burn
00:04:18.280 the
00:04:18.519 curry
00:04:18.700 paste
00:04:18.910 instantly
00:04:19.630 if

00:04:20.169 you
00:04:20.260 think
00:04:20.440 about
00:04:20.530 it
00:04:20.739 curry
00:04:20.919 paste
00:04:21.160 is
00:04:21.340 just

00:04:21.520 herbs
00:04:21.849 that
00:04:22.180 I'm
00:04:22.300 tiny
00:04:22.990 tiny
00:04:23.500 pieces
00:04:23.860 so
00:04:24.280 they

00:04:24.760 can
00:04:25.000 burn
00:04:25.270 easily
00:04:25.510 so
00:04:25.810 just
00:04:26.020 a
00:04:26.080 little
00:04:26.229 bit
00:04:26.410 of

00:04:26.860 vegetable
00:04:27.430 oil
00:04:27.610 in
00:04:27.879 there
00:04:28.060 I'm

00:04:29.830 paste
00:04:30.069 I'm
00:04:30.250 not
00:04:30.490 going
00:04:30.789 to

00:04:30.939 wait
00:04:31.090 for
00:04:31.270 the
00:04:31.330 oil
00:04:31.360 to
00:04:31.659 heat
00:04:31.689 up
00:04:31.919 because
00:04:33.210 it's

00:04:34.210 okay
00:04:34.599 for
00:04:34.659 the

00:04:36.099 it's
00:04:36.610 an
00:04:36.789 easier
