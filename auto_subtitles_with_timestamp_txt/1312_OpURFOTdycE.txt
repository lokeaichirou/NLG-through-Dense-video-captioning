00:05:52.080 the
00:05:52.710 vegetables
00:05:53.160 so

00:05:53.910 that
00:05:54.800 there's
00:05:55.800 enough
00:05:56.070 liquid
00:05:56.310 so
00:05:57.000 what
00:05:57.180 we're

00:05:57.300 going
00:05:57.390 to
00:05:57.540 do
00:05:57.750 is
00:05:57.930 mix
00:05:58.229 it
00:05:58.380 now
00:05:58.560 with
00:05:59.160 your

00:05:59.280 hands
00:05:59.520 and
00:05:59.729 gives
00:05:59.910 it
00:06:00.000 a
00:06:00.060 really
00:06:00.360 good
00:06:00.780 mix
00:06:01.020 and

00:06:01.350 in
00:06:02.160 about
00:06:02.370 a
00:06:02.430 half
00:06:02.729 an
00:06:02.880 hour
00:06:03.060 this
00:06:03.750 should
00:06:03.990 be

00:06:04.140 juicy
00:06:04.680 enough
00:06:04.919 so
00:06:05.190 that
00:06:05.340 when
00:06:05.550 we
00:06:05.669 put
00:06:05.940 it
00:06:06.030 into

00:06:06.680 the
00:06:07.680 glass
00:06:07.919 container
00:06:08.250 there
00:06:09.090 will
00:06:09.210 be
00:06:09.240 enough

00:06:09.600 juices
00:06:10.260 from
00:06:10.680 the
00:06:10.740 vegetables
00:06:10.919 to
00:06:11.610 cover
00:06:12.830 the

00:06:13.830 vegetables
00:06:14.310 so
00:06:14.550 you
00:06:14.700 want
00:06:14.850 a
00:06:14.880 little
00:06:15.120 bit
00:06:15.270 of

00:06:15.330 liquid
00:06:15.600 rising
00:06:16.200 above
00:06:16.500 which
00:06:17.160 is
00:06:17.280 why
00:06:17.490 we're

00:06:17.700 going
00:06:17.850 to
00:06:17.910 wait
00:06:18.090 it
00:06:18.270 down
00:06:18.450 and
00:06:18.720 push
00:06:19.020 with
00:06:19.229 the

00:06:19.380 plate
00:06:19.620 so
00:06:19.830 that
00:06:19.890 the
00:06:20.070 juices
00:06:20.460 stay
00:06:20.700 on
00:06:20.850 top
00:06:21.150 so

00:06:21.419 it
00:06:21.540 stays
00:06:21.750 moist
00:06:22.050 and
00:06:22.470 the
00:06:22.919 premise
00:06:23.160 is
00:06:23.550 is

00:06:23.760 that
00:06:24.200 the
00:06:25.200 vegetables
00:06:25.770 are
00:06:25.860 going
00:06:26.010 to
00:06:26.070 forget

00:06:26.460 and
00:06:26.820 their
00:06:27.120 sugars
00:06:27.540 and
00:06:27.690 the
00:06:27.750 vegetables
00:06:28.200 are

00:06:28.290 going
00:06:28.470 to
00:06:28.560 start
00:06:28.770 digesting
00:06:29.400 themselves
00:06:30.000 so

00:06:30.510 that
00:06:30.690 the
00:06:31.110 digestive
00:06:31.710 enzymes
00:06:32.280 are
00:06:32.610 in
00:06:32.850 play

00:06:33.180 so
00:06:33.660 we
00:06:33.870 don't
00:06:34.020 have
00:06:34.169 to
00:06:34.320 work
00:06:34.500 so
00:06:34.740 hard
00:06:34.770 our

00:06:35.190 body
00:06:35.430 doesn't
00:06:35.700 have
00:06:35.940 to
00:06:36.090 use
00:06:36.270 its
00:06:36.450 own

00:06:37.529 times
00:06:37.769 to
00:06:38.429 work
00:06:38.609 to
00:06:38.819 digest
00:06:39.269 it
00:06:39.629 so
00:06:40.049 it's
00:06:40.409 easy

00:06:40.649 to
00:06:40.739 digest
00:06:41.009 and
00:06:41.519 it's
00:06:41.669 healthy
00:06:42.209 flora
00:06:42.769 so

00:06:43.789 there

00:08:27.779 twenty
00:08:28.759 minutes
00:08:29.759 into
00:08:29.969 the
00:08:30.149 process
00:08:30.689 from
00:08:31.049 the

00:08:31.229 time

00:08:49.470 raw

00:08:49.740 foodist

00:08:51.540 so
00:08:51.749 much

00:08:51.870 money
00:08:52.110 so
00:08:52.379 we're
00:08:52.769 really
00:08:52.949 conscious
00:08:53.519 about

00:08:53.610 giving
00:08:54.089 you
00:08:54.149 some
00:08:54.360 recipes

00:08:55.490 affordable
00:08:56.490 and
00:08:56.699 accessible
00:08:56.910 so
00:08:57.839 I'm
00:08:58.019 placing

00:08:58.259 this
00:08:58.709 right
00:08:58.980 in
00:08:59.220 here
00:08:59.550 okay
00:09:02.569 and
00:09:03.569 I'm
00:09:03.990 going
00:09:04.139 to

00:09:04.199 press
00:09:04.470 it
00:09:04.499 down
00:09:04.800 so
00:09:05.189 that
00:09:05.339 the
00:09:05.459 juices
00:09:05.910 cover

00:09:06.240 the
00:09:06.449 vegetables
00:09:06.990 and
00:09:07.790 then
00:09:08.790 you
00:09:08.939 weight
00:09:09.180 it

00:09:09.209 with
00:09:10.079 a
00:09:10.110 clean
00:09:10.680 large
00:09:11.160 clean
00:09:11.550 stone
00:09:11.970 or
00:09:12.569 a

00:09:12.629 mason
00:09:13.259 jar
00:09:13.290 filled
00:09:13.649 with
00:09:13.889 water
00:09:14.129 and
00:09:14.879 it
00:09:15.120 press

00:09:16.079 let
00:09:16.740 everything's
00:09:17.309 really
00:09:17.490 covered
00:09:17.939 with
00:09:18.120 its

00:09:18.300 juices
00:09:18.889 so
00:09:19.889 we
00:09:19.980 can
00:09:20.160 begin
00:09:20.309 to
00:09:20.600 digest
00:09:21.600 itself

00:09:22.100 yeah
00:09:23.100 and
00:09:23.430 then
00:09:24.319 ideally
00:09:25.319 I
00:09:25.350 think
00:09:25.709 that
00:09:25.829 the

00:09:25.949 jar
00:09:26.220 would
00:09:26.399 be
00:09:26.550 a
00:09:26.579 little
00:09:26.850 bit
00:09:26.970 lower
00:09:27.149 we
00:09:27.389 could

00:09:27.540 have
00:09:27.629 filled
00:09:27.809 it
00:09:27.930 a
00:09:28.050 little
00:09:28.589 bit
00:09:28.709 less
00:09:28.920 but
00:09:29.160 you

00:09:29.279 cover
00:09:29.550 it
00:09:29.699 with
00:09:29.730 a
00:09:29.819 towel
00:09:30.149 and
00:09:30.959 there
00:09:31.110 you
00:09:31.199 go

00:09:31.589 and
00:09:31.680 then
00:09:31.889 in
00:09:32.009 about
00:09:32.220 four
00:09:32.459 days
00:09:32.490 it'll
00:09:32.939 smell

00:09:33.269 really
00:09:33.420 funky
00:09:34.199 and
00:09:34.230 it'd
00:09:35.189 be
00:09:35.339 really
00:09:35.639 good
00:09:35.850 for
