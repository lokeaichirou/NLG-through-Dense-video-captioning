00:00:01.500 back
00:00:01.620 to
00:00:01.800 the
00:00:01.860 kitchen

00:00:02.639 I'm
00:00:02.909 here
00:00:03.149 on
00:00:03.300 my
00:00:03.480 own
00:00:03.510 like
00:00:03.959 it's

00:00:04.140 not
00:00:04.290 here
00:00:04.470 but
00:00:04.950 I'm
00:00:05.279 doing
00:00:05.670 a
00:00:05.730 very
00:00:05.910 exciting

00:00:06.299 recipe
00:00:06.600 today
00:00:06.750 a
00:00:06.839 lot
00:00:07.140 of
00:00:07.170 you
00:00:07.410 have
00:00:07.859 been

00:00:08.010 asking
00:00:08.429 for
00:00:08.540 traditional
00:00:09.540 homemade
00:00:10.139 fish
00:00:10.650 and

00:00:10.860 chips
00:00:15.170 so
00:00:16.170 we're
00:00:16.379 gonna
00:00:16.470 start
00:00:16.770 off
00:00:17.010 with
00:00:17.220 the

00:00:17.789 chips
00:00:18.119 we're
00:00:18.510 using
00:00:18.660 Maris
00:00:19.170 Piper
00:00:19.439 potatoes

00:00:20.340 today
00:00:20.490 because
00:00:20.850 apparently
00:00:21.480 they
00:00:22.380 go
00:00:23.070 squishy

00:00:23.910 in
00:00:24.090 the
00:00:24.210 middle
00:00:24.449 and
00:00:24.600 then
00:00:24.689 fluffy
00:00:25.080 and
00:00:25.199 nice

00:00:25.350 and
00:00:25.680 crispy
00:00:26.039 on
00:00:26.070 the
00:00:26.160 outside

00:00:26.730 chips
00:00:27.000 are
00:00:27.300 probably
00:00:27.900 one
00:00:28.109 of
00:00:28.140 my
00:00:28.320 favorite

00:00:28.650 things
00:00:28.830 ever
00:00:29.070 but
00:00:29.699 I
00:00:29.849 always
00:00:30.060 feel
00:00:30.330 guilty

00:00:30.449 about
00:00:30.720 eating
00:00:30.840 chip
00:00:31.230 shop
00:00:31.439 chips
00:00:31.650 because

00:00:31.890 they
00:00:32.040 are
00:00:32.309 fried
00:00:32.579 so
00:00:33.420 today
00:00:33.750 we
00:00:34.110 are
00:00:34.140 going
00:00:34.770 to

00:00:34.860 be
00:00:34.950 baking
00:00:35.399 them
00:00:35.550 I
00:00:35.760 always
00:00:36.300 have
00:00:36.750 couples

00:00:37.170 with
00:00:37.380 my
00:00:37.469 fish
00:00:37.649 and
00:00:37.680 chips
00:00:37.950 and
00:00:38.250 now
00:00:38.790 they're

00:00:39.540 hard
00:00:39.809 to
00:00:39.989 find
00:00:40.230 chip
00:00:40.920 shops
00:00:41.160 do
00:00:41.370 not
00:00:41.579 stock

00:00:41.969 cockles
00:00:42.570 anymore

00:00:43.340 if
00:00:44.340 Mike
00:00:44.670 had
00:00:44.700 his
00:00:45.059 way
00:00:45.239 I
00:00:45.270 think
00:00:45.629 we'd

00:00:45.750 probably
00:00:45.780 have
00:00:46.289 fish
00:00:46.469 and
00:00:46.500 chips
00:00:46.649 takeaway

00:00:47.190 once
00:00:47.730 a
00:00:47.910 week

00:00:48.360 however
00:00:48.660 it's
00:00:48.989 usually
00:00:49.170 more
00:00:49.469 like
00:00:49.829 once

00:00:50.190 every
00:00:50.460 couple
00:00:50.730 of
00:00:50.760 months
00:00:50.879 but
00:00:51.300 if
00:00:51.780 it
00:00:51.930 works

00:00:52.110 out
00:00:52.289 well
00:00:52.440 cooking
00:00:52.800 at
00:00:52.920 home
00:00:53.039 you
00:00:53.280 never
00:00:53.399 know

00:00:53.610 maybe
00:00:53.820 we
00:00:53.969 can
00:00:54.120 start
00:00:54.329 doing
00:00:54.750 at
00:00:54.840 home
00:00:54.960 surf

00:00:55.320 game
00:00:55.500 take
00:00:55.710 away

00:01:00.530 so
00:01:01.530 now
00:01:01.650 we're
00:01:01.860 gonna
00:01:01.980 pop
00:01:02.220 them
00:01:02.340 in
00:01:02.400 the
00:01:02.460 oven

00:01:02.610 for
00:01:02.940 about
00:01:03.030 40
00:01:03.480 minutes
00:01:03.630 to
00:01:03.870 bake
00:01:06.560 now
00:01:07.560 time

00:01:07.860 for
00:01:07.890 the
00:01:08.100 fish
00:01:08.340 we
00:01:08.880 are
00:01:09.270 actually
00:01:09.780 using
00:01:10.350 coal

00:01:10.620 each
00:01:10.830 day
00:01:11.040 instead
00:01:11.340 of
00:01:11.400 cod
00:01:11.610 because
00:01:11.790 it's

00:01:12.030 more
00:01:12.360 sustainable
00:01:12.740 what
00:01:13.740 we're
00:01:13.830 gonna
00:01:13.920 do

00:01:14.070 first
00:01:14.280 is
00:01:14.640 make
00:01:14.670 the
00:01:15.090 batter
00:01:15.390 and
00:01:15.720 we're
00:01:15.870 using

00:01:16.110 lager
00:01:18.170 so
00:01:19.170 whilst
00:01:19.380 the
00:01:19.500 oils
00:01:19.800 heating
00:01:20.070 up
00:01:20.160 I'm

00:01:20.310 just
00:01:20.340 going
00:01:20.550 to
00:01:20.640 sift
00:01:21.000 in
00:01:22.010 225
00:01:23.010 grams
00:01:23.220 of

00:01:23.460 self-raising
00:01:23.790 flour
00:01:23.940 I
00:01:28.520 hate
00:01:29.520 beer
00:01:29.729 but
00:01:30.270 beer

00:01:30.300 battered
00:01:31.080 fish
00:01:31.290 always
00:01:31.920 tastes
00:01:32.430 cats

00:01:34.750 we're
00:01:35.750 going
00:01:35.930 to
00:01:36.020 prepare
00:01:36.170 the
00:01:36.290 fish
00:01:36.620 what

00:01:37.159 we're
00:01:37.250 gonna
00:01:37.340 do
00:01:37.460 first
00:01:37.670 is
00:01:38.090 pop
00:01:38.360 a
00:01:38.510 little
00:01:38.720 bit

00:01:38.900 of
00:01:39.140 flour
00:01:39.800 give
00:01:40.430 it
00:01:40.520 a
00:01:40.580 bit
00:01:40.700 of
00:01:40.760 a
00:01:40.790 dusting
00:01:41.290 on

00:01:42.290 both
00:01:42.710 sides
00:01:43.010 I
00:01:43.400 think
00:01:43.640 this
00:01:43.970 just
00:01:44.120 helps
00:01:44.300 the

00:01:44.540 batter
00:01:44.750 to
00:01:45.080 stick
00:01:45.110 to
00:01:45.440 the
00:01:45.530 fish
00:01:45.710 because

00:01:46.040 otherwise
00:01:46.280 it
00:01:46.490 may
00:01:46.580 be
00:01:46.640 it's
00:01:46.790 slimy

00:01:47.180 I'm
00:01:47.450 gonna
00:01:47.660 put
00:01:47.930 a
00:01:47.960 little
00:01:48.080 bit
00:01:48.260 of
00:01:48.320 salt

00:01:48.500 pepper
00:01:48.650 on

00:01:53.299 so
00:01:54.079 now
00:01:54.200 it's
00:01:54.380 on
00:01:54.500 the
00:01:54.560 fish
00:01:54.799 we
00:01:55.399 need
00:01:55.429 to
00:01:55.670 test

00:01:55.969 that
00:01:56.119 the
00:01:56.270 oil
00:01:56.479 is
00:01:56.719 hot
00:01:56.899 enough
00:01:57.109 you
00:01:57.500 must
00:01:57.740 be

00:01:57.859 very
00:01:58.070 very
00:01:58.189 careful
00:01:58.729 with

00:01:59.960 want
00:02:00.170 to
00:02:00.229 take

00:02:00.530 little
00:02:00.770 bit
00:02:01.159 of
00:02:01.399 bread
00:02:01.670 and

00:02:01.969 you
00:02:02.270 want
00:02:02.420 to
00:02:02.479 pop
