00:03:14.010 in

00:03:27.680 what
00:03:27.799 we're
00:03:27.920 looking
00:03:27.950 for

00:03:30.379 fluffy
00:03:30.769 texture
00:03:31.340 what
00:03:31.489 we

00:03:31.610 don't

00:03:51.970 mashed

00:03:52.970 potato
00:03:58.720 and
00:03:59.720 to
00:03:59.989 finish
00:04:00.260 that
00:04:00.440 off
00:04:01.209 I'm
