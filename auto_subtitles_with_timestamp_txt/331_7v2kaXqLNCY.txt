00:01:24.350 in
00:01:24.530 a
00:01:24.650 bowl
00:01:25.159 so

00:01:51.799 to

00:01:51.979 it
00:01:52.130 this
00:01:52.760 is
00:01:52.820 basically
00:01:53.090 to
00:01:53.630 seal
00:01:53.900 the
00:01:54.080 samosa

00:01:54.500 parties
00:01:54.860 that
00:01:55.010 you
00:01:55.130 are
00:01:55.190 going
00:01:55.369 to

00:01:55.850 there

00:01:56.330 are
00:01:56.420 little
00:01:56.690 bit

00:02:00.619 well
00:02:01.060 if
00:02:02.060 you
00:02:02.180 feel
00:02:02.420 that

00:02:02.450 the
00:02:03.110 water
00:02:03.290 is
00:02:03.500 less
00:02:03.680 you

00:02:04.760 some
00:02:05.030 more
00:02:05.210 water
00:02:05.330 but
00:02:05.990 I

00:02:38.900 time
00:02:38.960 that
00:02:39.680 is

00:02:39.830 why
00:02:39.980 I

00:03:01.190 nicely
00:03:01.490 this
00:03:02.120 is

00:03:02.270 basically
00:03:02.660 done
00:03:03.020 to
00:03:03.890 allow
00:03:04.880 the
