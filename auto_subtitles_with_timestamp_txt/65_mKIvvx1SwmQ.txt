00:02:14.360 them
00:02:14.540 in
00:02:14.690 straight
00:02:15.020 if

00:02:15.170 you're
00:02:15.350 amateur
00:02:15.950 but
00:02:16.130 I
00:02:16.280 fall
00:02:16.550 mining
00:02:17.090 at
00:02:17.330 a

00:02:17.360 triangular
00:02:18.140 angle
00:02:18.650 and

00:02:21.770 way
00:02:21.920 towards
00:02:22.520 the
00:02:22.640 other
00:02:22.910 side
00:02:23.080 opposite
00:02:24.080 of

00:02:25.190 we
00:02:25.250 can
00:02:25.640 eat
00:02:25.910 it
00:02:26.030 despite
00:02:26.450 my

00:02:26.600 preconceived
00:02:27.230 notions
00:02:27.860 it
00:02:28.130 actually
00:02:28.850 tastes

00:02:29.660 I
00:02:30.050 thought
00:02:30.500 I
00:02:30.560 would
00:02:30.830 take
00:02:31.040 one
00:02:31.459 bite
00:02:31.760 and
00:02:32.060 just

00:02:32.360 start
00:02:32.630 to
00:02:32.810 involuntarily
00:02:33.650 gag
00:02:34.190 but
00:02:34.790 I'd

00:02:35.269 merely
00:02:35.690 took
00:02:36.050 a
00:02:36.140 second
00:02:36.530 bite
00:02:36.709 it
00:02:37.010 was
00:02:37.190 really

00:02:37.489 good
00:02:37.700 the
00:02:37.910 diet
00:02:38.150 cheese
00:02:38.480 was
00:02:38.780 pretty
00:02:39.110 good
00:02:39.380 the

00:02:39.860 beans
00:02:40.190 were
00:02:40.400 cooked
00:02:40.430 really
00:02:40.730 well
00:02:41.030 and
00:02:41.510 then
00:02:41.810 I

00:02:41.959 ran
00:02:42.170 into
00:02:42.350 the
00:02:42.590 sriracha
00:02:42.980 sauce
00:02:43.400 now
00:02:43.880 I
00:02:43.910 don't

00:02:44.120 eat
