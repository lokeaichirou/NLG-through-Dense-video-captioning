00:01:22.140 enough

00:01:22.740 make
00:01:22.950 into

00:01:23.370 shapes
00:01:23.640 once
00:01:24.600 the
00:01:24.780 mixture
00:01:24.930 is
00:01:25.320 out
00:01:25.590 of
00:01:25.800 the

00:01:25.920 fridge
00:01:26.160 heat
00:01:26.820 the
00:01:26.850 pan
00:01:27.060 take
00:01:27.720 a
00:01:27.750 small
00:01:28.050 amount

00:01:28.440 of
00:01:28.590 the
00:01:28.770 mixture
00:01:29.250 in
00:01:29.700 your
00:01:30.000 palm
00:01:30.240 and
00:01:30.450 try
00:01:31.050 to

00:01:31.110 make
00:01:31.410 a
00:01:31.440 patty
00:01:31.740 out
00:01:31.979 of
00:01:32.220 it
00:01:32.400 now
00:01:33.000 spread
00:01:33.360 butter

00:01:33.630 on
00:01:33.750 the
00:01:33.990 non-stick
00:01:34.410 pan
00:01:34.970 and
00:01:36.770 place
00:01:37.770 it
00:01:38.040 over

00:01:38.160 it
00:01:40.280 now
00:01:41.280 repeat
00:01:41.610 the
00:01:41.790 process
00:01:41.970 for
00:01:42.390 the
00:01:42.540 rest

00:01:42.780 of
00:01:42.930 the
00:01:43.080 mixture
00:01:43.229 and
00:01:43.680 keep
00:01:44.130 it
00:01:44.280 on
00:01:44.430 a
00:01:44.460 medium

00:01:44.880 flame
00:01:44.910 because
00:01:45.660 we
00:01:45.780 don't
00:01:46.020 want
00:01:46.229 our
00:01:46.410 potato

00:01:46.740 to
00:01:47.009 become
00:01:47.310 Brown
00:01:47.520 very
00:01:47.820 fast
00:01:48.119 because
00:01:48.570 it
00:01:48.690 is

00:01:48.840 very
00:01:48.869 raw
00:01:49.350 so
00:01:49.650 it
00:01:49.830 needs
00:01:50.100 some
00:01:50.369 time
00:01:50.640 to
00:01:51.000 be

00:01:51.119 cooked
00:01:51.360 from
00:01:51.540 inside
00:01:51.930 you
00:01:52.200 can
00:01:52.380 also
00:01:52.530 do
00:01:52.830 this

00:01:53.040 recipe
00:01:53.490 with
00:01:53.759 power
00:01:54.000 boil
00:01:54.270 potatoes
00:01:54.420 but
00:01:55.140 I

00:01:55.290 personally
00:01:55.770 like
00:01:55.979 to
00:01:56.009 use
00:01:56.220 the
00:01:56.550 raw
00:01:56.729 potatoes

00:01:57.240 because
00:01:57.509 it
00:01:57.780 gives
00:01:57.960 a
00:01:58.140 very
00:01:58.259 different

00:01:58.770 texture
00:02:02.030 if
00:02:03.030 your
00:02:03.330 little
00:02:03.450 calorie
00:02:03.960 conscious

00:02:04.200 just
00:02:05.160 drizzle
00:02:05.490 some
00:02:05.520 olive
00:02:05.670 oil
00:02:06.090 on
00:02:06.300 it
00:02:06.330 now

00:02:07.170 you
00:02:07.229 can
00:02:07.410 just
00:02:07.649 check

00:02:12.300 takes
00:02:12.570 almost
00:02:12.780 three
00:02:13.080 to

00:02:13.410 four

00:02:17.970 with
