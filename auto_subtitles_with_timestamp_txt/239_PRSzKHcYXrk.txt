00:02:03.659 we're
00:02:04.140 ready
00:02:04.320 what

00:02:04.649 we're
00:02:04.799 almost
00:02:04.950 ready
00:02:05.280 to

00:02:07.920 what
00:02:08.069 you
00:02:08.190 don't
00:02:08.340 have
00:02:08.550 to
00:02:08.700 do

00:02:08.819 sometimes
00:02:09.119 I
00:02:09.390 put
00:02:09.569 in

00:02:10.009 sometimes
00:02:10.940 I
00:02:11.090 don't
00:02:11.150 it's
00:02:11.659 not
00:02:11.870 going
00:02:12.019 to
00:02:12.080 be

00:02:12.140 the
00:02:12.230 end
00:02:12.379 of
00:02:12.470 the
00:02:12.560 world
00:02:12.800 either
00:02:13.099 which
00:02:13.340 way
00:02:13.370 in

00:02:13.819 this
00:02:14.540 case
00:02:14.810 though
00:02:15.019 it
00:02:15.170 kind
00:02:15.530 of
00:02:15.650 I
00:02:15.739 think

00:02:15.799 liquefied
00:02:16.760 it
00:02:16.909 a
00:02:16.940 little
00:02:17.120 bit
00:02:17.269 more
00:02:17.540 so
00:02:18.200 that

00:02:18.230 it
00:02:18.500 wasn't
00:02:18.680 as
00:02:18.920 dry
00:02:19.190 so
00:02:20.000 you
00:02:20.090 know
00:02:20.209 just
00:02:20.360 kind

00:02:20.599 of
00:02:20.659 gauge
00:02:20.870 that
00:02:21.140 and
00:02:21.440 whether
00:02:21.709 or
00:02:21.860 not
00:02:21.920 you
00:02:22.040 got

00:02:22.190 a
00:02:22.220 lemon
00:02:22.430 now
00:02:23.420 I'm

00:02:25.489 mount
00:02:25.640 it
00:02:25.849 on

00:02:25.970 there
00:02:26.120 each
00:02:26.540 one
00:02:26.810 of
00:02:26.900 these
00:02:26.959 is
00:02:27.170 going
00:02:27.290 to

00:02:27.500 about
00:02:27.769 two
00:02:28.040 tablespoons
00:02:28.489 because
00:02:29.450 it's

00:02:29.690 heaping
00:02:30.140 tablespoon
00:02:30.319 that
00:02:30.950 I'm
00:02:31.040 using
00:02:31.250 to

00:02:31.549 measure
00:02:31.730 this
00:02:32.000 I'm

00:02:32.299 get
00:02:32.480 10
00:02:32.750 out
00:02:33.500 of

00:02:33.830 kin
00:02:34.069 which
00:02:34.310 I
00:02:34.430 usually
00:02:34.610 get
00:02:35.000 you
00:02:35.599 know
00:02:35.720 if

00:02:36.079 you
00:02:36.230 want
00:02:36.440 you
00:02:36.530 can
00:02:36.650 just
00:02:36.829 double
00:02:37.129 up
00:02:37.220 the
00:02:37.250 size

00:02:37.519 and
00:02:37.730 make
00:02:37.819 five
00:02:38.060 but
00:02:38.329 I
00:02:38.360 make
00:02:38.540 the
00:02:38.690 I

00:02:39.920 ones
00:02:40.280 that
00:02:40.790 will

00:02:40.909 go
00:02:41.060 on
00:02:41.120 a
00:02:41.209 piece
00:02:41.390 of
00:02:41.540 pita
00:02:41.720 bread
00:02:41.989 for
00:02:42.170 a

00:02:42.260 falafel
00:02:42.620 sandwich
00:02:42.980 you

00:02:43.610 so
00:02:44.569 they're

00:02:44.750 yharnam
00:02:45.200 slide
00:02:45.470 it
00:02:45.650 in
00:02:45.860 the
00:02:46.129 fridge
00:02:46.430 you

00:02:47.900 a
00:02:48.140 little
00:02:48.170 while

00:02:48.349 because
00:02:48.890 they'll
00:02:49.160 bake
00:02:49.370 up
00:02:49.579 better
00:02:49.819 they

00:02:51.950 you
00:02:52.129 don't
00:02:52.280 have

00:02:58.190 have

00:02:58.310 a
00:02:58.340 brush
00:02:58.609 because
00:02:58.730 we
