00:02:11.830 but
00:02:12.070 uh
00:02:12.100 it

00:02:12.970 is
00:02:13.030 worth
00:02:13.300 noting
00:02:13.690 this
00:02:13.810 ham
00:02:14.020 doesn't
00:02:14.350 need
00:02:14.440 to

00:02:14.560 be
00:02:14.650 super
00:02:14.860 special

00:02:18.850 slices
00:02:19.180 we
00:02:19.660 get
00:02:19.930 but

00:02:21.340 any
00:02:21.880 ham
00:02:22.270 slices
00:02:22.540 will
00:02:22.870 do
00:02:23.020 whatsoever
00:02:23.680 so

00:02:24.580 this
00:02:24.880 is
00:02:25.090 what
00:02:25.240 the

00:02:25.990 looks

00:02:26.350 like
00:02:26.560 and
00:02:28.320 just
00:02:29.320 look
00:02:29.560 for
00:02:29.830 the
00:02:29.920 ramen
00:02:30.100 package

00:02:30.670 that

00:02:33.700 what
00:02:33.970 you're

00:02:34.060 looking
00:02:34.420 for
00:02:34.660 now
00:02:35.260 we
00:02:35.320 have
00:02:35.590 boiling
00:02:35.860 water

00:02:36.340 and

00:02:37.150 take
00:02:37.420 the
00:02:37.540 ramen
00:02:37.810 noodles

00:02:40.330 you
00:02:40.780 just

00:02:40.930 kind
00:02:41.200 of
00:02:41.290 mix
00:02:41.470 it
00:02:41.560 around
00:02:41.700 ramen
00:02:42.700 noodles

00:02:43.000 definitely
00:02:43.450 read
00:02:43.600 the
00:02:43.720 package
00:02:44.140 but

00:02:44.350 typically
00:02:45.060 especially
00:02:46.060 for
00:02:46.270 the
00:02:46.360 chilled

00:02:46.660 ones
00:02:46.900 these
00:02:47.230 aren't

00:02:52.959 two
00:02:53.230 minutes
00:02:53.620 three
00:02:53.860 minutes
00:02:54.250 max
00:02:54.430 now
00:02:55.240 we're

00:02:55.390 going
00:02:55.480 to
00:02:55.540 go

00:02:55.900 and
00:02:56.050 mix
00:02:56.200 them
00:02:56.500 in
