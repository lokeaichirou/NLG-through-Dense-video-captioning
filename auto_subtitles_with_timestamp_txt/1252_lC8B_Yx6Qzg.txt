00:03:46.120 fresh
00:03:46.360 mint
00:03:46.660 and
00:03:47.250 then
00:03:48.250 we're
00:03:48.370 gonna
00:03:48.459 throw
00:03:48.549 in

00:03:49.090 some
00:03:49.630 pita
00:03:50.079 chips
00:03:50.350 so
00:03:51.040 I
00:03:51.430 have
00:03:51.549 a
00:03:51.579 whole
00:03:51.850 wheat

00:03:52.030 pita
00:03:52.209 chip
00:03:52.570 that
00:03:53.140 you
00:03:53.260 just
00:03:53.500 toast
00:03:53.829 in
00:03:54.130 your

00:03:54.280 oven
00:03:54.549 you
00:03:54.760 can
00:03:55.090 also
00:03:55.299 buy
00:03:55.540 them
00:03:55.690 in
00:03:55.810 a
00:03:55.870 bag
00:03:56.049 too

00:03:56.410 many
00:03:56.560 places
00:03:56.980 sell
00:03:57.370 them
00:03:57.610 and
00:03:57.820 then
00:03:58.660 once
00:03:58.870 you

00:03:59.049 throw
00:03:59.350 in
00:03:59.560 the
00:03:59.590 pita
00:03:59.950 chip
00:04:00.959 you
00:04:01.959 want
00:04:02.110 to
00:04:02.170 take

00:04:02.320 the
00:04:02.440 reserved
00:04:02.860 dressing
00:04:03.760 and
00:04:03.940 pour
00:04:04.390 over
00:04:04.630 the

00:04:05.410 pita
00:04:05.620 chip
00:04:05.860 itself
00:04:06.160 so
00:04:07.120 I
00:04:07.480 think
00:04:07.690 this
00:04:07.870 may
00:04:08.110 be

00:04:08.170 why
00:04:08.470 it's
00:04:08.709 called
00:04:08.920 a
00:04:09.070 peasant
00:04:09.489 salad
00:04:09.880 they

00:04:10.000 would
00:04:10.150 use
00:04:10.329 day-old
00:04:10.870 bread
00:04:11.140 and
00:04:11.910 make
00:04:12.910 it
00:04:13.030 into

00:04:13.209 the
00:04:13.329 salad
00:04:13.750 to
00:04:13.959 create

00:04:15.100 with
00:04:15.459 the

00:04:16.840 want
00:04:17.109 to
