00:00:00.030 and
00:00:00.480 why
00:00:00.659 is
00:00:00.719 this
00:00:01.050 not
00:00:01.230 an

00:00:04.830 a
00:00:04.859 number
00:00:05.100 of

00:00:05.130 reasons
00:00:05.580 first

00:00:12.900 are
00:00:13.049 great
00:00:13.259 one
00:00:13.889 trick
00:00:14.099 I

00:00:14.219 learned
00:00:14.460 from
00:00:14.580 a
00:00:14.849 wonderful
00:00:15.570 Italian

00:00:17.220 that

00:00:17.460 pithy
00:00:18.020 center
00:00:19.130 which
00:00:20.130 is
00:00:20.820 tough
00:00:21.359 and

00:00:32.759 a
00:00:32.790 simple
00:00:33.120 I
