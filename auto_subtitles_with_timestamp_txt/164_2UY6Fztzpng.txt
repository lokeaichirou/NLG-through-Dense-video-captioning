00:01:51.640 thread
00:01:51.850 later

00:01:52.150 on

00:01:57.040 sure

00:01:58.150 coated

00:02:07.890 at

00:02:08.250 least
00:02:08.429 one
00:02:08.759 hour
00:02:08.970 the
00:02:09.690 chicken
00:02:10.019 will
00:02:10.200 benefit

00:02:10.590 from
00:02:10.619 marinating
00:02:11.340 longer
00:02:11.700 if
00:02:11.910 you
00:02:12.090 have
00:02:12.239 time

00:02:12.510 but
00:02:13.290 because
00:02:13.560 of
00:02:13.590 lime
00:02:13.890 juice
00:02:14.129 and
00:02:14.280 vinegar

00:02:14.400 and
00:02:14.640 the
00:02:14.819 marinade
00:02:15.180 we
00:02:15.599 wouldn't
00:02:15.989 recommend

00:02:16.230 marinating
00:02:16.890 it
00:02:16.980 for
00:02:17.190 more
00:02:17.370 than
00:02:17.550 four
00:02:17.790 to
00:02:17.879 five

00:02:18.090 hours
00:02:18.510 when
00:02:19.379 you're
00:02:19.530 ready
00:02:19.739 to
00:02:19.890 cook
00:02:20.069 the

00:02:20.250 chicken
00:02:20.459 preheat
00:02:21.360 the
00:02:21.540 grill
00:02:21.660 from

00:02:21.930 medium-high
00:02:22.530 heat
00:02:23.690 thread
00:02:24.690 the
00:02:24.840 chicken
00:02:25.140 and

00:02:25.290 peppers
00:02:25.410 onto
00:02:26.099 skewers
00:02:26.430 if
00:02:26.819 you're
00:02:27.390 using

00:02:27.629 wooden
00:02:28.019 skewers
00:02:28.470 it's
00:02:28.830 a
00:02:28.920 good
00:02:29.099 idea
00:02:29.190 to
00:02:29.430 soak

00:02:29.700 them
00:02:29.910 in
00:02:29.970 water
00:02:30.209 for
00:02:30.360 30
00:02:30.780 minutes
00:02:31.170 to
00:02:31.349 prevent

00:02:31.650 them
00:02:31.890 from
00:02:31.920 burning
00:02:32.220 on
00:02:32.519 the
00:02:32.640 grill

00:02:43.650 discard
00:02:44.650 the
00:02:44.830 marinade
00:02:45.840 lightly
00:02:46.840 oil
00:02:47.080 the

00:02:47.290 grill
00:02:47.620 grate
00:02:51.120 grill
00:02:52.120 the
00:02:52.270 skewers
00:02:52.390 turning

00:02:53.290 occasionally
00:02:53.640 until
00:02:54.640 the
00:02:54.760 chicken
00:02:55.090 juices

00:02:55.450 run
00:02:55.660 clear
00:02:55.690 for
00:02:56.560 10
00:02:56.800 to
00:02:56.980 15
00:02:57.130 minutes

00:03:08.850 chili
00:03:09.300 lime
00:03:09.570 chicken
00:03:10.020 kebabs
00:03:10.320 so
00:03:10.680 many
00:03:10.920 times

00:03:11.220 I've
00:03:11.490 lost
00:03:11.820 count
00:03:12.090 great
00:03:12.900 on
00:03:13.080 the
00:03:13.200 barbecue
00:03:13.620 or

00:03:13.800 if

00:03:14.160 too
00:03:14.340 cold
00:03:14.550 outside
00:03:14.790 I
00:03:15.240 broiled
00:03:15.810 them
