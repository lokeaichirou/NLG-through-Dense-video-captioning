00:01:32.310 me
00:01:32.400 go

00:01:32.520 ahead

00:01:39.180 cans
00:01:39.630 of

00:01:41.270 preferably
00:01:42.270 fresh
00:01:42.630 clams
00:01:42.990 would
00:01:43.229 be
00:01:43.350 great

00:01:43.590 but
00:01:43.890 I

00:01:44.369 find
00:01:44.520 them
00:01:44.759 anywhere
00:01:44.909 so
