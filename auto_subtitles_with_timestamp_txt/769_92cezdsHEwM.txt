00:03:47.290 bit
00:03:47.410 longer
00:03:47.560 to
00:03:47.800 cook
00:03:47.830 so
00:03:48.250 we're
00:03:48.819 actually

00:03:49.000 going
00:03:49.300 to
00:03:49.360 use
00:03:49.600 some
00:03:49.870 jarred
00:03:50.350 kind
00:03:50.800 of
00:03:50.920 Leaney

00:03:51.100 beans
00:03:51.489 so
00:03:52.239 we're
00:03:52.630 going
00:03:52.720 to
00:03:52.810 add
00:03:52.930 half
00:03:52.959 of

00:03:53.470 these
00:03:53.620 beans

00:03:57.920 and
00:03:58.210 you
00:03:59.210 can
00:03:59.360 always
00:03:59.600 use
00:03:59.810 canned
00:04:00.140 beans
00:04:00.440 -

00:04:00.800 there's
00:04:01.160 nothing
00:04:01.460 wrong
00:04:01.610 with
00:04:01.670 that
00:04:01.940 whatever

00:04:02.450 you
00:04:02.630 have
00:04:10.270 there
00:04:11.270 you
00:04:11.300 go
00:04:12.130 so
00:04:13.130 we
00:04:13.160 got
00:04:13.340 happy

00:04:13.640 beans
00:04:13.970 here
00:04:14.209 what
00:04:14.390 do
00:04:14.450 we
00:04:14.510 deal
00:04:14.690 with
00:04:14.720 these

00:04:14.930 we're
00:04:15.590 going
00:04:15.740 to
00:04:15.800 pureed
00:04:16.160 them
00:04:16.370 and
00:04:16.640 put
00:04:16.880 them

00:04:16.940 put
00:04:17.150 them
00:04:17.450 into
00:04:17.570 soup
00:04:17.840 so
00:04:18.140 that
00:04:18.290 it
00:04:18.380 makes
00:04:18.739 a

00:04:18.950 nice
00:04:19.160 stick
00:04:19.489 soup
00:04:19.760 sounds
00:04:20.209 like
00:04:20.480 a
00:04:20.510 plan
00:04:20.810 and

00:04:21.169 to
00:04:21.620 do
00:04:21.769 this
00:04:21.950 we
00:04:22.220 have
00:04:22.460 our
00:04:22.700 KitchenAid

00:04:23.360 immersion
00:04:24.080 blender
00:04:24.590 this
00:04:25.190 is
00:04:25.280 a
00:04:25.340 really
00:04:25.640 cool

00:04:25.820 tool
00:04:26.060 because
00:04:26.600 it
00:04:26.870 cuts
00:04:27.140 down
00:04:27.320 on
00:04:27.380 cleanup
00:04:27.800 and

00:04:28.280 you
00:04:28.520 just
00:04:28.910 whip
00:04:29.300 it
00:04:29.330 and
00:04:29.720 then
00:04:29.810 whip
00:04:29.960 it
00:04:30.080 out

00:04:30.200 and
00:04:30.500 here
00:04:30.860 we
00:04:30.950 go
00:04:47.740 like
00:04:48.740 a
00:04:48.770 game
00:04:49.240 looks
00:04:50.240 good

00:04:50.840 okay
00:04:51.580 you
00:04:52.580 say
00:04:52.760 so
00:04:55.930 and
00:04:57.820 this
00:04:58.820 is
00:04:59.090 going
00:04:59.360 to

00:04:59.510 thicken
00:05:00.050 our
00:05:00.470 soup
00:05:00.800 really
00:05:01.490 nicely
00:05:03.100 so
00:05:04.100 how

00:05:04.550 often
00:05:04.880 do
00:05:05.090 you
00:05:05.210 make
00:05:05.450 this
00:05:05.690 I
00:05:05.990 mean
00:05:06.110 I
00:05:06.260 know
00:05:06.410 I'm

00:05:06.710 not
00:05:06.860 even
00:05:07.040 from
00:05:07.400 a
00:05:07.640 Bootsie
00:05:08.180 but
00:05:08.390 my
00:05:08.510 family

00:05:08.870 ate
00:05:09.020 this
00:05:09.290 almost
00:05:09.770 once
00:05:10.160 a
00:05:10.310 week
00:05:10.490 in
00:05:10.790 the

00:05:10.850 wintertime
00:05:11.780 at
00:05:12.410 least
00:05:12.710 the
00:05:13.669 same
00:05:13.910 the
00:05:14.330 same

00:05:14.510 with
00:05:14.720 us
00:05:14.900 it's
00:05:15.110 a
00:05:15.229 filling
00:05:15.560 meal
00:05:15.770 and
00:05:16.100 it's
00:05:16.220 a

00:05:16.340 meal
00:05:16.550 in
00:05:16.700 itself
00:05:16.790 you
00:05:17.360 have
00:05:17.390 all
00:05:17.720 of
00:05:17.750 your

00:05:18.580 protein
00:05:19.580 your
00:05:19.760 vegetables
00:05:20.390 are
00:05:20.570 in
00:05:20.720 here
00:05:21.080 and

00:05:21.290 your
00:05:21.500 carbs
00:05:21.979 so
00:05:22.250 you
00:05:22.310 really
00:05:23.090 don't
00:05:23.330 need

00:05:23.419 anything
00:05:23.690 else
00:05:23.979 so
00:05:24.979 what's
00:05:25.190 next
00:05:25.340 we're
00:05:25.790 going

00:05:25.940 to
00:05:26.000 cook
00:05:26.150 the
00:05:26.300 pasta
00:05:26.890 okay
00:05:27.890 and
00:05:28.100 we
00:05:28.580 have
00:05:28.790 some

00:05:29.120 elbow
00:05:29.750 pasta
00:05:30.020 today
00:05:30.770 and
00:05:31.540 this
00:05:32.540 isn't
00:05:32.780 quite

00:05:33.020 the
00:05:33.110 traditional
00:05:33.380 way
00:05:33.830 you
00:05:33.890 you
00:05:34.490 would
00:05:34.640 make

00:05:34.820 it
00:05:34.970 in
00:05:35.120 Pescara
00:05:35.479 what
00:05:36.020 would
00:05:36.140 you
00:05:36.320 use
00:05:36.710 we
00:05:37.160 use

00:05:37.540 homemade
00:05:38.540 egg
00:05:38.720 noodles
00:05:39.460 cut
00:05:40.460 into
00:05:41.229 short

00:05:42.229 strips
00:05:42.650 or
00:05:43.070 a
00:05:43.130 two
00:05:43.760 batiti

00:05:44.440 pasta
00:05:45.440 so
00:05:45.710 we're
00:05:45.860 just
00:05:45.890 gonna
00:05:46.210 put
00:05:47.210 our
00:05:47.240 pasta

00:05:47.510 and
00:05:48.080 get
00:05:48.350 it
00:05:48.470 going

00:05:54.430 so
00:05:55.430 our
00:05:55.580 pastas
00:05:56.000 in
00:05:56.180 and
00:05:56.510 what
00:05:57.230 are
00:05:57.290 we
00:05:57.380 going

00:05:57.500 to
00:05:57.560 add
00:05:57.710 to
00:05:57.980 our
00:05:58.010 we're
00:05:58.550 going
00:05:58.730 to
00:05:58.850 add
00:05:59.030 some

00:05:59.360 hot
00:05:59.510 water
00:05:59.920 to
00:06:00.920 make
00:06:01.280 a
00:06:01.310 soup
00:06:01.610 here
00:06:01.880 to
00:06:02.480 get
00:06:02.630 it

00:06:02.720 ready
00:06:02.840 to
00:06:02.980 for
00:06:03.980 the
00:06:04.070 pasta
00:06:04.600 so
00:06:05.600 we
00:06:06.080 have
00:06:06.320 some

00:06:06.590 hot
00:06:06.800 water
00:06:07.040 set
00:06:07.550 aside
00:06:07.580 you
00:06:08.120 could
00:06:08.270 certainly

00:06:08.480 use
00:06:08.690 some
00:06:09.020 pasta
00:06:09.470 water
00:06:09.500 and
00:06:10.010 if
00:06:10.430 you
00:06:10.580 use

00:06:10.850 pasta
00:06:11.210 water
00:06:11.570 the
00:06:11.960 starch
00:06:12.350 that
00:06:13.010 releases

00:06:13.460 from
00:06:13.580 the
00:06:13.640 pasta
00:06:14.090 will
00:06:14.390 thicken
00:06:14.720 your
00:06:14.990 soup
00:06:15.260 a

00:06:15.470 little
00:06:15.770 bit
00:06:15.920 more
00:06:16.130 so
00:06:16.700 if
00:06:16.820 you
00:06:16.940 like
00:06:17.240 a
00:06:17.480 thicker

00:06:17.720 pasta
00:06:18.200 fagioli
00:06:18.380 you
00:06:18.860 can
00:06:19.010 certainly
00:06:19.340 do
00:06:19.550 that

00:06:19.580 we're
00:06:20.360 going
00:06:20.510 to
00:06:20.570 just
00:06:20.810 use
00:06:20.960 some
00:06:20.990 plain
00:06:21.350 soup

00:06:22.810 we're
00:06:23.810 just
00:06:23.990 going
00:06:24.110 to
00:06:24.140 use
00:06:24.320 some
00:06:24.350 plain
00:06:24.710 water

00:06:25.420 approximately
00:06:26.420 a
00:06:26.780 cup
00:06:27.110 a
00:06:27.470 cup
00:06:27.920 and
00:06:28.100 a
00:06:28.190 half
00:06:28.220 and

00:06:29.560 why
00:06:30.560 are
00:06:30.620 we
00:06:30.800 using
00:06:30.980 hot
00:06:31.340 water
00:06:31.510 so
00:06:32.510 that
00:06:32.540 the

00:06:33.340 vegetables
00:06:34.340 don't
00:06:35.210 get
00:06:35.420 hard
00:06:35.690 so
00:06:36.500 how
00:06:36.740 long

00:06:36.950 does
00:06:37.130 this
00:06:37.280 have
00:06:37.490 to
00:06:37.520 cook
00:06:37.880 well
00:06:38.690 the
00:06:38.810 soup

00:06:39.050 probably
00:06:39.950 a
00:06:40.370 half
00:06:40.790 hour
00:06:40.970 depending
00:06:41.390 which

00:06:41.690 kind
00:06:41.990 of
00:06:42.080 beans
00:06:42.230 you
00:06:42.320 use
00:06:42.560 if
00:06:42.830 you
00:06:42.950 use
00:06:42.980 the
00:06:43.460 dry

00:06:44.150 beans
00:06:44.420 that
00:06:44.960 you
00:06:45.020 soaked
00:06:45.380 overnight
00:06:45.680 it
00:06:46.100 takes

00:06:46.490 longer
00:06:46.760 but
00:06:47.120 it
00:06:47.210 one
00:06:47.420 ger
00:06:47.600 yeah
00:06:48.200 you'll

00:06:49.010 probably
00:06:49.310 need
00:06:49.580 about
00:06:49.670 an
00:06:49.850 hour
00:06:50.470 but
00:06:51.470 if
00:06:51.830 you

00:06:51.980 use
00:06:52.130 already
00:06:52.790 cooked
00:06:53.360 beans
00:06:54.130 20
00:06:55.130 minutes
00:06:55.430 to
00:06:55.550 a

00:06:55.610 half
00:06:55.790 hour
00:06:56.000 is
00:06:56.360 very
00:06:56.390 good
00:06:56.960 okay
00:06:57.950 so
00:06:58.400 this
00:06:58.730 has

00:06:58.940 been
00:06:59.060 cooking
00:06:59.300 for
00:06:59.480 about
00:06:59.720 20
00:07:00.290 minutes
00:07:00.650 and
00:07:00.940 we

00:07:01.940 are
00:07:02.120 ready
00:07:02.480 to
00:07:02.960 add
00:07:03.230 our
00:07:03.470 pasta
00:07:03.740 to
00:07:04.160 it
00:07:04.340 that

00:07:04.520 we've
00:07:04.640 only
00:07:04.850 cooked
00:07:05.210 halfway
00:07:05.990 because

00:07:06.230 they're
00:07:06.500 going
00:07:06.590 to
00:07:06.680 finish
00:07:07.040 cooking
00:07:07.280 inside

00:07:08.150 our
00:07:08.420 kundalini
00:07:08.900 soup
00:07:09.730 okay
00:07:13.150 drain
00:07:14.150 the
00:07:14.270 water

00:07:14.510 and
00:07:14.810 if
00:07:15.350 it's
00:07:15.530 not
00:07:15.740 drained
00:07:16.040 all
00:07:16.220 the
00:07:16.340 way
00:07:16.460 it

00:07:16.640 doesn't
00:07:16.820 really
00:07:16.970 matter
00:07:17.330 and
00:07:18.320 we're
00:07:19.310 all
00:07:19.400 set

00:07:19.610 to
00:07:19.760 go

00:07:30.270 yeah
00:07:31.270 we'll
