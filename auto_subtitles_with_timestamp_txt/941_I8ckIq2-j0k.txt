00:00:28.869 russet
00:00:29.140 potatoes
00:00:29.530 here
00:00:29.740 that
00:00:29.950 I
00:00:29.980 cut

00:00:30.250 up
00:00:30.279 about
00:00:30.640 this
00:00:30.850 size
00:00:31.119 I
00:00:31.390 like
00:00:31.570 them
00:00:31.720 about
00:00:31.990 as

00:00:32.320 thick
00:00:32.710 as
00:00:32.920 my
00:00:33.160 finger
00:00:33.610 and
00:00:33.880 about
00:00:34.180 twice
00:00:34.480 as

00:00:34.690 wide
00:00:34.900 but
00:00:35.230 it's
00:00:35.380 a
00:00:35.500 little
00:00:35.739 bit
00:00:35.860 you
00:00:36.100 know
00:00:36.220 it's

00:00:36.430 up
00:00:36.910 to
00:00:37.030 you
00:00:37.180 some
00:00:37.510 people
00:00:37.750 like
00:00:37.900 a
00:00:37.930 bigger
00:00:38.260 like

00:00:38.530 steak
00:00:39.430 fries
00:00:39.670 but
00:00:40.059 I
00:00:40.270 think
00:00:40.750 that's
00:00:40.870 a
00:00:40.900 little

00:00:40.989 too
00:00:41.200 much
00:00:41.410 so
00:00:41.830 they've
00:00:42.520 been
00:00:42.640 soaking
00:00:42.910 in
00:00:43.150 cold

00:00:43.480 water
00:00:43.629 for
00:00:43.690 about
00:00:43.840 30
00:00:43.930 minutes
00:00:44.559 and
00:00:44.710 now
00:00:44.800 I'm

00:00:44.830 just
00:00:44.890 going

00:00:45.370 them
00:00:45.489 off
00:00:45.550 on
00:00:45.699 a
00:00:45.760 clean

00:00:45.940 towel
00:00:46.210 the
00:00:46.870 soak
00:00:47.080 in
00:00:47.260 the
00:00:47.350 water
00:00:47.530 helps
00:00:47.800 make

00:00:47.980 them
00:00:48.070 really
00:00:48.250 crispy
00:00:48.610 because
00:00:48.820 it
00:00:48.940 draws
00:00:49.090 out

00:00:49.300 some
00:00:49.540 of
00:00:49.690 the
00:00:49.780 excess
00:00:50.140 starch
00:00:50.440 on
00:00:50.769 the
00:00:50.830 surface

00:00:51.519 okay

00:00:54.640 of
00:00:54.670 the

00:00:54.760 same
00:00:54.879 trick
00:00:55.180 that
00:00:55.210 you
00:00:55.420 use
00:00:55.690 like

00:00:59.440 in

00:00:59.649 towel
00:00:59.860 and

00:01:00.070 give
00:01:00.520 it
00:01:00.670 a
00:01:00.730 little
00:01:01.170 squish

00:01:06.009 we
00:01:06.160 can
00:01:06.310 kind

00:01:06.490 of
00:01:06.550 just
00:01:06.610 set
00:01:07.030 those
00:01:07.180 aside

00:01:12.310 I've
00:01:13.240 got

00:01:13.390 some
00:01:13.539 flour
00:01:13.780 and
00:01:14.200 some
00:01:14.770 baking
00:01:15.130 powder
00:01:15.280 salt

00:01:15.550 and
00:01:15.700 pepper
00:01:15.850 I'm
00:01:16.090 going
00:01:16.240 to
00:01:16.300 add
00:01:16.390 a
00:01:16.420 little
00:01:16.720 bit

00:01:16.810 of
00:01:16.930 cayenne
00:01:17.500 pepper
00:01:17.530 totally
00:01:18.490 optional
00:01:18.640 and
00:01:19.119 a

00:01:19.509 little
00:01:19.750 bit
00:01:19.840 of
00:01:19.930 dill
00:01:20.140 and
00:01:20.759 honestly
00:01:21.899 you

00:01:22.899 don't
00:01:23.080 really
00:01:23.229 taste
00:01:23.470 this
00:01:23.710 it
00:01:23.890 just
00:01:24.039 looks

00:01:24.220 really
00:01:24.280 pretty
00:01:24.640 in
00:01:24.850 the
00:01:24.880 final
00:01:25.330 product
00:01:25.690 but

00:01:25.930 you
00:01:26.050 could
00:01:26.170 totally
00:01:26.289 skip
00:01:26.590 it
00:01:26.770 or
00:01:27.369 if
00:01:27.430 you

00:01:27.520 wanted
00:01:27.700 to
00:01:27.789 add
00:01:27.850 any
00:01:28.119 other
00:01:28.240 spices
00:01:28.570 of
00:01:28.990 your

00:01:29.440 choosing
00:01:30.250 that's
00:01:30.670 fine
00:01:30.970 maybe
00:01:31.750 some
00:01:31.900 curry

00:01:32.140 powder
00:01:32.229 it
00:01:32.590 would
00:01:32.680 even
00:01:32.920 be
00:01:32.950 a
00:01:33.250 fun
00:01:33.939 little

00:01:34.350 variation
00:01:35.369 then
00:01:36.369 I've
00:01:36.460 just
00:01:36.520 got
00:01:36.729 some
00:01:37.000 plain

00:01:37.210 old
00:01:37.240 soda
00:01:37.810 water
00:01:38.080 you
00:01:38.560 could
00:01:38.710 use
00:01:38.830 beer
00:01:39.250 um
00:01:39.810 but

00:01:40.810 I'm
00:01:41.710 using
00:01:41.920 soda
00:01:42.250 water
00:01:42.490 and
00:01:42.670 this
00:01:43.119 is
00:01:43.420 sort
00:01:43.960 of

00:01:44.020 like
00:01:44.110 a
00:01:44.580 tempura
00:01:45.580 batter
00:01:45.729 and
00:01:46.270 it's
00:01:47.020 just

00:01:47.259 basically
00:01:47.740 water
00:01:47.920 and
00:01:48.159 flour
00:01:48.400 and
00:01:48.729 then
00:01:48.880 we're

00:01:48.970 going
00:01:49.090 to
00:01:49.119 add
00:01:49.240 in
00:01:49.390 a
00:01:49.450 couple
00:01:49.479 of
00:01:49.780 ice
00:01:49.900 cubes

00:01:50.040 some
00:01:51.040 recipes
00:01:51.430 you'll
00:01:51.580 see
00:01:51.759 add
00:01:52.000 egg
00:01:52.299 to
00:01:52.479 the

00:01:52.570 better
00:01:52.750 but
00:01:52.960 I
00:01:53.020 think
00:01:53.259 that
00:01:53.439 that
00:01:53.470 makes
00:01:53.740 it
00:01:53.920 a

00:01:54.009 little
00:01:54.130 bit
00:01:54.400 chewy
00:01:55.210 I
00:01:55.570 like
00:01:56.200 this
00:01:56.409 because

00:01:56.710 it's
00:01:57.070 definitely
00:01:57.729 very
00:01:58.150 light
00:01:58.540 and
00:01:58.720 crisp
00:01:59.020 and

00:01:59.229 that's
00:01:59.350 what
00:01:59.560 I
00:01:59.590 like
00:01:59.860 and
00:02:00.130 my
00:02:01.119 fish
00:02:01.329 and
00:02:01.509 chips

00:02:01.689 but
00:02:02.500 I
00:02:02.710 guess
00:02:02.890 it's
00:02:03.070 a
00:02:03.100 personal
00:02:03.460 preference

00:02:03.640 that
00:02:04.450 looks
00:02:04.659 about
00:02:04.810 right
00:02:05.380 and
00:02:06.100 I'm
00:02:06.640 just

00:02:06.759 going
00:02:06.880 to
00:02:06.970 add
00:02:07.090 in
00:02:07.329 a
00:02:07.450 couple
00:02:07.659 ice
00:02:07.869 cubes

00:02:08.200 that's
00:02:08.769 going
00:02:08.950 to
00:02:09.009 help
00:02:09.130 keep
00:02:09.310 it
00:02:09.429 cool
00:02:09.640 and
00:02:09.910 we

00:02:10.390 can
00:02:10.540 set
00:02:10.750 this
00:02:10.869 aside
00:02:11.130 while
00:02:12.130 our
00:02:12.430 oil
00:02:12.670 heats

00:02:12.910 up
00:02:13.060 waiting
00:02:13.329 for
00:02:13.480 our
00:02:13.540 oil
00:02:13.720 to
00:02:13.780 heat
00:02:13.989 up
00:02:14.019 to
00:02:14.940 330

00:02:15.940 so
00:02:16.450 I'll
00:02:16.720 let
00:02:17.049 you
00:02:17.260 guys
00:02:17.500 know
00:02:17.530 when
00:02:18.070 that

00:02:18.310 happens
00:02:18.730 okay
00:02:19.060 so
00:02:19.120 you
00:02:19.329 just
00:02:19.420 sit
00:02:20.079 tight
00:02:20.430 so

00:02:21.430 our
00:02:21.579 oil
00:02:21.610 is
00:02:22.090 hot
00:02:22.450 at
00:02:22.690 about
00:02:22.930 3:30
00:02:23.500 and
00:02:23.799 our

00:02:24.010 potatoes
00:02:24.430 are
00:02:24.519 dry
00:02:24.959 so
00:02:25.959 we
00:02:26.110 can
00:02:26.230 go
00:02:26.350 ahead
00:02:26.470 and

00:02:26.709 do
00:02:26.829 the
00:02:26.950 first
00:02:27.250 frying
00:02:27.910 and
00:02:28.209 this
00:02:28.299 first
00:02:28.600 time

00:02:28.900 we're
00:02:29.680 just
00:02:29.860 trying
00:02:30.100 to
00:02:30.160 cook
00:02:30.310 the
00:02:30.489 potatoes

00:02:30.610 we're
00:02:30.970 not
00:02:31.090 really
00:02:31.269 trying
00:02:31.480 to
00:02:31.570 brown
00:02:31.720 them
00:02:31.900 so

00:02:32.110 we're
00:02:32.260 just
00:02:32.380 going
00:02:32.500 to
00:02:32.530 put
00:02:32.769 in
00:02:32.860 the
00:02:32.980 potatoes

00:02:33.459 and
00:02:34.050 let
00:02:35.050 them
00:02:35.140 cook
00:02:35.349 for
00:02:35.410 about
00:02:35.830 two
00:02:36.370 minutes

00:02:36.550 or
00:02:37.030 until
00:02:37.540 like
00:02:38.020 the
00:02:38.200 all
00:02:38.560 the

00:02:40.060 a
00:02:40.180 little
00:02:40.390 bit
00:02:40.510 and
00:02:41.350 don't
00:02:41.440 overload

00:02:41.830 it
00:02:41.890 too
00:02:42.130 much
00:02:42.310 just
00:02:42.640 because
00:02:42.730 you
00:02:42.880 don't
00:02:43.000 want

00:02:43.120 to
00:02:43.180 drop
00:02:43.270 the
00:02:43.420 temperature
00:02:43.540 so
00:02:43.990 maybe
00:02:44.340 handful

00:02:45.340 Oh
00:02:45.400 potatoes
00:02:45.760 at
00:02:45.850 a
00:02:45.910 time
00:02:46.120 not
00:02:47.110 that
00:02:47.170 you
00:02:47.440 could

00:02:47.590 use
00:02:47.740 your
00:02:47.890 hands
00:02:48.100 to
00:02:48.430 put

00:02:52.420 minutes
00:02:52.510 later
00:02:52.840 you

00:02:53.230 see

00:02:53.380 our

00:02:55.780 as

00:02:56.020 furiously
00:02:56.950 boiling
00:02:57.310 as
00:02:57.610 it
00:02:57.730 was

00:02:58.960 dropped
00:02:59.290 them
00:02:59.410 in
00:02:59.640 and
00:03:00.640 the
