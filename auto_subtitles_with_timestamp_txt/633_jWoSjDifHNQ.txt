00:00:05.250 how
00:00:05.490 to
00:00:05.520 make
00:00:05.790 chicken

00:00:06.180 google
00:00:06.509 geek
00:00:06.690 I
00:00:06.930 thought
00:00:07.259 I
00:00:07.529 would
00:00:07.799 try
00:00:08.010 to

00:00:08.099 show
00:00:08.250 you
00:00:08.460 my
00:00:09.360 mom's
00:00:09.690 way
00:00:09.990 to
00:00:10.050 do
00:00:10.349 it
00:00:10.530 which

00:00:10.830 means

00:00:15.599 out
00:00:15.960 the
00:00:16.560 measurements

00:00:17.520 that
00:00:17.699 she's
00:00:17.940 because
00:00:18.390 she
00:00:18.539 doesn't
00:00:18.869 use
00:00:19.080 exact

00:00:19.470 measurements
00:00:20.189 another
00:00:20.550 reason
00:00:20.880 why
00:00:21.029 I
00:00:21.090 like

00:00:21.510 chicken
00:00:21.810 blue

00:00:22.800 the
00:00:22.920 beef
00:00:23.189 one
00:00:23.519 so

00:00:23.820 much
00:00:24.090 the
00:00:24.359 beef
00:00:24.570 one
00:00:24.840 has
00:00:25.439 like
00:00:25.920 the
00:00:26.189 typical

00:00:26.609 soy
00:00:27.510 sauce
00:00:27.869 garlic
00:00:28.380 ginger
00:00:29.010 and
00:00:29.369 a
00:00:30.090 little
00:00:30.119 bit

00:00:30.480 of
00:00:30.599 sugar
00:00:30.750 or
00:00:31.050 honey
00:00:31.230 for
00:00:31.560 sweetness
00:00:31.710 but
00:00:32.700 the

00:00:33.270 one
00:00:33.390 that
00:00:33.510 used
00:00:33.780 for
00:00:34.020 chicken
00:00:34.440 it
00:00:34.710 has
00:00:35.040 a
00:00:35.070 hot

00:00:35.610 pepper
00:00:36.090 paste
00:00:37.489 this
00:00:38.489 hot
00:00:39.120 pepper
00:00:39.329 paste

00:00:39.510 already
00:00:40.140 took
00:00:40.860 some
00:00:41.040 out

00:00:42.090 it's
00:00:42.660 very
00:00:42.840 red
00:00:43.110 it's
00:00:43.379 very
00:00:43.559 spicy
00:00:43.940 and
00:00:44.940 it's

00:00:45.360 pasty
00:00:45.989 so
00:00:46.260 um
00:00:47.120 when
00:00:48.120 my
00:00:48.239 mom
00:00:48.450 used
00:00:48.719 it
00:00:48.899 with

00:00:49.140 chicken
00:00:49.649 I
00:00:49.829 remember
00:00:50.280 liking
00:00:50.700 it
00:00:50.969 better

00:00:51.120 cause
00:00:51.390 I'm
00:00:51.539 spicier
00:00:52.020 and
00:00:52.079 she
00:00:52.260 just
00:00:52.410 made
00:00:52.649 it

00:00:52.680 less
00:00:52.949 often
00:00:53.190 so
00:00:53.670 it
00:00:53.789 felt
00:00:54.030 like
00:00:54.090 it
00:00:54.329 was
00:00:54.449 more

00:00:54.539 special
00:00:54.809 when
00:00:55.110 she
00:00:55.289 made
00:00:55.440 it
00:00:55.620 so
00:00:55.860 first
00:00:56.160 your

00:00:56.430 choice
00:00:57.420 of

00:01:55.009 garlic
00:01:55.310 instead
00:01:56.030 I

00:01:59.899 sauce
00:02:00.020 and
00:02:01.060 I
00:02:02.060 guess

00:02:02.689 tbsp
00:02:03.470 of
00:02:03.799 sesame
00:02:04.549 oil

00:02:05.780 almost
00:02:06.110 run

00:02:06.409 out

00:02:10.580 teaspoon

00:02:13.700 stalks
00:02:14.030 of
00:02:14.299 green

00:02:15.049 onions
00:02:15.620 that
00:02:15.860 we're
00:02:16.010 gonna
00:02:16.099 chop
00:02:16.549 in
00:02:16.790 and
00:02:17.060 the

00:02:17.390 end
00:02:17.540 and
00:02:17.989 before
00:02:18.739 we
00:02:19.040 get
00:02:19.190 started
00:02:19.540 I'll
00:02:20.540 show

00:02:20.780 you
00:02:20.870 how
00:02:21.019 to
00:02:21.049 chop
00:02:21.410 up
00:02:22.060 ginger
00:02:23.090 it
00:02:23.330 looks

00:02:23.480 really
00:02:23.630 hairy
00:02:24.049 and
00:02:24.380 weird
00:02:24.650 once
00:02:24.890 you
00:02:25.130 chop
00:02:25.610 off

00:02:25.849 all
00:02:26.030 the
00:02:26.180 outside
00:02:26.660 woody
00:02:27.560 part
00:02:27.860 and
00:02:28.280 it
00:02:28.819 looks

00:02:29.000 like
00:02:29.060 this
00:02:29.269 and
00:02:29.450 it
00:02:29.540 looks
00:02:29.720 like
00:02:29.840 it's
00:02:30.290 hard
00:02:30.830 to

00:02:30.920 chop
00:02:31.340 but
00:02:31.700 almost
00:02:32.150 really
00:02:32.480 not
00:02:32.660 so
00:02:33.230 you
00:02:33.290 do
00:02:33.680 it

00:02:33.829 against
00:02:34.430 the
00:02:34.579 grain
00:02:34.910 like
00:02:35.569 this
00:02:35.900 and
00:02:36.349 it's
00:02:36.829 all

00:02:37.010 hairy
00:02:37.370 and
00:02:37.489 then
00:02:37.819 you
00:02:37.940 get
00:02:38.060 the
00:02:38.239 bottom
00:02:38.810 end
00:02:39.019 of

00:02:39.170 a
00:02:39.230 nice
00:02:43.299 cool
00:02:44.299 little
00:02:44.510 finer
00:02:44.930 if
00:02:45.230 you'd
00:02:45.410 like

00:02:45.650 but
00:02:45.920 I
00:02:46.130 just
00:02:46.430 don't

00:02:47.970 like
00:02:48.720 doing
00:02:49.050 that
00:02:49.200 also
00:02:49.410 you
00:02:49.620 could
00:02:49.770 use
00:02:50.010 a

00:02:50.160 food
00:02:50.550 processor
00:02:50.690 but
00:02:52.610 after
00:02:53.610 you
00:02:53.700 do
00:02:53.820 that

00:02:53.850 just
00:02:54.030 weather
00:02:54.780 and
00:02:55.110 the
00:02:55.170 same
00:02:55.380 thing
00:02:55.560 with

00:02:55.740 some
00:02:56.120 garlic

00:02:57.830 you
00:02:58.830 should
00:02:59.100 squish
00:02:59.430 it
00:02:59.640 like
00:02:59.850 that
00:03:00.590 to

00:03:01.590 release
00:03:01.860 all
00:03:02.040 the
00:03:02.160 juices
00:03:02.400 and
00:03:02.970 then
00:03:03.620 stop

00:03:04.620 finer
00:03:05.130 if
00:03:05.520 you
00:03:05.670 like
00:03:05.910 but
00:03:06.210 you
00:03:06.510 don't
00:03:06.690 have
00:03:06.930 to

00:03:07.140 if
00:03:07.200 you
00:03:07.380 like
00:03:07.830 it
00:03:08.010 chunky
00:03:08.250 a
00:03:08.460 little
00:03:08.880 bit
00:03:09.650 okay

00:03:10.650 let's
00:03:11.550 get
00:03:11.880 started
00:03:12.450 on
00:03:12.630 the
00:03:12.750 assembly
00:03:13.320 all

00:03:14.250 right
00:03:14.460 this
00:03:15.060 is
00:03:15.240 a
00:03:15.270 very
00:03:15.600 TV
00:03:15.930 pretty
00:03:16.560 because
00:03:16.800 I

00:03:19.760 don't
00:03:20.760 want
00:03:21.000 to
00:03:21.060 do
00:03:21.210 as
00:03:21.330 many
00:03:21.480 dishes
00:03:21.810 as
00:03:22.320 we're

00:03:23.070 done
00:03:23.280 okay

00:03:24.740 so
00:03:25.740 first
00:03:26.070 take
00:03:26.430 place
00:03:27.270 only
00:03:27.800 okay
00:03:28.800 five
00:03:30.470 do

00:03:31.470 that
00:03:31.680 okay
00:03:32.040 so
00:03:32.730 first
00:03:33.030 take
00:03:33.450 your
00:03:34.430 PC

00:03:35.990 ingredients
00:03:36.990 and
00:03:37.200 then
00:03:37.590 put
00:03:38.250 it
00:03:38.340 in
00:03:38.460 your
00:03:38.610 bowl

00:03:38.910 and
00:03:40.400 if
00:03:41.400 you
00:03:41.550 don't
00:03:41.760 have
00:03:41.970 money
00:03:42.210 but
00:03:42.540 you
00:03:42.660 have

00:03:42.840 like
00:03:43.050 brown
00:03:43.320 sugar
00:03:43.350 or
00:03:43.770 white
00:03:44.010 sugar
00:03:44.070 you

00:03:44.820 should
00:03:45.030 use
00:03:45.180 a
00:03:45.210 little
00:03:45.450 less
00:03:45.780 than
00:03:46.260 shown
00:03:46.620 here

00:03:46.890 but
00:03:47.070 it
00:03:47.190 should
00:03:47.400 still
00:03:47.550 be
00:03:47.730 fine
00:03:49.610 and
00:03:50.610 then

00:03:59.709 it
00:04:00.709 makes
00:04:00.950 it
00:04:01.160 a
00:04:01.250 little
00:04:01.430 bit
00:04:01.760 for
00:04:02.000 my
00:04:02.360 spoon

00:04:02.930 Department
00:04:03.800 1
00:04:04.610 tablespoon
00:04:05.239 up
00:04:05.390 any
00:04:05.870 oil

00:04:15.729 ginger
00:04:16.930 a
00:04:20.199 ton
00:04:21.199 of
00:04:21.229 garlic
00:04:36.370 and
00:04:37.370 then

00:04:40.610 and
00:04:41.610 we're
00:04:41.970 on
00:04:42.210 the
00:04:42.840 green
00:04:43.050 onions
00:04:43.439 instead
00:04:44.099 of

00:04:44.220 chopping
00:04:44.610 them
00:04:44.759 up
00:04:44.849 I
00:04:45.060 just
00:04:45.270 like
00:04:46.280 using
00:04:47.280 my

00:04:47.610 shears
00:04:48.090 kitchen
00:04:48.659 shears
00:04:48.960 because
00:04:49.289 it
00:04:49.560 makes

00:04:49.740 it
00:04:49.889 a
00:04:50.009 lot
00:04:50.129 easier
00:04:50.340 and
00:04:50.939 I
00:04:51.060 also
00:04:51.150 like
00:04:51.449 using

00:04:51.629 green
00:04:52.110 onions
00:04:52.500 instead
00:04:52.860 of
00:04:52.979 onions
00:04:53.430 so

00:04:53.639 there's
00:04:53.819 less
00:04:53.969 liquid
00:04:54.479 when
00:04:54.719 we're
00:04:54.900 cooking

00:04:55.080 on
00:04:55.349 the
00:04:55.469 show
00:04:55.740 where
00:04:56.039 if
00:04:56.159 you're
00:04:56.340 grilling
00:04:56.580 I

00:04:56.879 guess
00:04:57.150 if
00:04:57.930 you
00:04:58.139 are
00:04:58.229 using
00:04:58.469 a
00:04:58.710 grill

00:05:06.730 I
00:05:07.170 think
00:05:08.170 for
00:05:08.470 green
00:05:08.770 on
00:05:08.920 your
00:05:08.950 left
00:05:09.310 college
00:05:09.730 I

00:05:11.520 like
00:05:12.520 to
00:05:12.940 clean

00:05:19.280 I
00:05:19.370 want
00:05:20.030 to
00:05:20.120 get
00:05:20.240 to
00:05:20.389 the
00:05:20.480 wider
00:05:20.720 part
00:05:21.050 I
00:05:21.230 like

00:05:21.410 to
00:05:21.590 cut
00:05:21.830 it
00:05:21.950 in
00:05:22.070 half
00:05:22.340 and
00:05:22.700 start
00:05:23.150 cutting

00:05:23.330 because
00:05:24.260 that
00:05:24.380 parts
00:05:24.680 a
00:05:24.740 bit
00:05:24.950 stronger
00:05:29.200 okay

00:05:30.200 and
00:05:30.440 it's
00:05:30.560 just
00:05:30.740 well
00:05:30.919 really
00:05:31.130 spicy

00:05:49.320 just
00:05:49.710 put
00:05:50.070 it
00:05:50.190 in
00:05:50.280 easier
00:05:50.900 now
00:05:51.900 that
00:05:51.930 the

00:05:52.350 marinade
00:05:52.920 is
00:05:53.100 done
00:05:53.540 I'm
00:05:54.540 going
00:05:54.630 to
00:05:54.840 take
00:05:55.110 our

00:05:55.440 chicken
00:05:55.890 pieces
00:05:57.290 and
00:05:58.290 then
00:05:58.440 start
00:05:58.710 going
00:05:58.980 to

00:05:59.130 remove
00:05:59.490 the
00:05:59.700 fat
00:05:59.970 off
00:06:00.180 and
00:06:00.420 then
00:06:00.600 chopping

00:06:00.930 against
00:06:01.500 the
00:06:01.590 green
00:06:01.830 as
00:06:02.040 well
00:06:03.110 for
00:06:04.110 the
00:06:04.230 fat

00:06:04.500 just
00:06:04.920 kind
00:06:05.130 of
00:06:05.160 put
00:06:05.430 it

00:06:11.910 and
00:06:12.420 I
00:06:12.510 know
00:06:12.570 either
00:06:13.380 fattier
00:06:14.280 cut
00:06:15.240 of
00:06:15.360 meat

00:06:15.800 but
00:06:16.800 I
00:06:17.040 like
00:06:17.220 the
00:06:17.340 way
00:06:17.460 it
00:06:17.520 tastes
00:06:17.790 better
00:06:18.060 with

00:06:18.300 this
00:06:18.480 marinade
00:06:19.020 but
00:06:19.770 again
00:06:20.040 we've
00:06:20.220 done
00:06:20.430 it

00:06:20.550 with
00:06:20.700 chicken
00:06:21.060 too
00:06:21.570 so
00:06:21.930 that's
00:06:22.260 not
00:06:22.500 a
00:06:22.830 huge

00:06:32.719 and
00:06:33.229 then
00:06:33.379 so
00:06:34.039 you
00:06:34.069 see
00:06:34.339 the
00:06:34.489 grain
00:06:34.789 happening

00:06:35.419 going
00:06:35.749 this
00:06:35.959 way
00:06:36.229 right
00:06:36.589 so
00:06:37.489 you
00:06:38.389 should
00:06:38.419 cut

00:06:38.839 about
00:06:41.019 how
00:06:42.019 big
00:06:42.229 would
00:06:42.349 you
00:06:42.409 say
00:06:42.619 this
00:06:42.769 is
00:06:42.829 half

00:06:43.129 an
00:06:43.309 inch
00:06:43.519 thick
00:06:43.579 long
00:06:44.479 strip
00:06:46.389 chicken
00:06:47.389 by

00:06:50.700 okay
00:06:51.480 so
00:06:51.540 I
00:06:51.750 just
00:06:51.960 got
00:06:52.200 done
00:06:52.580 trimming
00:06:53.580 the
00:06:53.760 fat

00:06:53.970 off
00:06:54.240 of
00:06:54.270 the
00:06:54.660 42
00:06:55.350 the
00:06:55.650 five
00:06:55.890 and
00:06:56.280 sure
00:06:56.550 they
00:06:56.760 are

00:06:56.970 and
00:06:57.960 then
00:06:58.760 we're
00:06:59.760 almost
00:07:00.030 done
00:07:00.630 now
00:07:01.730 they're

00:07:02.730 just
00:07:02.880 going
00:07:03.060 to
00:07:03.150 sit
00:07:03.420 like
00:07:03.600 this
00:07:03.630 in
00:07:04.020 the

00:07:04.110 fridge
00:07:04.380 for
00:07:04.680 an
00:07:04.920 hour
00:07:04.980 I
00:07:05.490 mean
00:07:05.790 earlier
00:07:06.300 this

00:07:06.510 week
00:07:06.750 when
00:07:06.930 we
00:07:07.140 made
00:07:07.320 this
00:07:07.560 we
00:07:07.890 just
00:07:08.930 rotated

00:07:09.930 immediately
00:07:10.740 and
00:07:11.070 it
00:07:11.790 tastes
00:07:12.090 it
00:07:12.180 perfectly

00:07:12.720 fine
00:07:13.440 and
00:07:13.800 it
00:07:13.890 was
00:07:14.100 really
00:07:14.400 good
00:07:14.640 with
00:07:14.850 lettuce

00:07:15.210 wrap
00:07:15.480 and
00:07:15.510 we're
00:07:15.840 going
00:07:15.960 to
00:07:15.990 do
00:07:16.170 that
00:07:16.320 again

00:07:16.710 but
00:07:18.890 today
00:07:19.890 since
00:07:20.720 I'm
00:07:21.720 worried
00:07:22.350 I
00:07:22.620 mean
00:07:22.800 it's

00:07:22.920 not
00:07:23.010 dinnertime
00:07:23.370 yet
00:07:23.610 that's
00:07:24.000 why
00:07:24.240 I'm

00:07:24.450 feeling
00:07:24.810 much
00:07:24.930 earlier
00:07:25.350 so
00:07:25.500 I'm
00:07:25.590 going
00:07:25.770 to
00:07:25.830 let

00:07:25.950 it
00:07:25.980 marinate
00:07:26.490 and
00:07:26.700 it
00:07:26.820 always
00:07:26.940 does

00:07:27.450 piece
00:07:27.600 a
00:07:27.630 little
00:07:28.020 better
00:07:28.230 when
00:07:28.410 it's

00:07:28.560 marinating
00:07:30.050 anyway
00:07:31.050 so
00:07:31.650 we're
00:07:31.830 going
00:07:31.980 to
00:07:32.070 let

00:07:32.550 this
00:07:32.670 marinate
00:07:32.880 until
00:07:33.450 it's
00:07:33.540 the
00:07:33.600 right
00:07:33.780 time

00:07:33.990 and
00:07:34.170 then
00:07:34.290 I'll
00:07:34.440 show
00:07:34.650 you
00:07:34.710 how
00:07:35.010 you
00:07:35.070 can
00:07:35.280 fold

00:07:35.670 up
00:07:35.910 a
00:07:36.150 lot
00:07:36.480 of
00:07:36.630 straps
00:07:36.930 you
00:07:37.230 can
00:07:37.410 enjoy
00:07:37.680 this

00:07:37.920 with
00:07:38.480 whether
00:07:39.480 it's
00:07:39.720 romaine
00:07:40.050 lettuce
00:07:40.230 or

00:07:40.710 green
00:07:41.520 leaf
00:07:41.730 or
00:07:42.000 red
00:07:42.360 leaf
00:07:42.600 or
00:07:42.870 butter
00:07:43.190 flooded

00:07:44.190 with
00:07:44.940 white
00:07:45.420 rice
00:07:45.690 either
00:07:46.110 sticky
00:07:46.710 rice
00:07:46.920 or

00:07:47.220 long
00:07:47.490 grain
00:07:47.820 or
00:07:48.150 brown
00:07:48.720 rice
00:07:48.750 we've
00:07:49.230 done
00:07:49.500 it

00:07:49.650 all
00:07:49.800 and
00:07:50.070 it
00:07:50.160 all
00:07:50.280 tastes
00:07:50.610 really
00:07:50.760 good
00:07:51.030 so
00:07:51.540 on

00:08:02.060 the
00:08:03.060 stovetop

00:08:08.590 I
00:08:08.650 have
00:08:08.830 a
00:08:08.860 medium
00:08:09.520 heat
00:08:09.759 right
00:08:10.000 now
00:08:10.270 with

00:08:10.810 about
00:08:11.229 a
00:08:11.650 little
00:08:12.099 less
00:08:12.250 than
00:08:12.430 a
00:08:12.490 tablespoon
00:08:13.180 of

00:08:13.300 oil
00:08:13.509 we're
00:08:14.440 using
00:08:14.680 a
00:08:15.069 really
00:08:15.490 small
00:08:15.759 skillet

00:08:16.150 use
00:08:16.509 the
00:08:16.659 bigger
00:08:16.930 one
00:08:17.229 if
00:08:17.409 you
00:08:17.560 have
00:08:17.800 it
00:08:18.009 we

00:08:18.280 have
00:08:18.310 a
00:08:18.460 bigger
00:08:18.789 one
00:08:19.229 but
00:08:21.599 the
00:08:22.599 nonstick
00:08:23.139 has

00:08:23.409 like
00:08:23.620 scraped
00:08:24.009 off
00:08:24.190 this
00:08:24.400 time
00:08:24.729 and
00:08:25.120 it's

00:08:25.270 pretty
00:08:25.900 terrible
00:08:26.319 still
00:08:26.919 I
00:08:27.280 don't
00:08:27.490 want
00:08:27.729 to

00:08:27.819 use
00:08:28.470 our
00:08:29.470 old
00:08:29.919 frying
00:08:30.819 pan
00:08:31.589 try
00:08:32.589 to
00:08:32.649 drift
00:08:32.950 off

00:08:34.149 stir
00:08:35.110 it
00:08:35.909 and
00:08:36.909 I
00:08:37.360 think
00:08:38.020 we're
00:08:38.140 going
00:08:38.289 to
00:08:38.349 cook

00:08:38.560 about
00:08:38.740 half
00:08:39.250 at

00:08:39.520 time
00:08:39.719 make
00:08:40.719 your
00:08:40.750 it

00:08:54.580 do
00:08:55.000 that
00:08:55.240 but
00:08:55.600 I
00:08:55.840 thought
00:08:56.080 I
00:08:56.440 would
00:08:56.590 try
00:08:57.010 to

00:08:57.430 keep
00:08:58.090 things
00:08:58.650 clean

00:09:00.340 dog
00:09:00.580 is
00:09:00.790 watching
00:09:01.240 us

00:09:01.920 she's

00:09:15.670 of
00:09:15.820 the
00:09:15.880 wrap
00:09:16.180 I
00:09:16.360 guess
