00:02:33.790 right
00:02:33.940 there
00:02:34.590 now
00:02:35.590 if
00:02:35.770 your

00:02:35.950 noodles
00:02:36.310 are
00:02:36.460 a
00:02:36.490 little
00:02:36.520 bit
00:02:36.760 harder
00:02:37.030 than
00:02:37.060 you

00:02:37.360 wanted
00:02:37.660 them
00:02:37.810 to
00:02:37.840 be

00:02:44.590 not
00:02:44.800 too
00:02:45.220 mushy

00:02:46.420 you

00:02:48.340 heat

00:02:49.090 it
00:02:49.150 looks
00:02:49.900 like
00:02:50.020 my
00:02:50.170 noodles
00:02:50.470 are

00:02:53.440 needs
00:02:53.470 more
00:02:53.709 sauce
00:02:54.130 and

00:02:54.600 it
