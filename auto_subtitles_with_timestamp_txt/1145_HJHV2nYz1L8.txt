00:00:55.770 seafood
00:00:56.460 for

00:01:00.449 or
00:01:00.660 we

00:01:01.170 omit

00:01:01.379 the
00:01:01.680 meat
00:01:01.859 altogether
00:01:03.290 we
00:01:04.290 start
00:01:04.589 by
00:01:04.739 removing

00:01:05.070 the
00:01:05.369 fresh
00:01:05.640 egg
00:01:05.850 noodles
00:01:06.240 from
00:01:06.390 the
00:01:06.540 packaging

00:01:07.049 now
00:01:07.860 gently
00:01:08.310 unravel
00:01:08.820 and
00:01:09.210 loosen
00:01:09.720 each
00:01:09.930 of

00:01:10.110 the
00:01:10.229 bundles
00:01:12.439 using
00:01:13.439 kitchen
00:01:13.650 shears
00:01:13.860 cut
00:01:14.400 the

00:01:14.549 strands
00:01:14.880 so
00:01:15.090 they
00:01:15.210 are
00:01:15.330 shorter
00:01:15.780 this
00:01:16.229 will

00:01:16.500 make
00:01:16.650 it
00:01:16.799 easier
00:01:17.220 to
00:01:17.430 cook
00:01:17.640 and
00:01:17.880 eat
00:01:18.240 later

00:01:19.670 next
00:01:20.670 bring
00:01:21.060 a
00:01:21.150 large
00:01:21.479 pot
00:01:21.570 of
00:01:21.960 water
00:01:22.170 to
00:01:22.290 a

00:01:22.500 rapid
00:01:22.979 boil
00:01:23.420 drop
00:01:24.420 in
00:01:24.570 the
00:01:24.720 noodles
00:01:25.049 and
00:01:25.259 then

00:01:26.100 swirl
00:01:26.490 around
00:01:26.670 in
00:01:26.970 the
00:01:27.090 hot
00:01:27.270 water
00:01:27.509 for
00:01:27.840 30

00:01:28.170 seconds
00:01:28.740 as
00:01:28.890 the
00:01:29.610 noodles
00:01:29.939 are
00:01:30.060 really
00:01:30.360 thin

00:01:30.780 we
00:01:31.049 don't
00:01:31.290 want
00:01:31.500 to
00:01:31.619 overcook
00:01:31.920 them
00:01:32.340 now
00:01:33.119 we

00:01:33.180 drain
00:01:33.630 the
00:01:33.780 noodles
00:01:33.810 in
00:01:34.320 a
00:01:34.409 large
00:01:34.680 colander
00:01:37.430 we

00:01:38.430 rinse
00:01:38.670 with
00:01:38.909 cold
00:01:39.119 water
00:01:39.390 to
00:01:39.570 stop
00:01:39.990 the

00:01:40.020 cooking
00:01:40.200 process
00:01:41.450 toss
00:01:42.450 the
00:01:42.659 noodles
00:01:42.810 in
00:01:43.170 the

00:01:43.290 colander
00:01:43.680 and
00:01:43.950 try
00:01:44.280 to
00:01:44.340 remove
00:01:44.759 as
00:01:44.970 much
00:01:45.240 of

00:01:45.479 the
00:01:45.570 water
00:01:45.750 as
00:01:45.930 possible
00:01:47.060 now
00:01:48.060 let's
00:01:48.329 spread

00:01:48.630 out
00:01:48.750 the
00:01:48.960 noodles
00:01:49.320 on
00:01:49.530 several
00:01:50.009 large

00:01:50.340 platters
00:01:50.939 or
00:01:51.119 trays
00:01:51.570 and
00:01:51.840 let
00:01:52.079 them
00:01:52.259 air-dry

00:01:52.500 for
00:01:52.770 2
00:01:53.280 hours
00:01:53.729 it's
00:01:54.540 important
00:01:55.110 that
00:01:55.170 the

00:01:55.409 noodles
00:01:55.710 are
00:01:55.920 dry
00:01:56.159 before
00:01:56.549 stir
00:01:56.850 frying

00:01:57.180 otherwise
00:01:57.780 they
00:01:58.110 will
00:01:58.259 be
00:01:58.380 soft
00:01:58.710 and
00:01:58.920 mushy

00:01:59.960 for
00:02:00.960 the
00:02:01.110 roast
00:02:01.320 pork
00:02:01.590 or
00:02:01.860 any
00:02:02.040 meat
00:02:02.310 of
00:02:02.460 your

00:02:02.670 choice
00:02:02.939 we
00:02:03.240 just
00:02:03.479 need
00:02:03.659 to
00:02:03.780 cut
00:02:03.960 into
00:02:04.259 thin

00:02:04.500 strips
00:02:05.960 smash
00:02:06.960 the
00:02:07.200 garlic
00:02:07.380 and
00:02:07.740 then
00:02:07.890 remove

00:02:08.250 the
00:02:08.429 skin
00:02:08.729 now
00:02:09.629 we
00:02:09.690 can
00:02:10.020 finally
00:02:10.289 mince
00:02:10.679 it

00:02:11.750 for
00:02:12.750 the
00:02:12.870 carrots
00:02:13.230 cut
00:02:13.500 into
00:02:13.530 thin
00:02:14.099 slices
00:02:14.280 I'm

00:02:14.790 cutting
00:02:15.209 at
00:02:15.360 a
00:02:15.390 slight
00:02:15.750 angle
00:02:15.930 and
00:02:16.470 then
00:02:17.069 we

00:02:17.250 cut
00:02:17.459 into
00:02:17.670 thin

00:02:22.800 and
00:02:23.340 then

00:02:24.000 again
00:02:24.300 we
00:02:24.480 cut
00:02:24.690 each
