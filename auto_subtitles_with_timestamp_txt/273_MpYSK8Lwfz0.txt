00:03:03.030 makes
00:03:03.269 a
00:03:03.480 huge

00:03:03.510 difference
00:03:03.980 the

00:03:07.650 cracked

00:03:07.950 it
00:03:08.819 just

00:03:12.380 really
00:03:13.380 is

00:03:13.530 a
00:03:13.560 lot
00:03:13.769 tastier

00:03:15.239 of

00:03:15.329 kosher
00:03:15.540 salt
00:03:17.959 you
00:03:18.959 can
00:03:19.109 season
00:03:19.410 it
00:03:19.620 pretty

00:03:19.890 well

00:03:23.640 up
00:03:23.730 pretty

00:03:27.410 so
00:03:28.410 go
00:03:29.070 ahead

00:03:29.160 and
00:03:29.310 move
00:03:29.489 it
00:03:29.609 around
00:03:29.700 and
00:03:30.060 then
00:03:30.239 give
00:03:30.480 it
00:03:30.630 one

00:03:30.810 more
00:03:31.109 little
00:03:31.440 bit

00:03:35.820 pepper
00:03:36.269 and
00:03:37.040 that
00:03:38.040 looks
00:03:38.280 pretty

00:03:40.040 our
00:03:40.640 beef
00:03:40.849 is
00:03:41.030 well
00:03:41.299 seasoned
00:03:41.840 we'll
00:03:42.049 move

00:03:42.170 that
00:03:42.349 over
00:03:42.530 to

00:03:44.959 10
00:03:45.200 8
00:03:45.819 so
00:03:46.819 when
00:03:47.239 we're
00:03:47.390 sauteing
00:03:47.930 our
00:03:48.230 searing

00:03:49.129 we
00:03:49.370 want
00:03:49.610 to
00:03:49.670 get
00:03:49.790 the
00:03:49.879 pan
00:03:50.120 extremely
00:03:50.900 high

00:03:51.140 I'm
00:03:51.829 going
00:03:52.069 to
00:03:52.129 kick
00:03:52.310 up
00:03:52.459 my
00:03:52.640 fan
00:03:52.970 here

00:03:57.079 oil
00:03:57.290 in
00:03:58.060 and
00:03:59.060 I

00:03:59.120 think
00:03:59.209 we
00:03:59.450 can
00:03:59.629 even
00:03:59.870 like

00:04:05.269 gonna

00:04:05.360 actually
00:04:05.599 give

00:04:09.409 cook
00:04:09.620 off
00:04:09.829 this

00:04:18.440 about
00:04:18.560 four
00:04:18.949 batches

00:04:42.950 it's
00:04:43.400 been
00:04:43.610 cooking
00:04:43.940 now

00:04:44.420 two
00:04:44.780 minutes

00:04:47.780 little
00:04:47.930 bit
00:04:49.780 and
00:04:50.780 then

00:04:50.960 I'm
00:04:51.050 gonna
00:04:51.200 let
00:04:51.380 it
00:04:51.440 fit
00:04:51.860 once
00:04:52.190 again
00:04:53.560 and
00:04:54.560 this

00:04:54.710 looks
00:04:54.950 pretty
00:04:55.160 good
00:04:55.430 as
00:04:55.640 you
00:04:55.730 can
00:04:55.880 see
00:04:56.150 it's

00:04:57.950 nice
00:04:58.100 sear
00:04:58.430 on
00:04:58.640 it
00:04:58.790 right
00:04:59.000 now

00:05:03.940 so
00:05:04.940 what
00:05:05.150 I'm
00:05:05.210 going
00:05:05.300 to
00:05:05.360 do
00:05:05.510 is
00:05:05.920 half
00:05:06.920 the
00:05:07.190 beef

00:05:07.340 is
00:05:07.550 about
00:05:07.760 half
00:05:07.970 done
00:05:08.330 and
00:05:08.600 I've
00:05:09.170 got
00:05:09.350 such
00:05:09.530 a

00:05:09.560 big
00:05:09.830 pan
00:05:10.070 I
00:05:10.100 got
00:05:10.400 an
00:05:10.520 additional
00:05:11.060 room
00:05:11.300 so

00:05:12.920 on

00:05:13.040 this
00:05:13.190 side
00:05:13.250 so
00:05:13.820 the
00:05:14.450 pan
00:05:14.660 doesn't
00:05:15.020 get
00:05:15.170 too
00:05:15.440 hot

00:05:20.250 and
00:05:20.370 I
00:05:20.760 can
00:05:20.940 still
00:05:21.210 maintain
00:05:21.390 the
00:05:21.810 temperature

00:05:22.020 in
00:05:22.350 my
00:05:22.470 pants

00:05:25.800 keep
00:05:26.699 moving

00:05:30.270 on

00:05:30.389 that
00:05:30.659 first
00:05:31.110 batch
00:05:31.520 I'm
00:05:32.520 not
00:05:32.699 going
00:05:32.849 to
00:05:32.909 even

00:05:32.970 think
00:05:33.240 about
00:05:33.330 the
00:05:33.629 lap
00:05:33.810 when
00:05:34.050 there's
00:05:34.199 just

00:05:34.349 one
00:05:34.530 end

00:05:36.010 and
00:05:36.490 this
00:05:36.760 keeps
00:05:36.970 a
00:05:37.240 deep
00:05:37.990 sauteing
00:05:38.770 your
00:05:38.830 beef

00:05:39.040 until
00:05:39.400 it
00:05:39.490 gets
00:05:39.670 very
00:05:39.820 well
00:05:40.420 browned

00:05:43.100 after

00:05:46.910 these

00:05:47.060 great
00:05:47.240 pan
00:05:47.630 Jews
00:05:47.870 so
00:05:48.260 we're
00:05:48.410 going
00:05:48.530 to
00:05:48.590 be

00:05:48.740 glazed

00:05:49.580 red
00:05:49.820 one
00:05:50.030 I
00:05:50.390 don't

00:05:50.720 need
00:05:50.930 to

00:05:57.200 loosen

00:05:57.620 them
00:05:57.740 up
00:05:57.890 then
00:05:58.490 I'll
00:05:58.610 go

00:06:03.980 pot
00:06:04.010 which
00:06:04.550 makes

00:06:04.790 this
00:06:04.940 really
00:06:05.180 simple
00:06:05.690 and
00:06:06.380 you
00:06:06.830 don't
00:06:06.920 have
00:06:07.100 to

00:06:07.220 worry
00:06:07.370 about
00:06:07.430 others

00:06:12.260 red
00:06:12.530 one
00:06:13.720 alrighty
00:06:14.720 so
00:06:14.810 let's
00:06:15.080 the
00:06:15.590 glaze
00:06:15.800 the

00:06:16.220 it's
00:06:16.460 still
00:06:16.760 steaming
00:06:17.120 hot
00:06:17.450 that's
00:06:17.750 okay

00:06:18.110 just
00:06:18.320 as
00:06:18.530 long
00:06:18.650 as
00:06:18.800 we

00:06:31.500 around
00:06:31.650 like
00:06:31.830 that
00:06:32.100 but
00:06:32.340 let

00:06:32.460 it
00:06:32.580 reduce
00:06:32.700 for
00:06:32.880 a
00:06:33.120 couple
