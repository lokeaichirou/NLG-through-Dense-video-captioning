00:00:04.770 really

00:00:05.040 simple

00:00:05.549 make
00:00:05.580 it's
00:00:05.970 delicious
00:00:06.540 and
00:00:06.720 I've

00:00:07.290 never
00:00:07.470 met
00:00:07.770 a
00:00:07.799 person
00:00:07.950 who
00:00:08.400 doesn't
00:00:08.940 like

00:00:09.420 parm
00:00:09.660 so

00:00:10.440 make
00:00:10.679 it
00:00:10.710 now

00:00:11.400 let's
00:00:11.580 get
00:00:11.759 started
00:00:13.130 so
00:00:14.130 in
00:00:14.250 total
00:00:14.460 I'll
00:00:14.759 be

00:00:14.880 using
00:00:15.059 two
00:00:15.420 chicken
00:00:15.780 breasts
00:00:16.049 which
00:00:16.410 I'm

00:00:16.560 going
00:00:16.740 to
00:00:16.830 butterfly
00:00:17.400 like
00:00:17.640 this
00:00:17.910 you
00:00:18.510 want
00:00:18.720 to

00:00:18.810 slide
00:00:19.230 a
00:00:19.260 knife
00:00:19.619 through
00:00:20.010 it
00:00:20.160 almost
00:00:20.789 all
00:00:20.939 the

00:00:21.060 way
00:00:21.180 I'd
00:00:21.689 open
00:00:21.960 it
00:00:22.080 like
00:00:22.260 a
00:00:22.410 book
00:00:22.619 you
00:00:23.220 do
00:00:23.369 not

00:00:23.519 have
00:00:23.699 to
00:00:23.820 butterfly
00:00:24.210 your
00:00:24.420 chicken
00:00:24.810 however

00:00:25.590 if
00:00:25.890 the
00:00:26.099 chicken
00:00:26.430 breast
00:00:26.640 is
00:00:26.789 too
00:00:27.000 thick

00:00:27.570 you
00:00:27.930 won't
00:00:28.170 be
00:00:28.349 able
00:00:28.470 to
00:00:28.619 taste
00:00:28.949 much
00:00:29.369 of
00:00:29.550 the

00:00:29.670 breading
00:00:30.060 or
00:00:30.210 cheese
00:00:30.480 and
00:00:30.750 I
00:00:31.080 like
00:00:31.230 to
00:00:31.439 taste
00:00:31.740 a

00:00:31.890 bit
00:00:32.040 of
00:00:32.130 everything
00:00:32.369 so
00:00:33.059 this
00:00:33.210 is
00:00:33.329 the
00:00:33.450 second

00:00:34.050 chicken
00:00:34.380 breast
00:00:34.590 which
00:00:34.829 I'm
00:00:35.010 also
00:00:35.250 going
00:00:35.579 to

00:00:35.670 butterfly
00:00:36.180 I'm
00:00:36.719 going
00:00:36.930 to
00:00:37.020 remove
00:00:37.290 most
00:00:37.680 of

00:00:37.890 the
00:00:37.980 fat
00:00:38.250 and
00:00:38.550 had
00:00:38.670 a
00:00:38.700 lot
00:00:38.969 of
00:00:39.090 fat
00:00:39.559 so
00:00:40.559 when
00:00:40.710 you

00:00:40.800 slice
00:00:41.070 the
00:00:41.340 fat
00:00:41.610 off
00:00:41.790 your
00:00:41.820 chicken
00:00:42.360 it
00:00:42.600 should

00:00:42.780 just
00:00:42.930 slide
00:00:43.050 off
00:00:43.500 if
00:00:43.800 your
00:00:44.340 knife
00:00:44.520 is
00:00:44.789 giving

00:00:45.120 you
00:00:45.210 a
00:00:45.329 hard
00:00:45.360 time

00:00:46.050 I
00:00:46.079 suggest
00:00:46.590 you
00:00:46.680 sharpen
00:00:47.070 your
00:00:47.160 knife

00:00:47.510 remember
00:00:48.510 a
00:00:48.539 sharp
00:00:48.840 knife
00:00:48.989 is
00:00:49.200 safer
00:00:49.530 than
00:00:49.620 a

00:00:49.680 dull
00:00:49.980 knife
00:00:50.190 I
00:00:50.460 use
00:00:50.850 some
00:00:51.120 plastic
00:00:51.300 wrap
00:00:51.750 on

00:00:51.899 both
00:00:52.140 sides
00:00:52.469 if
00:00:52.949 you
00:00:53.340 only
00:00:53.489 use
00:00:53.579 plastic
00:00:54.149 on

00:00:54.270 top
00:00:54.300 your
00:00:54.809 chicken
00:00:55.140 will
00:00:55.350 slide
00:00:55.649 around
00:00:55.980 while

00:00:56.219 you
00:00:56.309 pound
00:00:56.579 it
00:00:56.730 I
00:00:57.000 don't
00:00:57.780 have
00:00:57.960 a
00:00:57.989 meat
00:00:58.289 mallet

00:00:58.500 so
00:00:58.710 I
00:00:58.980 used
00:00:59.190 a
00:00:59.640 rolling
00:01:00.180 pin
00:01:00.390 or
00:01:00.660 a
00:01:00.750 rock

00:01:01.230 whichever
00:01:01.800 is
00:01:01.920 closer

00:01:02.280 be
00:01:02.910 classy
00:01:03.390 and
00:01:03.510 using
00:01:03.809 meat
00:01:03.960 mallet
00:01:04.170 don't

00:01:05.100 pound
00:01:05.339 the
00:01:05.489 chicken
00:01:05.850 on
00:01:05.970 the
00:01:06.060 same
00:01:06.270 spot
00:01:06.600 or

00:01:06.869 else
00:01:07.049 you'll
00:01:07.290 get
00:01:07.439 holes
00:01:07.740 in
00:01:07.950 the
00:01:08.070 chicken
00:01:08.460 and

00:01:08.670 you
00:01:08.939 don't
00:01:09.180 want
00:01:09.360 any
00:01:09.479 holy
00:01:09.750 chicken
00:01:10.170 if
00:01:10.710 you

00:01:11.310 watch

00:01:15.240 thin
00:01:15.479 you

00:01:15.720 can
00:01:16.259 certainly
00:01:16.530 pound
00:01:17.009 it
00:01:17.189 out
00:01:17.280 back
00:01:17.610 then
00:01:17.850 it

00:01:21.630 the

00:01:33.960 my

00:01:34.079 grandmother

00:01:34.619 over
00:01:34.860 my
00:01:35.009 house

00:01:35.579 recording
00:01:35.970 this

00:01:37.320 eye

00:01:37.350 on

00:01:43.079 grandma

00:01:43.770 all

00:01:44.850 your
00:01:45.090 chicken
00:01:45.119 breast
00:01:45.689 on

00:01:45.810 both
00:01:46.020 sides
00:01:46.380 with
00:01:46.829 flour
00:01:47.220 that
00:01:47.640 little
00:01:47.880 part

00:01:48.119 didn't
00:01:48.390 want
00:01:48.509 to
00:01:48.600 get
00:01:48.720 coated
00:01:48.960 but
00:01:49.380 I

00:01:50.790 excess
00:01:51.149 flour
00:01:51.360 and
00:01:51.780 then

00:01:52.259 we're
00:01:52.439 going
00:01:52.560 to
00:01:52.740 coat
00:01:52.920 the
00:01:53.070 chicken
00:01:53.399 and
00:01:53.549 egg

00:01:53.640 I
00:01:53.909 like
00:01:54.329 to
00:01:54.479 use
00:01:54.600 one
00:01:54.899 egg
00:01:55.110 per
00:01:55.140 chicken
00:01:55.680 so
00:01:55.950 I

00:01:56.009 use
00:01:56.189 two
00:01:56.490 eggs
00:01:56.520 total
00:01:57.240 and
00:01:57.840 you
00:01:57.930 need
00:01:58.079 bags
00:01:58.320 so

00:01:58.530 the
00:01:58.649 breadcrumbs
00:01:59.130 stick
00:01:59.369 I
00:01:59.820 used
00:02:00.420 regular

00:02:01.049 store-bought
00:02:01.439 breadcrumbs
00:02:02.219 I
00:02:02.549 don't
00:02:03.060 like
00:02:03.210 to

00:02:03.360 use
00:02:03.390 panko
00:02:03.840 breadcrumbs
00:02:04.530 for
00:02:04.770 this
00:02:04.950 but
00:02:05.250 you

00:02:05.280 can
00:02:05.369 use
00:02:05.700 your
00:02:05.850 favorite
00:02:06.240 breadcrumbs
00:02:06.719 you

00:02:06.930 can
00:02:07.409 even
00:02:07.560 make
00:02:07.740 your
00:02:07.799 own
00:02:07.950 make

00:02:10.229 piece
00:02:10.379 of
00:02:10.440 the
00:02:10.679 chicken

00:02:10.709 breadcrumbs
00:02:11.670 also
00:02:12.480 I
00:02:12.510 think
00:02:12.629 it's
00:02:12.900 a
00:02:12.989 great

00:02:13.110 idea
00:02:13.349 to

00:02:13.840 make
00:02:13.930 a
00:02:13.959 few
00:02:14.319 extra
00:02:14.500 of
00:02:14.860 these
00:02:15.099 and
00:02:15.370 keep
00:02:15.550 them

00:02:15.760 in
00:02:15.849 the
00:02:15.970 fridge
00:02:16.180 you'll
00:02:17.170 be
00:02:17.290 happy
00:02:17.590 you
00:02:17.620 did

00:02:17.890 later
00:02:18.190 on
00:02:18.280 in
00:02:18.489 the
00:02:18.580 week
00:02:18.700 alright
00:02:19.390 so
00:02:19.599 make

00:02:19.840 sure
00:02:19.870 you
00:02:20.200 use
00:02:20.230 enough
00:02:20.650 special
00:02:21.129 oil
00:02:21.489 to
00:02:21.640 fry

00:02:21.790 these
00:02:21.910 in
00:02:22.269 you
00:02:22.900 just
00:02:23.110 have
00:02:23.230 to
00:02:23.319 make
00:02:23.500 sure

00:02:23.530 every
00:02:24.160 bit
00:02:24.459 of
00:02:24.489 breadcrumbs
00:02:25.209 touches
00:02:25.599 oil

00:02:27.940 each
00:02:28.000 side
00:02:28.450 I

00:02:30.940 the
00:02:31.030 same
00:02:31.239 time
00:02:31.480 but
00:02:31.810 I

00:02:31.870 then
00:02:32.080 decided
00:02:32.410 not
00:02:32.650 to
00:02:32.709 we

00:02:38.379 the
00:02:38.410 excess
00:02:38.860 oil

00:02:39.430 you
00:02:39.489 don't

00:02:39.640 have
00:02:39.790 to
00:02:39.970 I
00:02:40.180 honestly
00:02:40.959 could
00:02:41.260 have

00:02:55.780 you

00:02:56.410 to
00:02:56.500 add
00:02:56.709 sauce

00:02:57.040 on

00:02:57.730 and
00:02:57.970 the

00:02:58.390 I
00:02:58.720 only
00:02:59.290 had
00:02:59.500 it

00:02:59.620 an

00:03:04.390 mozzarella
00:03:04.690 but

00:03:06.340 it

00:03:06.940 I
00:03:07.060 honestly

00:03:18.040 on
00:03:18.280 the

00:03:18.579 so
00:03:19.060 the
