00:00:10.349 there
00:00:11.070 are
00:00:11.190 times

00:00:11.490 that
00:00:11.730 you
00:00:11.969 don't
00:00:12.179 think
00:00:12.450 far
00:00:12.690 enough
00:00:12.870 ahead

00:00:13.080 and
00:00:13.500 you
00:00:13.980 have
00:00:14.099 to
00:00:14.219 buy
00:00:14.370 frozen
00:00:14.670 bratwurst

00:00:15.330 again
00:00:16.260 the
00:00:16.529 bun
00:00:16.770 warmer
00:00:17.010 is
00:00:17.490 perfect
00:00:18.210 put
00:00:18.810 your

00:00:19.020 frozen
00:00:19.289 brats
00:00:19.740 up
00:00:20.010 on
00:00:20.160 the
00:00:20.250 bun
00:00:20.460 warmer
00:00:20.750 close

00:00:21.750 your
00:00:22.050 lid
00:00:22.289 and
00:00:22.560 in
00:00:23.100 about
00:00:23.400 five
00:00:23.789 to
00:00:24.119 eight

00:00:24.269 minutes
00:00:24.300 they
00:00:24.960 will
00:00:25.109 be
00:00:25.230 pretty
00:00:25.500 well
00:00:25.740 fought

00:00:26.039 and
00:00:26.430 then
00:00:26.880 you
00:00:26.970 can
00:00:27.090 start
00:00:27.300 cooking
00:00:27.480 them
00:00:27.750 near

00:00:27.930 the
00:00:28.080 fire
00:00:28.289 I
00:00:28.650 never
00:00:29.460 ever
00:00:29.789 put
00:00:30.150 brats
00:00:30.420 over
00:00:30.840 the

00:00:30.960 fire
00:00:31.170 directly
00:00:31.740 I
00:00:32.009 use
00:00:32.550 the
00:00:32.790 indirect
00:00:33.360 method

00:00:33.530 because
00:00:34.530 I
00:00:34.829 want
00:00:35.399 them
00:00:35.579 to
00:00:35.700 cook
00:00:35.880 slow
00:00:36.300 and
00:00:36.660 be

00:00:37.140 more
00:00:37.500 flavorful
00:00:38.540 also
00:00:39.540 turn
00:00:39.960 them
00:00:40.230 often
00:00:40.920 you

00:00:41.460 don't
00:00:41.700 want
00:00:42.000 them
00:00:42.290 cooking
00:00:43.290 real
00:00:43.680 fast
00:00:44.040 and

00:00:44.370 getting
00:00:44.640 burned
00:00:44.879 on
00:00:45.090 the
00:00:45.120 outside
00:00:45.239 I
00:00:45.899 believe

00:00:46.410 the
00:00:46.620 most
00:00:46.770 important
00:00:47.370 thing
00:00:47.520 to
00:00:47.610 remember

00:00:47.670 when
00:00:47.940 you
00:00:48.120 cook
00:00:48.329 abroad
00:00:48.690 is
00:00:48.930 not
00:00:49.260 to
00:00:49.980 pierce

00:00:50.280 the
00:00:50.550 skin
00:00:50.930 that'll
00:00:51.930 not
00:00:52.230 only
00:00:52.559 cause
00:00:52.800 a
00:00:52.829 flame

00:00:53.370 up
00:00:53.579 in
00:00:53.730 your
00:00:53.879 fire
00:00:54.120 but
00:00:54.719 it'll
00:00:54.899 dry
00:00:55.170 the
00:00:55.230 meat

00:00:55.500 out
00:00:55.710 and
00:00:55.739 make
00:00:56.070 them
00:00:56.250 tough
00:00:56.579 people
00:00:57.390 will
00:00:57.510 say

00:00:57.719 oh
00:00:57.870 yes
00:00:58.199 is
00:00:58.410 a
00:00:58.559 terrible
00:00:59.070 rot
00:00:59.340 when
00:00:59.760 it
00:00:59.879 maybe

00:01:00.090 have
00:01:00.329 been
00:01:00.960 a
00:01:00.989 good
00:01:01.230 one
00:01:01.440 especially
00:01:01.980 from
00:01:02.640 one

00:01:02.760 of
00:01:02.850 your
00:01:02.940 local
00:01:03.180 folks
00:01:03.539 who
00:01:03.690 makes
00:01:03.930 them
00:01:04.170 fresh

00:01:04.949 and
00:01:05.299 you'll
00:01:06.299 just
00:01:06.479 have
00:01:06.689 a
00:01:06.720 lot
00:01:07.020 better
00:01:07.260 Brock

00:01:07.650 don't
00:01:08.040 break
00:01:08.610 the
00:01:08.939 skin
00:01:09.180 number
00:01:10.110 one
00:01:10.350 don't

00:01:10.979 use
00:01:11.189 your
00:01:11.430 fork
00:01:11.760 to
00:01:12.330 turn
00:01:12.540 the
00:01:12.659 brats
00:01:12.869 over
00:01:13.229 use

00:01:13.770 the
00:01:14.040 tongs
00:01:14.310 don't
00:01:15.270 grip
00:01:15.509 them
00:01:15.689 real
00:01:15.930 tightly

00:01:16.380 when
00:01:16.530 you
00:01:16.650 turn
00:01:16.920 them
00:01:17.070 over
00:01:17.220 because
00:01:18.030 the

00:01:18.180 tongs
00:01:18.450 can
00:01:18.750 break
00:01:18.990 the
00:01:19.140 skin
00:01:19.409 when
00:01:19.920 I'm

00:01:20.070 cooking
00:01:20.280 brats
00:01:20.729 I
00:01:20.939 will
00:01:21.090 normally
00:01:21.420 close
00:01:21.720 the

00:01:21.960 lid
00:01:22.170 for
00:01:22.920 a
00:01:22.950 minute
00:01:23.250 minute
00:01:23.460 and
00:01:23.670 a
00:01:23.700 half
00:01:23.820 at
00:01:24.060 a

00:01:24.119 time
00:01:24.360 when
00:01:24.960 I
00:01:24.990 know
00:01:25.110 they're
00:01:25.439 safely
00:01:25.830 not
00:01:25.979 near

00:01:26.250 where
00:01:26.430 the
00:01:26.549 fire
00:01:26.790 is
00:01:26.820 because
00:01:27.780 that
00:01:27.960 X
00:01:28.200 more

00:01:28.380 like
00:01:28.560 an
00:01:28.680 oven
00:01:28.920 din
00:01:29.310 and
00:01:29.549 gets
00:01:30.030 the
00:01:30.180 heat

00:01:30.360 around
00:01:30.509 them
00:01:30.900 quicker
00:01:31.170 I
00:01:31.500 think
00:01:32.009 that
00:01:32.400 to
00:01:32.640 make

00:01:32.820 a
00:01:32.850 good
00:01:33.000 broth
00:01:33.509 it
00:01:33.840 will
00:01:34.020 usually
00:01:34.170 take
00:01:34.470 15
00:01:34.979 to

00:01:35.100 20
00:01:35.430 minutes
00:01:35.790 because
00:01:36.329 you
00:01:36.659 want
00:01:36.930 to
00:01:37.049 cook
00:01:37.200 them

00:01:37.409 slowly
00:01:38.000 often
00:01:39.000 you
00:01:39.119 can
00:01:39.299 start
00:01:39.619 your
00:01:40.619 brats

00:01:40.920 first
00:01:41.430 and
00:01:41.790 then
00:01:42.299 do
00:01:42.509 your
00:01:42.899 hamburgers
00:01:43.500 or

00:01:43.799 your
00:01:43.920 hot
00:01:44.100 dogs
00:01:44.369 after
00:01:45.329 that
00:01:45.509 if
00:01:45.659 you're
00:01:45.780 doing

00:01:45.899 a
00:01:46.110 mixed
00:01:46.619 grill
00:01:46.890 for
