00:00:57.909 with
00:00:58.030 cold

00:00:58.210 water
00:00:58.480 because
00:00:58.750 when
00:00:59.050 they
00:00:59.199 when
00:01:00.070 the
00:01:00.670 when

00:01:01.210 the
00:01:01.300 cold
00:01:01.510 water
00:01:01.720 goes
00:01:01.989 to
00:01:02.199 boiling
00:01:02.440 point

00:01:02.800 that
00:01:03.220 way
00:01:03.370 the
00:01:03.489 potato
00:01:03.789 gets
00:01:04.030 cook
00:01:04.239 really

00:01:04.839 fully
00:01:05.199 all
00:01:05.440 the
00:01:05.560 way
00:01:05.649 through
00:01:05.890 evenly
00:01:06.670 if
00:01:07.270 you

00:01:07.360 put
00:01:07.570 the
00:01:07.690 potatoes
00:01:08.050 in
00:01:08.110 boiling
00:01:08.170 water
00:01:08.500 the

00:01:09.220 very
00:01:09.369 outside
00:01:09.880 of
00:01:10.000 the
00:01:10.060 potato
00:01:10.390 starts
00:01:10.660 to
00:01:10.720 get

00:01:10.810 cooked
00:01:10.990 right
00:01:11.289 away
00:01:11.500 while
00:01:11.979 the
00:01:12.100 inside

00:01:12.430 hasn't
00:01:12.729 had
00:01:12.910 a
00:01:12.970 chance
00:01:13.090 to
00:01:13.270 cook
00:01:13.390 yet
00:01:13.630 so
00:01:13.990 that

00:01:14.170 makes
00:01:14.380 it
00:01:14.560 uneven
00:01:15.160 and
00:01:15.490 not
00:01:15.910 very
00:01:16.000 good
00:01:16.240 now

00:01:16.660 I'm
00:01:16.899 using
00:01:17.170 a
00:01:17.320 potato
00:01:17.590 ricer
00:01:17.860 to
00:01:18.250 get
00:01:18.550 these

00:01:18.700 nice
00:01:18.880 and
00:01:18.910 fluffy
00:01:19.240 which
00:01:19.630 means
00:01:19.869 I
00:01:19.990 don't
00:01:20.110 need

00:01:20.200 to
00:01:20.289 peel
00:01:20.500 them
00:01:20.649 because
00:01:21.039 a
00:01:21.070 potato
00:01:21.429 ricer

00:01:22.450 catches
00:01:23.110 the
00:01:23.229 skin
00:01:23.560 so
00:01:24.240 that's
00:01:25.240 another

00:01:25.420 reason
00:01:25.630 why
00:01:25.780 I
00:01:25.810 love
00:01:25.960 the
00:01:26.080 potato
00:01:26.380 ricer
00:01:26.740 but

00:01:27.369 if
00:01:27.610 you
00:01:27.729 want
00:01:27.910 to
00:01:27.970 use
00:01:28.090 this
00:01:28.179 a
00:01:28.240 regular
00:01:28.630 masher

00:01:29.080 then
00:01:29.500 I
00:01:29.560 will
00:01:29.679 suggest
00:01:29.800 you
00:01:30.160 peel
00:01:30.369 them
00:01:30.520 first

00:01:30.600 and
00:01:31.600 all
00:01:31.990 I'm
00:01:32.140 doing
00:01:32.470 is
00:01:32.619 just
00:01:32.710 quartering

00:01:34.090 big
00:01:34.300 ones
00:01:34.509 and
00:01:34.860 having
00:01:35.860 the
00:01:35.979 little

00:01:36.159 ones
00:01:36.689 and
00:01:37.689 then
00:01:37.840 I'm
00:01:37.930 just
00:01:37.990 going
00:01:38.140 to
00:01:38.200 put

00:01:38.439 these

00:02:34.660 and

00:02:34.930 that's
00:02:35.200 it
00:02:35.440 now
00:02:35.890 the
00:02:35.950 consistency
00:02:36.459 of
00:02:36.850 this
00:02:37.209 is

00:02:37.390 completely
00:02:37.630 up
00:02:38.350 to
00:02:38.380 you
00:02:38.650 some
00:02:39.010 people
00:02:39.370 like

00:02:39.489 them
00:02:39.670 really
00:02:40.120 thick
00:02:40.360 and
00:02:40.540 chunky
00:02:40.690 some
00:02:41.170 people

00:02:41.379 like
00:02:41.500 them
00:02:41.650 super
00:02:42.250 creamy
00:02:42.519 and
00:02:42.700 loose
00:02:42.879 I
00:02:43.660 like

00:02:44.170 it
00:02:44.290 somewhere
00:02:44.620 in
00:02:44.680 between

00:02:44.960 I
00:02:45.020 guess
00:02:45.400 but
00:02:46.400 you
00:02:46.700 know
00:02:47.120 it's
00:02:47.360 like
00:02:47.720 I
00:02:47.810 said

00:02:47.900 it's
00:02:48.140 totally
00:02:48.410 optional
00:02:48.830 so
00:02:49.700 I'm
00:02:49.790 just
00:02:50.000 gonna

00:02:50.150 work
00:02:50.390 this
00:02:50.600 in
00:02:50.840 little
00:02:51.350 by
00:02:51.620 little
00:02:51.860 you
00:02:52.010 don't

00:02:52.130 want
00:02:52.250 to
00:02:52.310 start
00:02:52.490 with
00:02:52.550 too
00:02:52.850 much
00:02:53.000 because
00:02:53.420 then

00:02:53.570 it's
00:02:53.720 going
00:02:54.230 to
00:02:54.290 be
00:02:54.410 difficult
00:02:54.800 to
00:02:54.830 take
00:02:55.070 it

00:02:55.190 out
00:02:55.310 if
00:02:55.520 you've
00:02:55.670 overdone
00:02:56.000 it
00:02:56.060 I'm
00:02:56.990 going
00:02:57.170 to

00:02:57.230 just
00:02:57.410 season
00:02:58.070 it
00:02:58.340 you
00:02:58.460 want
00:02:58.610 to
00:02:58.670 season
00:02:58.820 it

00:02:59.030 well
00:02:59.240 my
00:03:00.050 mother
00:03:00.290 is
00:03:00.380 what
00:03:00.560 my
00:03:00.890 mother
00:03:01.070 would

00:03:01.160 have
00:03:01.250 a
00:03:01.340 heart
00:03:01.370 attack
00:03:01.580 right
00:03:01.760 now
00:03:01.940 because

00:03:02.300 I'm
00:03:02.390 using
00:03:02.420 black
00:03:02.780 pepper
00:03:03.050 she
00:03:03.410 uses
00:03:03.710 white

00:03:03.890 pepper
00:03:04.160 but
00:03:04.790 she's
00:03:04.970 not
00:03:05.090 here
00:03:05.480 so
00:03:05.540 I
00:03:06.200 do
00:03:07.190 what
00:03:07.430 I

00:03:07.940 season
00:03:08.690 it
00:03:08.780 well
00:03:08.900 with
00:03:09.020 salt
00:03:09.260 because

00:03:09.470 potatoes
00:03:10.010 are
00:03:10.190 just
00:03:10.220 very
00:03:10.580 very
00:03:10.640 bland
00:03:11.090 and

00:03:11.390 they
00:03:11.750 don't
00:03:11.900 taste
00:03:12.080 like
00:03:12.170 anything
00:03:12.590 unless

00:03:12.980 you
00:03:13.040 salt
00:03:13.430 them
00:03:14.590 touch
00:03:15.590 more
00:03:15.830 cream
00:03:17.230 and
00:03:18.230 then

00:03:18.320 this
00:03:18.470 consistency
00:03:19.040 is
00:03:19.220 perfect
00:03:19.250 for
00:03:19.910 me
00:03:20.060 so

00:03:20.510 I'm
00:03:20.600 going
00:03:20.780 to
00:03:20.810 stop
00:03:21.050 but
00:03:21.680 again
00:03:22.220 you
00:03:22.700 can

00:03:22.880 control
00:03:23.210 however
00:03:23.690 you
00:03:23.900 like
00:03:24.140 it
00:03:24.380 now
00:03:25.040 I'm
00:03:25.130 just

00:03:25.250 going
00:03:25.400 to
00:03:25.430 put
00:03:25.580 in
00:03:25.670 a
00:03:25.730 bowl
00:03:25.910 and
00:03:26.240 we're
00:03:26.420 pretty

00:03:26.600 much
00:03:26.720 done
00:03:27.050 now
00:03:27.320 with
00:03:27.920 Thanksgiving
00:03:28.460 run

00:03:28.610 around
00:03:28.700 the
00:03:28.880 corner
00:03:29.060 you
00:03:29.420 know
00:03:29.450 everyone's

00:03:30.440 going
00:03:30.530 to
00:03:30.590 have
00:03:30.710 mashed
00:03:30.980 potatoes
00:03:31.460 and
00:03:31.670 I
00:03:32.120 know

00:03:32.210 quite
00:03:32.810 a
00:03:32.870 few
00:03:33.140 people
00:03:33.350 we're

00:03:34.670 out
00:03:34.820 of
00:03:34.850 the
00:03:34.940 box
00:03:35.120 and
00:03:35.450 I
00:03:35.960 think

00:03:35.990 that
00:03:36.650 that
00:03:36.800 is
00:03:37.000 tragedy
00:03:38.000 because
00:03:38.450 you
00:03:38.570 can

00:03:38.720 make
00:03:38.930 it
00:03:39.050 from
00:03:39.140 scratch
00:03:39.320 you
00:03:40.040 can
00:03:40.190 make
00:03:40.310 it

00:03:40.430 super
00:03:40.790 easy
00:03:40.970 it's
00:03:41.300 not
00:03:41.600 expensive
00:03:42.050 and
00:03:42.560 it's

00:03:43.070 so
00:03:43.340 like
00:03:43.640 how
00:03:43.820 long
00:03:43.970 did
00:03:44.120 it
00:03:44.180 take
00:03:44.240 I
00:03:44.390 mean
00:03:44.570 you

00:03:44.690 really
00:03:44.810 didn't
00:03:45.020 do
