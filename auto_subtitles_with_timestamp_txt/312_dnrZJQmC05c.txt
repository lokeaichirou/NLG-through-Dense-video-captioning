00:00:02.730 cradle
00:00:02.970 here
00:00:03.419 I
00:00:03.589 wanted
00:00:04.589 to
00:00:04.650 make

00:00:04.859 something
00:00:05.210 authentic
00:00:06.210 and
00:00:06.390 delicious
00:00:06.680 for
00:00:07.680 my

00:00:07.830 family
00:00:08.189 for
00:00:08.400 st.
00:00:08.610 Patrick's
00:00:08.970 Day
00:00:09.080 so
00:00:10.080 I

00:00:10.110 decided
00:00:10.500 to
00:00:10.620 make
00:00:10.889 cold
00:00:11.400 canon
00:00:11.910 a
00:00:12.410 lot
00:00:13.410 of

00:00:13.530 dishes
00:00:13.650 we
00:00:13.950 serve
00:00:14.160 for
00:00:14.400 st.
00:00:14.580 Patrick's
00:00:15.000 Day

00:00:15.059 are
00:00:15.240 not
00:00:15.420 authentic
00:00:15.870 but
00:00:16.199 this
00:00:16.410 one
00:00:16.590 is
00:00:16.890 I'm

00:00:17.760 using
00:00:18.090 potatoes
00:00:18.570 that
00:00:18.779 I
00:00:18.810 can't
00:00:19.140 about
00:00:19.470 a
00:00:19.500 year

00:00:19.920 and
00:00:19.980 a
00:00:20.039 half
00:00:20.250 ago
00:00:20.430 and
00:00:20.960 they
00:00:21.960 look
00:00:22.199 beautiful

00:00:23.160 i
00:00:23.960 drained
00:00:24.960 the
00:00:25.109 potato
00:00:25.500 water
00:00:25.800 off
00:00:26.160 for
00:00:26.789 this

00:00:27.000 recipe
00:00:27.630 but
00:00:27.960 you
00:00:28.019 can
00:00:28.199 bet
00:00:28.619 that
00:00:28.650 if
00:00:29.279 we
00:00:29.849 were

00:00:30.029 in
00:00:30.210 times
00:00:30.539 of
00:00:31.019 scarcity
00:00:31.920 I
00:00:32.669 would
00:00:32.969 probably
00:00:33.180 be

00:00:33.600 using
00:00:34.020 that
00:00:34.170 potato
00:00:34.530 water
00:00:34.800 for
00:00:35.070 something

00:00:35.399 else
00:00:35.579 like
00:00:35.820 to
00:00:35.969 make
00:00:36.149 bread
00:00:36.710 so
00:00:37.710 I've
00:00:37.800 drained

00:00:38.010 them
00:00:38.219 off

00:00:46.620 and
