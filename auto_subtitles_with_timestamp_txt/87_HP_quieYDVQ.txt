00:00:31.619 I
00:00:31.800 wanted

00:02:00.400 big

00:02:00.970 difference
00:02:01.300 as

00:02:02.890 levitation
00:02:03.580 odd
00:02:03.760 my

00:02:04.420 very
00:02:04.810 natural

00:02:05.020 no
00:02:05.380 refrigeration
00:02:06.040 and
00:02:06.660 you

00:02:10.360 the
00:02:10.479 same

00:02:10.690 thing
00:02:11.020 that
00:02:11.140 I
00:02:11.230 do
00:02:11.290 every
00:02:11.680 day
00:02:11.830 and
00:02:12.010 and
00:02:12.640 it
00:02:12.790 was

00:02:12.910 a
00:02:12.970 great
00:02:13.300 result
00:02:15.810 okay
00:02:16.810 so
00:02:16.870 I'm
00:02:17.200 going
00:02:17.350 to
00:02:17.380 show

00:02:17.560 you
00:02:17.650 how
00:02:17.800 to
00:02:17.860 make
00:02:18.100 a
00:02:18.400 world-class
00:02:18.940 margarita

00:02:19.540 pizza
00:02:19.750 now
00:02:20.200 a
00:02:20.230 lot
00:02:20.410 of
00:02:20.530 people
00:02:20.770 actually
00:02:20.860 think

00:02:21.220 that
00:02:21.400 margarita
00:02:21.880 beats
00:02:22.120 is
00:02:22.240 one
00:02:22.420 of
00:02:22.510 the

00:02:22.570 easiest
00:02:22.900 pizzas
00:02:23.260 to
00:02:23.380 produce
00:02:23.530 well
00:02:24.280 let
00:02:24.430 me

00:02:24.460 tell
00:02:24.700 you
00:02:24.820 it's
00:02:24.910 actually
00:02:25.090 one
00:02:25.390 of
00:02:25.420 the

00:02:25.540 hottest
00:02:25.720 feeds
00:02:26.050 that
00:02:26.170 are
00:02:26.260 produced
00:02:26.590 because

00:02:27.040 you're
00:02:27.520 only
00:02:27.640 using
00:02:27.910 four
00:02:28.600 four
00:02:28.990 ingredients

00:02:29.200 so
00:02:29.710 it's
00:02:29.860 really
00:02:30.250 hard
00:02:30.850 to
00:02:31.060 mask
00:02:31.840 if
00:02:32.110 your

00:02:32.560 dough
00:02:32.710 hasn't
00:02:33.070 been
00:02:33.190 produced
00:02:33.580 right
00:02:33.790 and
00:02:34.510 if

00:02:34.630 you're
00:02:34.750 not
00:02:34.900 using
00:02:35.140 high
00:02:35.410 quality

00:02:35.440 ingredients
00:02:36.010 the
00:02:36.610 reason
00:02:37.000 is
00:02:37.120 that
00:02:37.150 we
00:02:37.480 try

00:02:37.720 and
00:02:37.840 entrap
00:02:38.170 all
00:02:38.470 the
00:02:38.650 gasses
00:02:39.070 all
00:02:39.280 the
00:02:39.430 air

00:02:39.610 into
00:02:40.000 the
00:02:40.120 dough
00:02:40.300 so
00:02:40.720 we
00:02:40.870 create
00:02:41.200 a
00:02:41.260 nice

00:02:41.530 Courtney
00:02:41.980 shawnee
00:02:42.370 which
00:02:42.520 is
00:02:42.670 the
00:02:42.790 crust

00:02:43.090 we're
00:02:43.570 not
00:02:43.690 going
00:02:43.840 to
00:02:43.870 use
00:02:44.050 any
00:02:44.230 rolling
00:02:44.500 pins

00:02:44.860 as
00:02:45.040 a
00:02:45.070 lot
00:02:45.310 of
00:02:45.340 people
00:02:45.430 do
00:02:45.730 at
00:02:45.850 home
00:02:46.030 we're

00:02:46.360 going
00:02:46.510 to
00:02:46.570 use
00:02:46.750 only
00:02:46.990 our
00:02:47.410 hands
00:02:47.830 with

00:02:48.220 practice
00:02:48.730 you
00:02:49.060 are
00:02:49.210 obviously
00:02:49.420 going
