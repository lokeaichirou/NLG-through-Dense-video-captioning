00:02:43.840 I've

00:02:43.990 sprayed
00:02:44.350 a
00:02:44.530 large
00:02:44.800 pan
00:02:45.130 with
00:02:45.310 some
00:02:45.340 nonstick

00:02:45.820 spray
00:02:45.970 we're

00:02:48.940 cook
00:02:49.150 slowly
00:02:52.680 and

00:02:53.680 I
00:02:53.770 like
00:02:53.950 to
00:02:54.100 use
00:02:54.250 organic
00:02:54.430 eggs

00:02:55.750 egg
00:02:56.170 yolk
00:02:56.470 is

00:03:04.870 bit
00:03:04.960 of
00:03:04.990 salt

00:03:05.290 and
00:03:05.410 pepper

00:03:14.860 my

00:03:29.980 avocado
00:03:30.190 spread
00:03:30.820 that
00:03:31.000 we
00:03:31.090 prepared
00:03:31.480 earlier

00:03:31.630 and
00:03:32.050 I
00:03:32.440 like
00:03:32.620 to
00:03:32.770 add
00:03:32.890 a
00:03:32.920 lot

00:03:36.430 to

00:03:36.520 get
00:03:36.610 a
00:03:36.670 bite
00:03:36.910 of
00:03:36.940 it
00:03:37.150 in
00:03:37.240 every
00:03:37.870 single
00:03:38.110 bite

00:03:41.190 spread
00:03:42.190 that
00:03:42.340 and
00:03:42.580 then
00:03:42.730 on
00:03:42.850 the
00:03:42.970 other
00:03:43.000 side

00:03:48.670 think
00:03:48.880 it
00:03:48.970 has

00:03:49.090 better
00:03:49.810 flavor
