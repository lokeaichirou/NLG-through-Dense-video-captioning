00:00:09.540 trim
00:00:09.870 remove
00:00:10.800 the
00:00:11.010 shell
00:00:11.280 but
00:00:11.550 leave
00:00:11.790 the
00:00:11.969 tail

00:00:12.000 on
00:00:14.330 here's
00:00:15.330 another
00:00:15.719 tip
00:00:16.080 of
00:00:16.320 removing
00:00:16.830 the

00:00:16.980 vein
00:00:17.160 of
00:00:17.369 the
00:00:17.490 shrimp
00:00:24.439 there's
00:00:25.439 a
00:00:25.650 vein
00:00:25.859 on
00:00:25.890 the

00:00:26.189 bottom
00:00:26.580 of
00:00:26.760 the
00:00:26.910 shrimp
00:00:27.269 when
00:00:28.019 you
00:00:28.170 cook
00:00:28.439 it
00:00:28.619 it

00:00:28.800 tends
00:00:29.070 to
00:00:29.189 curls
00:00:29.550 up
00:00:29.880 for
00:00:30.840 this
00:00:31.080 I
00:00:31.289 like
00:00:31.590 to

00:00:31.710 keep
00:00:31.890 my
00:00:32.099 stream
00:00:32.399 straight
00:00:32.790 so
00:00:33.059 I
00:00:33.090 give
00:00:33.420 it
00:00:33.450 a

00:00:33.630 few
00:00:33.870 shallow
00:00:34.200 cuts

00:00:45.780 to
00:00:46.780 marinate
00:00:47.290 the
