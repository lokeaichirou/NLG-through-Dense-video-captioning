00:00:01.340 sauerkraut
00:00:02.340 it's
00:00:02.790 a
00:00:02.939 bit
00:00:03.740 underappreciated
00:00:04.740 I

00:00:04.920 think
00:00:05.190 in
00:00:05.310 my
00:00:05.430 family
00:00:05.879 but
00:00:06.120 I
00:00:06.150 like
00:00:06.420 it
00:00:06.600 so
00:00:06.720 I

00:00:06.750 keep
00:00:07.049 making
00:00:07.290 it
00:00:07.560 and
00:00:08.280 I
00:00:08.400 use
00:00:08.580 it
00:00:08.760 for
00:00:09.179 as

00:00:09.360 a
00:00:09.389 condiment
00:00:09.840 from
00:00:10.050 for
00:00:10.440 me
00:00:10.620 then
00:00:10.920 as
00:00:11.070 a
00:00:11.099 as
00:00:11.790 to

00:00:12.000 put
00:00:12.120 it
00:00:12.240 on
00:00:12.330 some
00:00:12.540 spread
00:00:12.870 or
00:00:13.049 in
00:00:13.110 some
00:00:13.290 salad

00:00:13.710 or
00:00:13.860 so
00:00:14.009 fry
00:00:14.309 it
00:00:14.370 up
00:00:14.490 in
00:00:14.670 some
00:00:14.969 bacon
00:00:15.540 fat
00:00:15.570 and
00:00:15.870 I

00:00:16.379 really
00:00:16.890 like
00:00:17.070 it
00:00:17.250 I
00:00:17.400 even
00:00:17.670 like
00:00:17.910 it
00:00:17.940 raw
00:00:20.000 and
00:00:21.000 on

00:00:21.150 hot
00:00:21.359 dogs
00:00:22.519 now
00:00:23.519 this
00:00:23.789 is
00:00:23.910 all
00:00:24.060 you
00:00:24.090 need
00:00:24.420 to

00:00:24.600 make
00:00:24.630 sauerkraut
00:00:25.050 cabbage
00:00:25.920 salt
00:00:26.550 and
00:00:26.820 some

00:00:26.939 jars
00:00:27.390 to
00:00:27.599 for
00:00:27.750 mints
00:00:31.460 have
00:00:32.460 to
00:00:32.610 ready
00:00:32.820 the

00:00:33.450 cabbage
00:00:33.840 take
00:00:34.320 off
00:00:34.469 the
00:00:34.649 outer
00:00:35.930 leaves
00:00:36.930 if

00:00:37.200 they
00:00:37.320 have
00:00:37.469 any
00:00:37.649 problems
00:00:38.219 take
00:00:39.210 off
00:00:39.360 this

00:00:39.750 stem
00:00:40.469 or
00:00:40.739 the
00:00:40.920 stop
00:00:43.010 like
00:00:44.010 cut
00:00:44.579 a
00:00:44.610 square
00:00:44.850 like

00:00:45.210 or
00:00:45.780 a
00:00:45.840 triangle
00:00:46.530 like
00:00:46.559 this
00:00:46.920 then
00:00:47.730 I
00:00:47.820 can
00:00:47.879 just

00:00:48.149 read
00:00:48.390 me
00:00:48.570 remove
00:00:49.170 the
00:00:49.350 stalk
00:00:50.010 in
00:00:50.160 the
00:00:50.250 middle

00:00:51.199 and
00:00:52.199 I
00:00:52.260 have
00:00:52.379 to
00:00:52.500 measure
00:00:52.710 it
00:00:52.949 and
00:00:53.129 this
00:00:53.820 is

00:00:53.879 about
00:00:54.120 900
00:00:54.690 grams
00:00:54.930 I
00:00:55.289 have
00:00:56.219 to
00:00:56.370 divide
00:00:56.640 that

00:00:56.910 with
00:00:57.090 50
00:00:57.449 and
00:00:57.660 then
00:00:57.780 I
00:00:57.899 have
00:00:58.079 the
00:00:58.289 amount
00:00:58.859 of

00:00:59.070 salt
00:00:59.309 that
00:00:59.399 I
00:00:59.609 need
00:00:59.789 that
00:01:00.090 is
00:01:00.239 2%
00:01:00.600 of
00:01:00.989 the

00:01:01.770 weight
00:01:02.489 of
00:01:02.640 the
00:01:02.760 cabbage
00:01:03.090 has
00:01:03.420 to
00:01:03.600 be
00:01:03.690 solved

00:01:06.320 this
00:01:07.320 is
00:01:07.439 18
00:01:07.830 grams
00:01:08.130 so
00:01:08.939 this
00:01:09.180 is
00:01:09.299 the
00:01:09.450 soul
00:01:09.689 I

00:01:09.720 need
00:01:10.020 for
00:01:10.320 this
00:01:10.500 half
00:01:11.010 cabbage
00:01:11.640 head
00:01:12.619 then
00:01:13.619 I

00:01:13.740 cut
00:01:14.159 it
00:01:14.189 out
00:01:14.430 in
00:01:14.880 a
00:01:15.060 as
00:01:15.810 thin
00:01:16.259 slices
00:01:16.799 as
00:01:17.009 I

00:01:17.720 absolutely
00:01:18.720 possibly
00:01:19.439 can
00:01:19.680 I
00:01:21.380 make
00:01:22.380 sure
00:01:22.619 to

00:01:22.680 follow
00:01:23.009 the
00:01:23.310 curvature
00:01:23.610 of
00:01:23.850 the
00:01:23.970 cabbage

00:01:31.860 then
00:01:32.860 I
00:01:33.010 end
00:01:33.490 up
00:01:33.580 with
00:01:33.760 a
00:01:33.820 ball
00:01:34.060 like
00:01:34.270 this
00:01:34.450 I

00:01:34.720 add
00:01:35.170 the
00:01:35.320 salt
00:01:37.230 then
00:01:38.230 I
00:01:38.320 have
00:01:38.500 to
00:01:38.650 break
00:01:39.520 down

00:01:39.760 of
00:01:40.120 the
00:01:40.420 cabbage
00:01:40.780 to
00:01:41.050 force
00:01:41.890 out
00:01:42.070 some
00:01:42.310 water

00:01:43.140 because
00:01:44.140 it
00:01:44.320 has
00:01:44.470 to
00:01:44.650 line
00:01:45.130 in
00:01:45.520 a
00:01:45.730 water
00:01:46.000 to
00:01:46.540 to

00:01:47.260 make
00:01:47.440 the
00:01:48.370 fermentation
00:01:48.730 take
00:01:49.240 place
00:01:49.480 and
00:01:49.870 see

00:01:50.380 now
00:01:50.500 it's
00:01:50.710 very
00:01:51.190 soft
00:01:51.550 and
00:01:51.730 very
00:01:51.970 wet
00:01:52.270 and
00:01:52.990 it's

00:01:53.170 that's
00:01:53.530 exactly
00:01:54.100 how
00:01:54.250 it
00:01:54.340 should
00:01:54.370 be
00:01:54.700 and
00:01:56.040 so
00:01:57.040 I

00:01:57.070 fill
00:01:57.430 up
00:01:57.460 the
00:01:57.580 fermentation
00:01:58.060 John
00:02:01.500 we
00:02:02.500 have
00:02:02.620 to

00:02:02.650 put
00:02:02.950 us
00:02:03.120 much
00:02:04.120 in
00:02:04.330 as
00:02:04.510 we
00:02:04.750 possibly
00:02:05.140 can
00:02:05.380 and

00:02:08.250 then
00:02:09.250 we
00:02:09.369 have
00:02:09.520 to
00:02:09.670 press
00:02:09.910 it
00:02:09.940 down
00:02:10.240 because

00:02:10.810 the
00:02:11.050 cabbage
00:02:11.500 has
00:02:11.650 to
00:02:11.830 be
00:02:11.920 covered
00:02:12.280 in
00:02:12.640 water

00:02:12.880 too
00:02:13.240 to
00:02:13.660 be
00:02:13.810 able
00:02:13.840 to
00:02:14.110 ferment
00:02:14.410 otherwise

00:02:14.950 it'll
00:02:15.460 simply
00:02:15.910 rot
00:02:17.160 we
00:02:18.160 press
00:02:18.400 it
00:02:18.520 down
00:02:18.670 hard

00:02:19.030 and
00:02:19.510 see
00:02:19.690 I
00:02:19.720 fill
00:02:20.080 up
00:02:20.230 the
00:02:20.380 jar
00:02:20.980 completely
00:02:21.610 and

00:02:21.790 now
00:02:22.570 it
00:02:22.690 takes
00:02:22.930 up
00:02:23.110 only
00:02:23.320 half
00:02:23.770 the
00:02:24.010 space
00:02:25.830 the

00:02:26.830 other
00:02:26.860 way
00:02:27.130 to
00:02:27.460 do
00:02:27.610 it
00:02:27.640 if
00:02:28.210 you
00:02:28.390 don't
00:02:28.480 want
00:02:28.690 to

00:02:28.780 cut
00:02:29.020 all
00:02:29.140 that
00:02:29.350 cabbage
00:02:29.680 by
00:02:30.010 hand

00:02:31.530 or
00:02:32.530 do
00:02:32.770 the
00:02:33.630 the
00:02:34.630 crossing
00:02:35.110 of
00:02:35.200 the
00:02:35.260 cabbage
00:02:36.570 is

00:02:37.570 to
00:02:37.780 use
00:02:37.930 a
00:02:37.959 machine
00:02:38.350 and
00:02:39.310 I
00:02:39.430 use
00:02:39.610 the
00:02:39.880 piccata

00:02:40.690 like
00:02:41.440 this

00:02:45.090 this
00:02:46.090 is
00:02:46.240 about
00:02:46.480 the
00:02:46.630 same
00:02:46.840 states
00:02:47.140 where

00:02:47.440 whether
00:02:47.980 it
00:02:48.540 was
00:02:49.540 with
00:02:49.750 the
00:02:49.840 knife
00:02:50.160 when
00:02:51.160 I
00:02:51.190 did

00:02:51.400 it
00:02:51.520 the
00:02:51.670 manual
00:02:51.880 way
00:02:52.410 but
00:02:53.410 instead
00:02:53.680 of

00:02:53.740 crossing
00:02:54.130 it
00:02:54.370 with
00:02:54.520 my
00:02:54.640 hands
00:02:55.000 I'll
00:02:55.150 make
00:02:55.360 a

00:02:56.340 finer
00:02:57.340 cabbage
00:02:57.790 if
00:02:58.060 I
00:02:58.240 cut
00:02:58.450 it
00:02:58.569 again
00:02:58.810 I
00:02:59.020 will

00:02:59.709 force
00:03:00.010 out
00:03:00.190 a
00:03:00.220 lot
00:03:00.459 of
00:03:00.580 liquid
00:03:01.239 so
00:03:03.180 the

00:03:04.180 fermentation
00:03:04.510 can
00:03:04.900 take
00:03:05.080 place
00:03:09.959 and
00:03:10.959 as
00:03:11.560 you

00:03:11.709 can
00:03:11.830 see
00:03:12.010 this
00:03:12.310 is
00:03:12.459 a
00:03:12.489 finer
00:03:12.940 structure
00:03:13.360 and

00:03:13.980 but
00:03:14.980 my
00:03:15.130 hands
00:03:15.430 are
00:03:15.519 already
00:03:16.060 weighed
00:03:16.510 by
00:03:16.959 this

00:03:17.200 so
00:03:17.440 this
00:03:18.040 is
00:03:18.190 fine
00:03:18.400 you
00:03:18.519 don't
00:03:18.640 have
00:03:18.760 to
00:03:18.880 cross

00:03:19.600 that
00:03:19.840 add
00:03:20.080 the
00:03:20.440 salt
00:03:20.680 and
00:03:21.239 then
00:03:22.239 mix
00:03:22.450 it
00:03:22.570 round

00:03:22.780 well
00:03:28.170 into
00:03:29.170 the
00:03:29.290 glass
00:03:29.500 with
00:03:29.739 that
00:03:29.890 to
00:03:30.160 the

00:03:30.940 fermentation
00:03:31.269 jar
00:03:31.920 and
00:03:32.920 this
00:03:33.160 is
00:03:33.280 just
00:03:33.519 a

00:03:33.670 plain
00:03:34.120 glass
00:03:34.390 jar
00:03:34.810 it
00:03:35.500 doesn't
00:03:35.800 have
00:03:35.920 to
00:03:36.069 be

00:03:36.220 anything
00:03:36.459 fancy
00:03:36.850 as
00:03:37.810 long
00:03:38.110 as
00:03:38.230 it
00:03:38.350 can
00:03:38.560 become

00:03:39.069 airtight
00:03:43.830 you
00:03:44.830 don't
00:03:45.040 want
00:03:45.280 any
00:03:45.519 air
00:03:45.760 down

00:03:46.150 down
00:03:46.630 in
00:03:46.989 it
00:03:47.560 with
