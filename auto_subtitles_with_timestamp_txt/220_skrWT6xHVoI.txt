00:00:06.899 demonstrate

00:00:07.109 oven-baked
00:00:07.980 hashbrowns

00:00:08.760 I
00:00:08.880 love
00:00:09.630 hashbrowns
00:00:10.380 but
00:00:10.800 unfortunately
00:00:11.460 the

00:00:11.700 oil
00:00:11.940 is
00:00:12.360 not
00:00:12.929 as
00:00:13.230 beneficial
00:00:13.830 as
00:00:14.009 if
00:00:14.460 we
00:00:14.580 could

00:00:14.759 get
00:00:14.880 the
00:00:15.000 oil
00:00:15.150 out
00:00:15.330 and
00:00:15.570 make
00:00:15.780 it
00:00:15.809 taste
00:00:16.139 just

00:00:16.320 as
00:00:16.470 good

00:00:53.460 I
00:00:53.489 like
00:00:53.910 McKay's
00:00:54.360 it
00:00:55.140 has
00:00:55.260 no
00:00:55.440 MSG
00:00:55.920 in
00:00:56.070 it
00:00:56.190 and

00:00:56.399 the
00:00:56.699 the
00:00:56.910 type
00:00:57.149 that
00:00:57.300 I
00:00:57.390 get
00:00:57.570 and
00:00:57.750 I'm
00:00:57.960 just

00:00:58.109 going
00:00:58.350 to
00:00:58.379 blend
00:00:58.739 those
00:01:00.620 until
00:01:01.620 smooth
00:01:01.980 and

00:01:02.219 with
00:01:02.370 a
00:01:02.399 high
00:01:02.609 speed
00:01:02.670 blender
00:01:03.090 it
00:01:03.539 only
00:01:03.719 takes

00:01:03.989 a
00:01:04.110 few
00:01:04.140 seconds

00:01:11.420 okay
00:01:12.420 that's
00:01:12.630 now
00:01:12.810 smooth
00:01:13.110 I'm
00:01:13.290 going
00:01:13.530 to
00:01:13.619 add

00:01:13.740 that
00:01:14.100 to
00:01:14.159 8
00:01:14.549 cups
00:01:15.090 of

00:01:17.040 get

00:01:17.640 frozen
00:01:18.210 hashbrowns
00:01:19.110 and
00:01:19.409 this
00:01:19.890 would
00:01:20.070 speed

00:01:20.400 up
00:01:20.430 the
00:01:20.610 process
00:01:21.540 of
00:01:21.690 making
00:01:21.900 it
00:01:23.180 you
00:01:24.180 will

00:01:24.299 need
00:01:24.450 2
00:01:24.720 pounds
00:01:25.220 which
00:01:26.220 is
00:01:26.399 equivalent
00:01:26.729 to
00:01:27.000 8

00:01:27.240 cups
00:01:27.690 you
00:01:28.440 just
00:01:28.710 want
00:01:28.890 to
00:01:28.979 mix
00:01:29.190 that
00:01:29.520 mixture

00:01:29.940 in
00:01:30.180 with
00:01:30.450 the
00:01:30.570 hashbrowns
00:01:31.009 we're
00:01:32.009 then
00:01:32.220 going

00:01:32.460 to
00:01:32.610 cover
00:01:32.880 it
00:01:33.090 with
00:01:33.210 a
00:01:33.240 cup
00:01:33.600 of
00:01:33.750 finely
00:01:34.080 diced

00:01:34.530 onions
00:01:35.390 put
00:01:36.390 it
00:01:36.479 on
00:01:36.659 our
00:01:36.840 cookie
00:01:37.229 sheet
00:01:37.259 and

00:01:37.710 then
00:01:38.460 put
00:01:38.729 it
00:01:38.820 in
00:01:38.909 the
00:01:39.030 oven
00:01:39.180 at
00:01:39.390 400
00:01:39.659 degrees

00:01:41.700 20
00:01:42.210 minutes
00:01:42.240 or
00:01:42.660 until
00:01:42.810 the
00:01:43.200 edges
00:01:43.350 are

00:01:43.770 getting
00:01:44.039 quite
00:01:44.310 brown
00:01:44.640 you
00:01:45.210 don't
00:01:45.390 want
00:01:45.570 to

00:01:45.660 leave
00:01:45.810 it
00:01:45.840 in
00:01:45.990 too
00:01:46.289 long

00:01:46.830 because
00:01:47.399 the
00:01:47.940 edges
00:01:48.330 will
00:01:48.539 start
00:01:48.810 burning
00:01:49.020 so

00:01:49.380 that's
00:01:50.280 pretty
00:01:50.610 well
00:01:50.759 mixed
00:01:51.119 up

00:01:54.060 diced
00:01:54.420 onions

00:01:54.960 going
00:01:55.950 to
00:01:56.039 mix
00:01:56.250 that
00:01:56.429 in
00:01:56.490 and

00:01:58.590 on

00:01:58.649 a
00:01:58.710 cookie
00:01:59.069 sheet
00:01:59.100 you
00:01:59.789 can
00:01:59.970 use
00:02:00.090 a
00:02:00.119 nonstick

00:02:00.690 cookie
00:02:01.050 sheet
00:02:01.229 I
00:02:01.319 put
00:02:01.560 a
00:02:01.590 very
00:02:01.890 slight
00:02:02.340 amount

00:02:02.700 of
00:02:02.789 olive

00:02:04.020 cookie
00:02:04.259 sheet
00:02:04.590 just

00:02:05.130 so
00:02:05.340 that
00:02:05.490 the
00:02:05.819 hashbrowns
00:02:06.360 won't
00:02:06.630 stick
00:02:06.929 to
00:02:07.110 it

00:02:07.140 and
00:02:07.380 then
00:02:07.830 we're
00:02:07.979 going
00:02:08.160 to
00:02:08.190 put

00:02:08.489 in
00:02:08.580 the

00:02:08.670 oven

00:02:12.330 cookie
00:02:12.450 sheet
00:02:17.690 you
00:02:18.690 want
00:02:18.780 to
00:02:18.900 spread
00:02:19.140 it

00:02:19.200 fairly
00:02:20.030 smooth
00:02:21.030 uniform
00:02:21.690 thickness

00:02:25.860 it
00:02:26.040 too
00:02:26.220 much
00:02:28.820 and
00:02:29.820 then

00:02:31.350 for
00:02:31.769 20
00:02:32.190 minutes
00:02:32.459 and
00:02:32.750 you

00:02:33.750 will
00:02:33.959 be
00:02:34.079 amazed
00:02:34.470 that
00:02:34.739 this
00:02:34.980 tastes
00:02:35.670 so
00:02:35.820 much

00:02:36.030 like
00:02:36.390 hashbrowns
