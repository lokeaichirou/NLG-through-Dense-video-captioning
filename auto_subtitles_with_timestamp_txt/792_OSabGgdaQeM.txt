00:00:17.970 just
00:00:18.119 fantastic
00:00:18.600 slow

00:00:21.810 stir

00:00:22.260 switch
00:00:22.470 it
00:00:22.619 on
00:00:22.710 and
00:00:23.039 walk
00:00:23.220 away
00:00:23.369 first
00:00:24.180 things

00:00:24.869 got
00:00:25.019 a
00:00:25.050 kilogram
00:00:25.590 of
00:00:25.800 beef
00:00:26.250 I'm

00:00:26.789 using

00:00:27.180 cheap
00:00:27.420 cut
00:00:27.630 of
00:00:27.660 beef
00:00:27.840 today
00:00:28.109 I'm

00:00:28.349 using
00:00:28.500 some
00:00:28.859 gravy
00:00:29.189 beef
00:00:29.550 and
00:00:29.880 we're
00:00:30.330 just

00:00:30.390 going
00:00:30.599 to
00:00:30.660 chuck
00:00:30.929 that
00:00:30.990 straight
00:00:31.710 in
00:00:32.239 in
00:00:33.239 about

00:00:33.570 sort
00:00:34.200 of
00:00:34.230 5
00:00:34.559 centimeters
00:00:35.100 or
00:00:35.250 about
00:00:35.280 2-inch

00:00:35.910 pieces
00:00:36.239 next
00:00:37.020 I'm
00:00:37.200 adding
00:00:37.320 in
00:00:37.530 two
00:00:37.770 small

00:00:38.190 brown
00:00:38.460 onions
00:00:38.940 which
00:00:39.149 I've
00:00:39.329 just
00:00:39.530 diced
00:00:40.530 up

00:00:40.829 one
00:00:41.309 clove
00:00:41.640 of
00:00:41.879 crushed
00:00:42.180 garlic
00:00:42.629 about

00:00:43.530 teaspoons
00:00:44.340 worth
00:00:44.579 and
00:00:44.879 two
00:00:45.539 red
00:00:45.899 capsicum

00:00:46.379 Zoar
00:00:46.739 red
00:00:46.950 bell
00:00:47.160 peppers
00:00:47.550 depending
00:00:47.879 on
00:00:47.969 where

00:00:48.120 you
00:00:48.210 live
00:00:48.360 in
00:00:48.480 the
00:00:48.570 world
00:00:48.690 which
00:00:49.289 again
00:00:49.829 I've

00:00:50.070 just
00:00:50.100 Dee
00:00:50.579 seeded
00:00:51.059 and
00:00:51.239 diced
00:00:51.660 up
00:00:52.260 give
00:00:52.800 that
00:00:52.980 a

00:00:53.010 quick
00:00:53.190 stir
00:00:53.280 around
00:00:55.340 you
00:00:56.340 can
00:00:56.610 Brown
00:00:57.000 the
00:00:57.300 beef

00:00:57.480 first
00:00:58.379 in
00:00:58.770 a
00:00:58.859 fry
00:00:59.070 pan
00:00:59.100 if
00:00:59.520 you
00:00:59.609 want
00:00:59.820 to
00:00:59.969 but
00:01:00.180 I

00:01:00.210 find
00:01:00.570 with
00:01:00.719 slow
00:01:00.930 cookers
00:01:01.289 like
00:01:01.469 this
00:01:01.620 it's

00:01:01.829 completely
00:01:02.460 unnecessary
00:01:02.760 because
00:01:03.329 you
00:01:03.570 don't

00:01:03.750 really
00:01:03.899 need
00:01:04.170 to
00:01:04.350 lock
00:01:04.530 in
00:01:04.650 the
00:01:04.680 juices

00:01:04.769 because
00:01:05.309 it's
00:01:05.970 being
00:01:06.180 cooked
00:01:06.450 on
00:01:06.720 a
00:01:06.930 low
00:01:07.530 heat

00:01:07.560 for
00:01:08.549 a
00:01:08.580 long
00:01:08.640 time
00:01:09.210 and
00:01:09.570 so
00:01:09.810 you
00:01:10.049 don't
00:01:10.500 end
00:01:10.710 up

00:01:10.860 getting
00:01:11.130 that
00:01:11.430 moisture
00:01:11.820 loss
00:01:12.000 that
00:01:12.180 you'll

00:01:12.270 get
00:01:12.450 if
00:01:12.630 you're
00:01:12.750 cooking
00:01:12.930 this
00:01:13.170 in
00:01:13.320 the
00:01:13.409 oven

00:01:13.680 or
00:01:13.830 over
00:01:14.040 the
00:01:14.130 stove
00:01:14.430 next
00:01:14.939 I'm
00:01:15.180 adding
00:01:15.450 in
00:01:15.540 a

00:01:15.720 400
00:01:16.320 gram
00:01:16.500 tin
00:01:16.830 of
00:01:17.100 diced
00:01:17.580 tomatoes
00:01:19.280 2

00:01:20.280 tablespoons
00:01:21.000 of
00:01:21.090 tomato
00:01:21.150 paste
00:01:21.450 or

00:01:21.960 concentrated
00:01:22.710 tomato
00:01:22.799 puree
00:01:23.369 2
00:01:24.150 tablespoons

00:01:24.869 of
00:01:25.140 sweet
00:01:25.710 paprika
00:01:25.950 now
00:01:26.610 this
00:01:27.210 is
00:01:27.390 sometimes

00:01:27.600 called
00:01:27.960 Hungarian
00:01:28.799 paprika
00:01:29.390 so
00:01:30.390 you'll
00:01:30.720 just

00:01:30.750 have
00:01:30.930 to
00:01:31.140 look
00:01:31.259 for
00:01:31.439 it
00:01:31.530 it'll
00:01:31.650 be
00:01:31.770 in
00:01:31.890 the

00:01:31.950 spice
00:01:32.250 aisle
00:01:32.520 in
00:01:33.210 your
00:01:33.420 supermarket
00:01:33.829 half
00:01:34.829 a

00:01:34.979 cup
00:01:35.189 of
00:01:35.340 beef
00:01:35.549 stock
00:01:35.909 and
00:01:37.579 half
00:01:38.579 a
00:01:38.700 cup
00:01:38.939 of

00:01:39.090 water
00:01:40.400 seasoned
00:01:41.400 with
00:01:41.490 a
00:01:41.520 little
00:01:41.579 salt
00:01:41.759 and

00:01:42.979 some
00:01:43.979 pepper
00:01:44.840 give
00:01:45.840 that
00:01:46.049 a
00:01:46.079 good
00:01:46.350 stir

00:01:46.799 together
00:01:47.060 and
00:01:49.070 that's
00:01:50.070 our
00:01:50.250 glass
00:01:50.579 ready
00:01:50.610 to

00:01:51.000 go
00:01:51.149 so
00:01:51.479 we
00:01:51.600 just
00:01:51.750 put
00:01:51.930 the
00:01:52.049 lid
00:01:52.200 on
00:01:52.229 and
00:01:52.530 we're

00:01:52.950 going

00:01:55.680 hours
00:01:55.920 on
00:01:56.189 high
00:01:56.460 but
00:01:56.790 I
00:01:56.880 highly

00:01:57.180 recommend
00:01:57.750 cooking
00:01:57.990 it
00:01:58.259 for
00:01:58.590 the
00:01:58.680 eight
00:01:58.860 hours

00:01:59.280 on
00:01:59.399 low
00:01:59.460 as
00:01:59.909 I
00:02:00.420 find
00:02:00.719 the
00:02:01.229 beef
00:02:01.439 becomes
00:02:01.770 a

00:02:02.219 more
00:02:02.250 tender
00:02:02.880 and
00:02:02.909 beautiful

00:02:04.500 slower
00:02:04.890 and
00:02:05.189 lower
00:02:05.880 cooking
00:02:06.360 time
00:02:06.630 but
00:02:06.960 feel

00:02:07.500 free
00:02:07.829 to
00:02:07.860 do
00:02:08.190 the
00:02:08.489 quick
00:02:08.670 version
00:02:08.849 if
00:02:09.239 you're

00:02:09.360 short

00:02:17.760 is
00:02:18.030 thickened
00:02:18.510 up
00:02:18.690 and
00:02:18.900 that
00:02:19.770 meat

00:02:20.100 is

00:02:28.260 entirely
00:02:28.650 optional
00:02:28.950 but
00:02:29.850 I
00:02:30.090 like
00:02:30.300 to
00:02:30.450 add

00:02:49.350 of
00:02:49.440 course
00:02:49.650 you
