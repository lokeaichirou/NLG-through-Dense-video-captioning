00:02:22.640 love
00:02:22.910 garlic
00:02:23.090 I
00:02:23.480 had
00:02:23.780 to

00:02:23.870 buy
00:02:23.990 ginger
00:02:24.470 that
00:02:24.920 I
00:02:24.950 cut
00:02:25.400 up
00:02:25.430 myself
00:02:25.760 you
00:02:26.690 know

00:02:26.720 things
00:02:27.170 that
00:02:27.260 are
00:02:27.410 different
00:02:27.560 in
00:02:27.800 Korea
00:02:28.100 one

00:02:28.430 thing
00:02:28.640 you
00:02:28.790 really
00:02:29.090 don't
00:02:29.420 want
00:02:29.630 is
00:02:29.810 burnt

00:02:30.140 garlic
00:02:30.380 so
00:02:30.920 after
00:02:31.730 you
00:02:31.820 add
00:02:31.970 the
00:02:32.090 garlic
00:02:32.210 don't

00:02:32.840 wait
00:02:33.020 very
00:02:33.230 long
00:02:33.290 before
00:02:33.680 you
00:02:33.740 start
00:02:33.920 adding

00:02:34.010 other
00:02:34.190 ingredients
00:02:34.360 next
00:02:35.360 up
00:02:35.510 is
00:02:35.690 the
00:02:36.230 pork

00:02:36.650 and
00:02:36.890 I've
00:02:37.760 also
00:02:38.060 when
00:02:38.930 I
00:02:38.960 cook
00:02:39.680 this
00:02:39.800 earlier
00:02:40.190 I

00:02:40.250 put
00:02:40.610 the
00:02:40.820 ginger
00:02:41.180 in
00:02:41.480 with
00:02:41.660 it
00:02:41.840 so
00:02:42.350 it
00:02:42.560 would

00:02:43.150 just
00:02:44.150 so
00:02:44.570 the
00:02:44.690 flavors
00:02:45.050 would
00:02:45.140 combine
00:02:45.350 a

00:02:45.470 little
00:02:45.740 bit
00:02:45.830 I
00:02:45.860 think
00:02:45.980 it
00:02:46.190 would
00:02:46.280 be
00:02:46.310 really

00:02:46.490 good
00:02:46.670 so
00:02:46.880 there's
00:02:47.060 been
00:02:47.180 to
00:02:47.300 set
00:02:47.480 airtight
00:02:47.870 for

00:02:48.050 a
00:02:48.080 while
00:02:48.170 so
00:02:48.320 all
00:02:48.470 that
00:02:48.680 air
00:02:49.330 all
00:02:50.330 the
00:02:50.390 flavors

00:02:50.750 from
00:02:50.810 the
00:02:50.959 ginger
00:02:51.290 were
00:02:51.470 able
00:02:51.770 to
00:02:51.950 mix
00:02:52.820 in
00:02:53.090 with

00:02:53.360 the
00:02:53.510 pork
00:02:53.750 so
00:02:53.930 I'm
00:02:54.050 actually
00:02:54.410 really
00:02:54.650 excited

00:02:54.770 about
00:02:55.100 this
00:02:55.190 so
00:02:55.520 we're
00:02:55.610 gonna
00:02:55.700 go

00:03:04.670 really

00:03:04.790 well
00:03:04.910 I
00:03:05.090 did
00:03:05.240 much
00:03:05.390 better
