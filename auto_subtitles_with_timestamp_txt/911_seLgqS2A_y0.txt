00:00:01.460 if
00:00:02.460 you're
00:00:02.730 cooking
00:00:02.850 a
00:00:03.090 burger
00:00:03.270 and
00:00:03.689 you're

00:00:04.170 actually
00:00:04.290 using
00:00:04.859 a
00:00:04.950 frozen
00:00:05.460 patty
00:00:05.790 like
00:00:06.060 that

00:00:06.270 and
00:00:06.770 on
00:00:07.770 top
00:00:08.099 of
00:00:08.130 it
00:00:08.370 you're
00:00:08.670 using
00:00:08.880 some

00:00:09.300 prepackaged
00:00:09.840 buns
00:00:10.670 you're
00:00:11.670 doing
00:00:11.910 it
00:00:12.000 all

00:00:13.730 if
00:00:14.730 you
00:00:14.880 think
00:00:15.150 you
00:00:15.420 make
00:00:15.570 it
00:00:15.660 easy
00:00:15.809 on

00:00:16.020 yourself
00:00:16.109 and
00:00:16.529 actually
00:00:16.710 using
00:00:17.400 a
00:00:17.490 frozen

00:00:17.970 burger
00:00:18.359 at
00:00:18.510 home
00:00:18.720 especially
00:00:18.990 if
00:00:19.289 you're

00:00:19.439 coming
00:00:19.590 home
00:00:19.770 after
00:00:19.980 busy
00:00:20.369 day
00:00:20.550 I
00:00:20.789 think
00:00:21.240 it's

00:00:21.359 so
00:00:21.750 wrong

00:00:22.140 I
00:00:22.170 even
00:00:22.320 have
00:00:22.529 a
00:00:22.560 hard
00:00:22.769 time
00:00:22.890 touching
00:00:23.189 it
00:00:23.519 not

00:00:23.699 even
00:00:23.880 thing
00:00:24.210 out
00:00:24.359 cooking
00:00:24.630 it
00:00:24.869 that
00:00:25.170 freezin

00:00:25.619 burn
00:00:25.800 that
00:00:26.039 completely
00:00:26.519 dry
00:00:26.849 they're

00:00:27.300 probably
00:00:27.510 grinding
00:00:27.960 that
00:00:28.050 two
00:00:28.230 years
00:00:28.439 ago
00:00:28.680 and

00:00:28.920 that's
00:00:29.250 what
00:00:29.400 you're
00:00:29.490 ending
00:00:29.640 up
00:00:29.849 in
00:00:30.000 your

00:00:30.240 house
00:00:30.390 so
00:00:30.810 of
00:00:30.900 course
00:00:31.050 now
00:00:31.320 if
00:00:31.560 you're
00:00:31.710 not

00:00:32.009 going
00:00:32.279 for
00:00:32.430 the
00:00:32.520 frozen
00:00:32.880 one
00:00:33.059 you're
00:00:33.450 thinking

00:00:33.480 probably
00:00:34.140 doing
00:00:34.320 the
00:00:34.410 right
00:00:34.680 thing
00:00:34.950 and

00:00:35.219 actually
00:00:35.550 buying
00:00:35.790 some
00:00:36.120 fresh
00:00:36.450 ground
00:00:36.750 meat

00:00:37.110 for
00:00:37.500 example
00:00:37.829 the
00:00:37.920 one
00:00:38.160 that
00:00:38.340 I
00:00:38.370 have
00:00:38.520 right

00:00:38.550 here
00:00:39.120 it's
00:00:39.270 nice
00:00:39.870 bright
00:00:40.320 red
00:00:40.530 very
00:00:41.129 fresh
00:00:41.460 but

00:00:41.730 it's
00:00:42.390 extra
00:00:43.050 lean
00:00:43.230 there's
00:00:43.530 no
00:00:43.739 fat
00:00:44.070 in
00:00:44.100 it
00:00:44.340 no

00:00:44.640 fat
00:00:44.879 no
00:00:45.120 flavor
00:00:45.690 it's
00:00:46.020 a
00:00:46.230 boring
00:00:46.469 burger
00:00:46.860 never

00:00:47.700 seasoned
00:00:48.120 the
00:00:48.210 meat
00:00:48.239 ahead
00:00:48.660 of
00:00:48.780 time
00:00:49.020 because

00:00:49.320 what
00:00:49.739 the
00:00:49.860 salt
00:00:50.160 actually
00:00:50.370 does
00:00:50.670 to
00:00:50.820 the

00:00:50.940 burger
00:00:51.270 it
00:00:51.570 starts
00:00:52.079 on
00:00:52.170 curing
00:00:52.649 the
00:00:52.739 meat
00:00:52.920 the

00:00:53.370 texture
00:00:53.760 is
00:00:53.820 not
00:00:53.969 the
00:00:54.090 same
00:00:54.329 you
00:00:54.690 are
00:00:54.809 ruining

00:00:55.230 your
00:00:55.590 burger

00:00:55.980 another
00:00:56.460 big
00:00:56.730 mistake
00:00:56.879 do
00:00:57.600 not
00:00:57.629 overheat
00:00:58.199 and

00:00:58.829 heat
00:00:59.100 the
00:00:59.219 skillet
00:00:59.609 if
00:00:59.879 you
00:01:00.180 end
00:01:00.390 up
00:01:00.539 eat
00:01:00.690 the

00:01:00.870 pan
00:01:01.079 and
00:01:01.350 you
00:01:01.469 put
00:01:01.649 actually
00:01:01.920 the
00:01:02.010 burger
00:01:02.340 into

00:01:02.640 the
00:01:02.910 oil
00:01:03.120 it
00:01:03.570 will
00:01:03.840 not
00:01:04.019 C
00:01:04.409 R
00:01:04.439 therefore
00:01:04.949 the

00:01:05.250 burger
00:01:05.580 doesn't
00:01:05.760 seal
00:01:06.210 and
00:01:06.479 you
00:01:06.600 will
00:01:06.750 lose

00:01:06.869 the
00:01:06.900 juices
00:01:07.439 from
00:01:07.560 the
00:01:07.650 burger
00:01:08.010 if
00:01:08.189 you

00:01:08.610 overheat
00:01:09.060 the
00:01:09.390 pan
00:01:09.600 and
00:01:09.869 you
00:01:09.990 put
00:01:10.170 the
00:01:10.260 burger

00:01:10.470 down
00:01:10.740 that
00:01:11.100 burger
00:01:11.460 will
00:01:11.610 never
00:01:11.939 cook
00:01:12.180 not

00:01:12.390 even
00:01:12.659 to
00:01:12.810 the
00:01:12.930 medium
00:01:13.290 rare
00:01:13.439 or
00:01:13.470 medium
00:01:13.920 side

00:01:14.130 the
00:01:14.729 outside
00:01:15.240 will
00:01:15.479 be
00:01:15.509 already
00:01:16.110 burnt
00:01:16.939 never

00:01:17.939 toss
00:01:18.180 the
00:01:18.330 bun
00:01:18.479 too
00:01:18.720 early
00:01:19.049 because
00:01:19.200 they
00:01:19.500 only

00:01:19.680 get
00:01:19.890 stale
00:01:20.310 and
00:01:20.640 rubbery
00:01:21.030 and
00:01:21.330 the
00:01:21.659 finally

00:01:22.140 steak
00:01:22.380 that
00:01:22.560 I
00:01:22.619 see

00:01:24.270 this
00:01:24.509 burgers
00:01:24.900 and
00:01:25.170 then
00:01:25.350 really
00:01:25.920 pushing
00:01:26.490 it

00:01:26.580 down
00:01:26.759 on
00:01:26.970 the
00:01:27.060 grill
00:01:27.270 and
00:01:27.509 what
00:01:27.960 you're

00:01:28.080 actually
00:01:28.200 doing
00:01:28.439 there
00:01:28.979 is
00:01:29.189 squeezing
00:01:29.790 out

00:01:30.060 all
00:01:30.390 the
00:01:30.600 juices
00:01:30.990 from
00:01:31.110 the
00:01:31.320 burger
00:01:31.619 the

00:01:31.979 result
00:01:32.400 you're
00:01:32.790 ending
00:01:33.000 up
00:01:33.240 with
00:01:33.479 a
00:01:33.540 thin

00:01:34.049 patty
00:01:34.320 very
00:01:35.040 dry
00:01:35.280 on
00:01:35.579 a
00:01:35.640 soggy
00:01:36.090 bun
00:01:36.360 that's
00:01:36.900 so

00:01:37.320 wrong
00:01:39.049 now
00:01:40.049 I'm
00:01:40.530 going
00:01:40.680 to
00:01:40.740 show
00:01:40.920 you
00:01:40.950 the

00:01:41.159 right
00:01:41.400 way
00:01:41.460 how
00:01:41.880 to
00:01:41.939 do
00:01:42.180 the
00:01:42.329 best
00:01:42.689 burger

00:01:43.079 first
00:01:43.680 of
00:01:43.829 all
00:01:43.950 you
00:01:44.340 have
00:01:44.460 to
00:01:44.610 pick
00:01:44.820 the

00:01:44.970 freshest
00:01:45.570 meat
00:01:45.750 fat
00:01:46.439 in
00:01:46.619 a
00:01:46.710 burger
00:01:46.979 is
00:01:47.130 so

00:01:47.399 important
00:01:47.880 because
00:01:48.030 not
00:01:48.360 only
00:01:48.479 it
00:01:48.810 adds

00:01:48.990 flavor
00:01:49.500 to
00:01:49.619 the
00:01:49.860 burger
00:01:50.159 but
00:01:50.520 also
00:01:50.700 it
00:01:51.090 adds

00:01:51.299 that
00:01:51.509 moistness
00:01:51.990 look
00:01:52.649 for
00:01:52.860 some
00:01:53.100 coarsely

00:01:53.759 grind
00:01:54.090 meat
00:01:54.450 or
00:01:54.960 buy
00:01:55.829 a
00:01:55.860 piece
00:01:56.130 of
00:01:56.159 meat
00:01:56.520 and
00:01:56.729 go

00:01:57.210 to
00:01:57.270 the
00:01:57.479 extra
00:01:57.899 work
00:01:58.049 actually
00:01:58.350 we
00:01:58.920 slice
00:01:59.280 it

00:01:59.310 by
00:01:59.549 hand
00:02:01.250 always
00:02:02.250 think
00:02:02.670 about
00:02:02.880 using
00:02:03.060 a
00:02:03.270 nice

00:02:03.479 piece
00:02:03.750 of
00:02:03.780 chuck
00:02:04.259 or
00:02:04.500 maybe
00:02:04.920 some
00:02:05.310 strip
00:02:05.820 steak

00:02:06.090 and
00:02:06.329 then
00:02:06.450 of
00:02:06.600 course
00:02:06.840 the
00:02:06.990 ultimate
00:02:07.170 would
00:02:07.740 be

00:02:07.890 then
00:02:08.069 the
00:02:08.459 Kobe
00:02:08.940 beef
00:02:08.970 where
00:02:09.660 really
00:02:09.869 is
00:02:10.140 the

00:02:10.379 highest
00:02:10.830 in
00:02:11.009 fat
00:02:11.250 content
00:02:11.760 and
00:02:11.849 as
00:02:12.360 you
00:02:12.540 make

00:02:12.720 your
00:02:12.750 patty

00:02:13.709 the
00:02:13.829 adventures
00:02:14.340 really
00:02:15.000 think
00:02:15.359 a
00:02:15.450 little
00:02:15.510 bit

00:02:15.719 out
00:02:15.840 of
00:02:15.870 the
00:02:16.019 box
00:02:16.260 mixing
00:02:17.069 some
00:02:17.370 ingredients

00:02:18.000 into
00:02:18.180 that
00:02:18.659 brown
00:02:18.930 meat
00:02:19.230 for
00:02:19.709 example
00:02:19.769 some

00:02:20.340 soaked
00:02:20.849 mustard
00:02:21.359 seeds
00:02:21.629 some
00:02:22.260 fresh
00:02:22.530 herbs

00:02:22.799 some
00:02:23.400 sauteed
00:02:23.819 and
00:02:23.939 mushrooms
00:02:24.590 when
00:02:25.590 you're

00:02:25.769 shaping
00:02:26.189 the
00:02:26.459 burger
00:02:26.760 always
00:02:27.480 use
00:02:27.719 a
00:02:27.750 little

00:02:27.900 bit
00:02:28.290 of
00:02:28.530 water
00:02:29.040 on
00:02:29.189 your
00:02:29.579 hand
00:02:29.819 so
00:02:30.329 first
00:02:30.569 of

00:02:30.689 all
00:02:30.780 the
00:02:30.989 burger
00:02:31.319 and
00:02:31.469 the
00:02:31.650 meat
00:02:31.889 doesn't

00:02:32.040 stick
00:02:32.459 on
00:02:32.609 your
00:02:32.849 fingers
00:02:33.209 and
00:02:33.359 you
00:02:33.750 perfectly

00:02:34.319 can
00:02:34.530 shape
00:02:34.829 that

00:02:39.299 going
00:02:39.450 to
00:02:39.510 work

00:02:43.200 short
00:02:43.590 ribs
00:02:43.769 for

00:02:43.889 example
00:02:44.400 I
00:02:44.519 put
00:02:45.000 the
00:02:45.090 short
00:02:45.359 ribs
00:02:45.540 in
00:02:45.720 the

00:02:45.810 center
00:02:46.200 of
00:02:46.230 the
00:02:46.379 burger
00:02:47.000 that
00:02:48.000 brings
00:02:48.269 like

00:02:48.480 the
00:02:48.599 burger
00:02:48.840 two
00:02:49.079 to
00:02:49.290 four
00:02:49.500 different
00:02:49.650 another

00:02:49.950 level
00:02:52.459 don't
00:02:53.459 even
00:02:53.669 think
00:02:54.239 on
00:02:54.359 using
00:02:54.659 olive

00:02:54.989 oil
00:02:55.109 use
00:02:55.620 some
00:02:55.799 canola
00:02:56.129 oil
00:02:56.220 oil
00:02:56.730 who
00:02:56.879 really

00:02:57.150 supports
00:02:57.599 nicely
00:02:57.989 that
00:02:58.139 lead
00:02:58.319 and
00:02:58.500 how
00:02:59.069 do
00:02:59.129 you

00:02:59.250 know
00:02:59.430 that
00:02:59.639 actually
00:02:59.819 your
00:03:00.120 pan
00:03:00.389 is
00:03:00.629 really
00:03:01.019 to

00:03:01.169 the
00:03:01.290 right
00:03:01.439 temperature
00:03:01.769 is
00:03:02.250 when
00:03:02.730 the
00:03:02.849 oil

00:03:02.879 smokes
00:03:03.599 slightly
00:03:04.079 so
00:03:04.829 searing
00:03:05.370 the
00:03:05.459 burner
00:03:05.669 is

00:03:05.969 probably
00:03:06.419 the
00:03:06.540 most
00:03:06.780 important
00:03:07.409 step
00:03:07.620 you
00:03:08.010 put

00:03:08.400 the
00:03:08.519 burger
00:03:08.819 in
00:03:09.000 the
00:03:09.030 oil
00:03:09.359 Sirian
00:03:10.290 means
00:03:10.530 you

00:03:10.799 seal
00:03:11.250 it
00:03:11.400 and
00:03:11.430 by
00:03:11.730 sealing
00:03:12.120 it
00:03:12.359 means
00:03:12.540 all
00:03:12.840 the

00:03:13.230 juices
00:03:13.620 are
00:03:13.799 staying
00:03:14.280 inside
00:03:14.579 think
00:03:15.389 about

00:03:15.629 cooking
00:03:16.049 it
00:03:16.169 like
00:03:16.590 a
00:03:16.650 steak
00:03:17.780 before
00:03:18.780 serving

00:03:19.530 it
00:03:19.620 let
00:03:20.099 it
00:03:20.129 rest
00:03:20.400 a
00:03:20.579 little
00:03:20.819 bit
00:03:20.970 so
00:03:21.299 that
00:03:21.329 the

00:03:21.599 juices
00:03:22.049 inside
00:03:22.319 the
00:03:23.040 steak
00:03:23.340 or
00:03:23.579 the
00:03:23.639 burger

00:03:24.329 are
00:03:24.540 distributed
00:03:25.379 evenly
00:03:25.669 now
00:03:26.669 comes
00:03:26.909 the
00:03:27.090 fun

00:03:27.329 part
00:03:27.629 actually
00:03:27.930 assembling
00:03:28.620 a
00:03:28.769 burger
00:03:28.979 so

00:03:29.250 you're
00:03:29.609 standing
00:03:29.790 with
00:03:30.090 a
00:03:30.150 bun
00:03:30.449 always
00:03:31.109 toss

00:03:31.409 the
00:03:31.590 bun
00:03:31.769 or
00:03:31.979 the
00:03:32.099 last
00:03:32.430 moment
00:03:32.879 that's
00:03:33.359 how

00:03:33.569 you
00:03:33.629 get
00:03:33.840 really
00:03:34.199 the
00:03:34.319 bread
00:03:34.739 showing
00:03:35.189 at
00:03:35.340 its

00:03:35.549 best
00:03:35.760 and
00:03:36.090 what
00:03:36.540 I
00:03:36.569 like
00:03:37.109 really
00:03:37.470 is
00:03:37.739 picking
00:03:38.250 a

00:03:38.370 bun
00:03:38.579 like
00:03:38.609 ciabatta
00:03:39.299 for
00:03:39.599 example

00:03:40.560 nice
00:03:41.010 golden
00:03:41.609 crust
00:03:41.849 on
00:03:42.269 top
00:03:42.299 of
00:03:42.659 it
00:03:42.750 think

00:03:43.229 about
00:03:43.470 using
00:03:43.680 a
00:03:43.889 little
00:03:43.979 pesto
00:03:44.400 you
00:03:44.819 can
00:03:45.180 use

00:03:45.329 the
00:03:45.509 freshest
00:03:45.989 tomatoes
00:03:46.379 of

00:03:47.159 you're
00:03:47.340 really
00:03:47.579 layering
00:03:48.030 it
00:03:48.120 up
00:03:48.269 you
00:03:48.449 can

00:03:48.599 push
00:03:48.840 it
00:03:48.989 to
00:03:49.019 using
00:03:49.590 a
00:03:49.739 little
00:03:49.889 bit
00:03:49.979 of
00:03:50.069 sheer

00:03:50.430 pineapple
00:03:51.030 you
00:03:51.389 can
00:03:51.419 use
00:03:51.689 the
00:03:51.810 caramelized

00:03:52.829 so
00:03:53.189 really
00:03:53.519 the
00:03:54.030 layers
00:03:54.359 are
00:03:54.720 endless
00:03:55.310 if
00:03:56.310 you

00:03:56.849 do
00:03:56.970 all
