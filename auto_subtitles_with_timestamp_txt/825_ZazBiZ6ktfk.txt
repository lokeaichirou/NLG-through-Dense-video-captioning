00:03:08.750 it

00:03:08.870 pretty
00:03:08.900 much
00:03:09.170 anywhere
00:03:09.260 in
00:03:09.770 Japan
00:03:09.920 but
00:03:10.700 for

00:03:10.940 those
00:03:11.030 we
00:03:11.300 cannot

00:03:11.930 wipeout
00:03:12.290 I'll
00:03:12.709 show

00:03:12.920 you
00:03:12.980 the
00:03:13.100 alternative
00:03:13.220 ingredients
00:03:14.890 this
00:03:15.890 is

00:03:16.070 a
00:03:16.100 chicken
00:03:16.459 powder
00:03:16.640 from
00:03:17.470 actually
00:03:18.470 I
00:03:18.500 don't

00:03:18.620 know
00:03:18.770 how
00:03:19.160 to
00:03:19.220 process
00:03:19.610 something
00:03:20.540 like
00:03:20.840 blue

00:03:21.200 cranky
00:03:21.700 anyway
00:03:22.700 it
00:03:23.030 tastes
00:03:23.450 a
00:03:23.480 little

00:03:23.510 different
00:03:24.080 but
00:03:24.470 some
00:03:24.890 are
00:03:25.040 close
00:03:25.310 and
00:03:25.550 a
00:03:25.880 lot

00:03:26.060 of
00:03:26.180 Japanese
00:03:26.390 people
00:03:26.660 in
00:03:26.959 America
00:03:27.320 use
00:03:27.470 this

00:03:27.650 for
00:03:27.950 weight
00:03:28.280 but
00:03:28.490 instead
00:03:28.850 I'm
00:03:29.780 not
00:03:29.990 sure
00:03:30.320 if

00:03:30.470 this
00:03:30.620 is
00:03:30.680 exactly
00:03:31.280 the
00:03:31.490 same
00:03:31.730 but
00:03:32.209 I
00:03:32.420 think
00:03:32.690 is

00:03:32.810 almost
00:03:33.080 the
00:03:33.410 same
00:03:33.650 since
00:03:34.010 it's
00:03:34.160 from
00:03:34.370 the
00:03:34.520 same

00:03:34.670 company
00:03:34.940 Walmart
00:03:35.870 or
00:03:36.020 other
00:03:36.440 supermarkets

00:03:37.130 might
00:03:37.280 have
00:03:37.489 one
00:03:37.640 so
00:03:38.239 maybe
00:03:38.510 you
00:03:38.720 don't
00:03:38.810 even

00:03:38.930 have
00:03:39.230 to
00:03:39.410 go
00:03:39.530 to
00:03:39.590 an
00:03:39.769 Asian
00:03:39.830 supermarket
