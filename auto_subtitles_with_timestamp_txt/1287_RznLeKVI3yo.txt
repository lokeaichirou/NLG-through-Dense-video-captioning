00:00:26.510 the

00:00:26.570 first
00:00:26.869 thing
00:00:27.050 I
00:00:27.140 did
00:00:27.200 was
00:00:27.770 set
00:00:28.039 up
00:00:28.070 a
00:00:28.280 rimmed

00:00:28.610 baking
00:00:28.760 sheet
00:00:29.180 by

00:00:36.500 the
00:00:36.620 wire
00:00:36.860 rack

00:00:37.310 allows
00:00:37.790 the
