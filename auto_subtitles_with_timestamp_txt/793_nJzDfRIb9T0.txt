00:00:39.600 is
00:00:39.960 so
00:00:40.140 delicious
00:00:40.680 it's
00:00:41.040 also
00:00:41.219 why
00:00:41.460 it

00:00:41.520 takes
00:00:41.670 a
00:00:41.760 couple

00:00:45.420 cut
00:00:45.629 your
00:00:45.660 own
00:00:45.840 is

00:00:46.200 because
00:00:46.469 when
00:00:46.620 you
00:00:46.710 buy
00:00:46.800 pre-cut

00:00:48.270 are
00:00:48.450 the
00:00:48.510 pieces
00:00:48.690 they

00:00:48.960 literally
00:00:49.379 can't
00:00:49.800 sell
00:00:50.070 any

00:02:04.890 pan

00:02:05.070 aside
00:02:05.159 while
00:02:05.520 you
00:02:05.549 prep
00:02:05.880 your
00:02:06.030 spices
00:02:06.270 one
00:02:07.200 of

00:02:07.290 the
00:02:07.350 signature
00:02:07.799 spices
00:02:08.039 in
00:02:08.369 goulash
00:02:08.789 is

00:02:09.060 caraway
00:02:09.629 and
00:02:09.959 there
00:02:10.259 they
00:02:10.410 are
00:02:10.440 little

00:02:10.950 caraway
00:02:11.310 seeds
00:02:11.640 I'm
00:02:12.270 going
00:02:12.420 to
00:02:12.480 throw
00:02:12.569 a

00:02:12.629 couple
00:02:12.870 teaspoons
00:02:13.020 in
00:02:13.379 a
00:02:13.440 mortar

00:02:13.830 hustle
00:02:14.160 and
00:02:14.310 crush
00:02:14.520 it
00:02:14.670 up
00:02:14.790 you
00:02:15.180 could
00:02:15.300 use
00:02:15.420 a

00:02:15.450 spice
00:02:15.720 grinder
00:02:15.900 but
00:02:16.380 it
00:02:16.470 was
00:02:16.560 just
00:02:16.650 a
00:02:16.770 little

00:02:16.980 bit
00:02:17.130 so
00:02:17.280 that's
00:02:17.370 an
00:02:17.520 easy
00:02:17.640 way
00:02:17.820 to
00:02:17.850 do
00:02:18.090 it
00:02:18.120 I'm

00:02:18.570 gonna
00:02:18.810 dump
00:02:19.020 my
00:02:19.170 ground
00:02:19.440 caraway
00:02:19.890 seeds
00:02:20.220 into

00:02:20.520 our
00:02:20.640 dry
00:02:20.880 but
00:02:21.120 still
00:02:21.330 dirty
00:02:21.540 pan
00:02:21.840 along
00:02:22.740 with

00:02:22.800 some
00:02:22.950 paprika

00:02:23.700 hopefully
00:02:24.090 it's
00:02:24.180 Hungarian
00:02:24.660 but
00:02:24.840 if
00:02:24.900 you
00:02:24.990 have

00:02:25.080 to
00:02:25.200 use
00:02:25.290 Spanish
00:02:25.680 paprika
00:02:25.860 no
00:02:26.670 problemo

00:02:27.420 I'm
00:02:27.660 also
00:02:27.810 going
00:02:27.960 to
00:02:28.050 toss
00:02:28.200 in
00:02:28.380 some
00:02:28.410 black

00:02:28.740 pepper
00:02:29.030 some
00:02:30.030 dry
00:02:30.300 marjoram
00:02:30.920 some
00:02:31.920 dry
00:02:32.160 thyme

00:02:32.550 and
00:02:33.090 some
00:02:33.720 cayenne
00:02:34.110 I'm
00:02:34.830 gonna
00:02:34.980 put
00:02:35.160 the
00:02:35.250 heat

00:02:35.460 on
00:02:35.490 medium
00:02:36.120 and
00:02:36.420 I'm
00:02:36.690 going
00:02:36.810 to
00:02:36.840 toast
00:02:37.080 those

00:02:37.320 spices
00:02:37.620 in
00:02:37.950 the
00:02:38.040 dry
00:02:38.280 pan
00:02:38.550 for
00:02:38.820 about
00:02:38.990 three
00:02:39.990 or

00:02:40.080 four
00:02:40.260 minutes
00:02:40.440 but
00:02:41.100 don't
00:02:41.280 necessarily
00:02:41.370 go
00:02:41.850 by

00:02:42.000 time
00:02:42.330 you
00:02:42.900 want
00:02:43.020 to
00:02:43.110 keep
00:02:43.230 stirring
00:02:43.440 moving
00:02:44.010 it

00:02:44.130 around
00:02:44.340 the
00:02:44.460 pan
00:02:44.670 until
00:02:45.000 you
00:02:45.120 can
00:02:45.270 just
00:02:45.570 sort

00:02:45.690 of
00:02:45.870 barely
00:02:46.230 smell
00:02:46.770 that
00:02:46.950 caraway
00:02:47.430 seed

00:02:47.730 toasting
00:02:48.240 we
00:02:48.660 certainly
00:02:48.960 don't
00:02:49.080 want
00:02:49.170 to
00:02:49.320 burn

00:02:49.500 these
00:02:49.710 spices
00:02:49.950 but
00:02:50.460 we
00:02:50.580 do
00:02:50.700 want
00:02:50.880 to
00:02:50.910 wake
00:02:51.090 them

00:02:51.210 up
00:02:51.330 with
00:02:51.510 that
00:02:51.630 heat
00:02:51.900 it
00:02:52.290 really
00:02:52.470 does
00:02:52.620 make
00:02:52.770 a

00:02:52.830 difference
00:02:52.920 so
00:02:53.490 after
00:02:53.910 three
00:02:54.120 or
00:02:54.150 four

00:02:54.270 minutes
00:02:54.630 at
00:02:54.720 osteen

00:03:07.740 going

00:03:14.850 I
00:03:15.150 dipped
00:03:15.390 into

00:03:16.020 paste
00:03:16.170 first
00:03:16.470 sometimes
00:03:17.220 I
00:03:17.459 do
00:03:17.520 things
00:03:17.850 for
00:03:17.910 no

00:03:18.090 reason
00:03:18.390 a
00:03:18.510 little
00:03:19.140 bit
00:03:19.260 of
00:03:19.350 salt
00:03:19.560 and

00:03:21.540 chicken
00:03:21.900 broth
00:03:22.050 a
00:03:22.530 little
00:03:23.130 bit
00:03:23.640 of
00:03:23.730 sugar
00:03:23.970 like

00:03:24.239 a
00:03:24.780 teaspoon
00:03:25.230 just
00:03:25.440 to
00:03:25.739 balance
00:03:26.040 the
00:03:26.130 acidity

00:03:26.220 from
00:03:26.670 the
00:03:26.850 tomato
00:03:27.150 paste
00:03:27.390 in
00:03:27.720 this
00:03:27.840 next

00:03:28.080 ingredient
00:03:28.260 which
00:03:28.680 is
00:03:28.800 a
00:03:28.830 little
00:03:29.100 bit
00:03:29.190 of

00:03:29.280 balsamic
00:03:29.459 vinegar
00:03:29.989 all
00:03:30.989 right
00:03:31.080 we're
00:03:31.230 going

00:03:31.350 to
00:03:31.380 give
00:03:31.530 that
00:03:31.560 a
00:03:31.739 stir

00:03:32.070 I'm
00:03:32.700 not
00:03:32.910 sure
00:03:33.000 why
00:03:33.150 I'm
00:03:33.269 using
00:03:33.390 the

00:03:33.570 freakishly
00:03:33.930 small
00:03:34.230 wooden
00:03:34.500 spoon
00:03:34.739 if
00:03:35.040 that

00:03:35.250 thing
00:03:35.459 snapped
00:03:35.790 I
00:03:36.090 would
00:03:36.269 have
00:03:36.390 to
00:03:36.480 quit

00:03:36.630 YouTube
00:03:36.989 alright
00:03:37.560 so
00:03:37.709 I
00:03:37.739 should
00:03:37.920 be
00:03:37.950 using
00:03:38.130 a

00:03:38.220 bigger
00:03:38.400 spoon
00:03:38.640 but
00:03:38.970 that's
00:03:39.090 okay
00:03:39.360 sometimes

00:03:40.050 you
00:03:40.170 got
00:03:40.290 to
00:03:40.320 live
00:03:40.530 dangerously
00:03:40.920 and
00:03:41.130 then

00:03:41.820 stop
00:03:42.060 me
00:03:42.209 if
00:03:42.300 you've
00:03:42.420 heard
00:03:42.480 this
00:03:42.720 before
00:03:42.900 put

00:03:43.739 the
00:03:43.860 heat
00:03:44.070 on
00:03:44.100 high
00:03:44.580 bring
00:03:45.510 it
00:03:45.630 up
00:03:45.810 to
00:03:46.019 a
00:03:46.050 simmer

00:03:46.410 and
00:03:46.769 then
00:03:47.280 back
00:03:47.459 the
00:03:47.610 heat
00:03:47.790 down
00:03:47.970 to
00:03:48.030 low
00:03:48.209 maybe

00:03:48.900 just
00:03:49.500 over
00:03:49.680 low
00:03:50.070 to
00:03:50.670 maintain
00:03:51.180 a
00:03:51.209 steady

00:03:51.690 simmer
00:03:52.080 you
00:03:53.010 don't
00:03:53.130 want
00:03:53.250 a
00:03:53.310 rolling
00:03:53.670 boil
00:03:53.850 but

00:03:54.060 you
00:03:54.120 do
00:03:54.239 want
00:03:54.390 a
00:03:54.450 simmering
00:03:54.750 pretty
00:03:54.989 good
00:03:55.200 and

00:03:55.470 then
00:03:55.860 we're
00:03:55.950 gonna
00:03:56.040 simmer
00:03:56.280 this
00:03:56.430 for
00:03:56.489 about

00:03:56.700 an
00:03:56.850 hour
00:03:56.910 and
00:03:57.120 a
00:03:57.209 half
00:03:57.420 all
00:03:57.959 right
00:03:58.080 I
00:03:58.110 don't

00:03:58.260 cover
00:03:58.620 mine
00:03:58.890 I
00:03:59.220 like
00:03:59.580 to
00:03:59.670 watch
00:03:59.820 it
00:04:00.030 and
00:04:00.150 smell

00:04:00.390 it
00:04:00.420 if
00:04:00.900 it
00:04:01.050 looks
00:04:01.200 like
00:04:01.290 the
00:04:01.470 liquid
00:04:01.769 levels

00:04:02.070 getting
00:04:02.250 a
00:04:02.370 little
00:04:02.550 low
00:04:02.700 I'll
00:04:02.970 add
00:04:03.120 a
00:04:03.150 splash

00:04:03.390 of
00:04:03.600 stock
00:04:03.840 or
00:04:04.019 water
00:04:04.140 no
00:04:04.530 problem
00:04:04.890 there
00:04:05.070 and

00:04:05.340 after
00:04:05.820 about
00:04:05.970 an
00:04:06.090 hour
00:04:06.150 and
00:04:06.480 a
00:04:06.510 half
00:04:06.690 it's

00:04:06.959 going
00:04:07.110 to
00:04:07.170 look
00:04:07.290 something
00:04:07.560 similar
00:04:08.040 to
00:04:08.489 this

00:04:08.610 I
00:04:08.790 hope
00:04:09.000 alright
00:04:09.630 and
00:04:09.840 then
00:04:10.380 we're
00:04:10.500 going
00:04:10.590 to

00:04:10.650 evaluate
00:04:10.739 we're
00:04:11.519 going
00:04:11.640 to
00:04:11.700 take
00:04:11.850 a
00:04:11.880 fork

00:04:12.209 we're
00:04:12.959 going
00:04:13.080 to
00:04:13.140 test
00:04:13.320 the
00:04:13.500 doneness
00:04:13.709 of
00:04:13.799 the

00:04:14.100 meat
00:04:14.450 all
00:04:15.450 right
00:04:15.570 I
00:04:15.630 want
00:04:15.810 the
00:04:15.840 fork
00:04:16.140 to
00:04:16.260 go
00:04:16.350 in

00:04:16.470 the
00:04:16.560 meat
00:04:16.709 fairly
00:04:17.220 easily
00:04:17.430 yet
00:04:18.299 I
00:04:18.330 don't
00:04:18.450 want

00:04:18.810 the
00:04:18.900 meat
00:04:19.080 totally
00:04:19.470 falling
00:04:19.830 apart
00:04:19.890 so
00:04:20.400 let
00:04:21.269 me

00:04:21.359 check
00:04:21.540 this
00:04:21.810 and
00:04:22.169 that
00:04:22.950 was
00:04:23.070 almost
00:04:23.310 there
00:04:23.789 I

00:04:23.940 figured
00:04:24.180 I
00:04:24.360 needed
00:04:24.570 about
00:04:24.810 ten
00:04:25.110 fifteen
00:04:25.530 more

00:04:25.680 minutes
00:04:25.740 of
00:04:26.100 cooking
00:04:26.310 which
00:04:27.000 was
00:04:27.180 perfect

00:04:27.750 as
00:04:27.810 I
00:04:27.900 did
00:04:28.110 want
00:04:28.290 to
00:04:28.350 reduce
00:04:28.560 the
00:04:28.770 liquid
00:04:28.950 a

00:04:29.160 little
00:04:29.400 more
00:04:29.610 so
00:04:30.330 I
00:04:30.360 crank
00:04:30.690 the
00:04:30.780 heat
00:04:30.900 up
00:04:30.960 to

00:04:31.080 medium
00:04:31.230 I
00:04:31.920 cooked
00:04:32.580 that
00:04:32.640 for
00:04:32.910 another
00:04:33.060 10
00:04:33.390 or

00:04:33.420 15
00:04:33.630 minutes
00:04:34.230 which
00:04:35.100 left
00:04:35.400 me
00:04:35.670 with
00:04:35.700 this
00:04:36.540 one

00:04:37.290 of
