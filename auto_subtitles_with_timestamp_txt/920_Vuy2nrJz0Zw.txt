00:01:42.360 your

00:01:42.540 scrambled
00:01:42.840 eggs
00:01:43.170 will
00:01:43.500 really
00:01:44.100 dictate
00:01:44.970 how

00:01:45.570 they
00:01:45.750 come
00:01:46.020 out
00:01:46.170 at
00:01:46.320 the
00:01:46.440 end
00:01:46.470 so
00:01:47.429 my
00:01:47.880 problem

00:01:48.270 in
00:01:48.570 the
00:01:48.720 past

00:01:49.920 salsa
00:01:50.610 so
00:01:51.000 I

00:01:51.330 take
00:01:51.450 my
00:01:51.630 scrambled
00:01:52.140 eggs
00:01:52.289 and
00:01:52.500 I
00:01:52.560 would
00:01:52.740 put

00:01:52.920 salsa
00:01:53.429 in
00:01:53.610 it
00:01:53.759 and
00:01:53.910 then
00:01:54.060 I
00:01:54.179 would
00:01:54.240 cook
00:01:54.630 it
00:01:54.869 and

00:01:55.110 what
00:01:55.590 happens
00:01:56.039 is
00:01:56.220 is
00:01:56.429 it's
00:01:56.610 way
00:01:56.820 too
00:01:56.880 watery

00:01:57.570 it
00:01:58.140 takes
00:01:58.380 too
00:01:58.619 long
00:01:58.649 to
00:01:58.860 cook
00:01:59.250 and
00:01:59.550 they

00:02:00.570 and
00:02:00.869 muddy
00:02:01.229 looking
00:02:01.500 so
00:02:02.460 the
00:02:02.610 best

00:02:02.820 thing
00:02:03.090 to

00:02:30.840 a
00:02:30.870 nonstick
00:02:31.500 pan
00:02:31.560 but
00:02:32.520 we
00:02:32.640 want

00:02:32.880 the
00:02:33.030 flavor
00:02:33.330 of
00:02:33.720 the
00:02:33.870 butter
00:02:34.400 in
00:02:35.400 with

00:02:42.000 really
00:02:43.000 good

00:02:43.180 scrambled
00:02:43.720 eggs
00:02:43.900 is
00:02:44.230 to
00:02:44.860 cook
00:02:45.100 them
00:02:45.310 really

00:02:45.610 low
00:02:46.120 and
00:02:46.630 the
00:02:47.560 way
00:02:47.740 you
00:02:47.800 stir
00:02:48.430 them
00:02:48.780 really

00:02:49.780 will
00:02:50.500 create
00:02:51.420 fluffy
00:02:52.420 eggs
00:02:52.660 if
00:02:53.110 you
00:02:53.230 over
00:02:53.680 stir

00:02:54.040 it
00:02:55.140 your
00:02:56.140 eggs
00:02:56.410 will
00:02:57.420 just
00:02:58.420 look
00:02:58.660 flat
00:02:59.020 so
00:02:59.560 I'll

00:02:59.710 show
00:02:59.890 you
00:02:59.950 what
00:03:00.160 I
00:03:00.190 mean
00:03:00.810 so
00:03:01.810 we're
00:03:01.930 going
00:03:02.020 to

00:03:02.110 take
00:03:02.290 our
00:03:02.440 beaten
00:03:02.800 eggs
00:03:02.950 and
00:03:03.190 we're
00:03:03.700 going
00:03:03.820 to

00:03:03.880 put
00:03:04.090 them
00:03:04.180 in
00:03:04.300 the
00:03:04.390 pan
00:03:04.660 and
00:03:05.790 put
00:03:06.790 them
00:03:06.940 in
00:03:07.090 here

00:03:07.270 slowly
00:03:09.660 now
00:03:10.660 my
00:03:10.870 first
00:03:13.620 instinct
00:03:14.620 is
00:03:14.770 to
00:03:15.040 start

00:03:15.280 scrambling
00:03:16.060 them
00:03:16.210 right
00:03:16.830 but
00:03:17.830 all
00:03:18.400 that
00:03:18.700 does

00:03:19.000 is
00:03:19.030 result
00:03:19.750 in
00:03:19.930 a
00:03:20.020 bunch
00:03:20.230 of
00:03:20.350 curds
00:03:20.650 that
00:03:20.860 are

00:03:20.980 all
00:03:21.100 broken
00:03:21.430 up
00:03:21.730 and
00:03:22.000 that's
00:03:22.540 why
00:03:22.750 you
00:03:22.810 get

00:03:23.020 that
00:03:23.080 flat
00:03:23.650 look
00:03:24.070 to
00:03:24.340 them
00:03:24.520 what
00:03:25.210 you
00:03:25.390 want
00:03:25.600 to

00:03:25.720 do
00:03:25.870 is
00:03:26.170 you
00:03:26.320 want
00:03:26.560 them
00:03:26.680 to
00:03:26.860 start
00:03:27.160 cooking
00:03:27.550 and

00:03:29.740 cooking
00:03:30.250 you're

00:03:30.880 draw

00:03:31.210 up
00:03:31.540 the
00:03:31.570 cook
00:03:32.140 part
00:03:32.500 of

00:03:32.950 towards
00:03:33.640 the

00:03:33.790 middle
00:03:34.180 and
00:03:34.420 you're
00:03:34.840 going
