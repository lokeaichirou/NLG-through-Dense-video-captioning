00:03:59.820 a
00:04:03.480 nice
00:04:04.480 large
00:04:04.810 pan
00:04:05.200 with

00:04:05.590 roughly
00:04:05.950 a

00:04:06.670 inch
00:04:06.970 of
00:04:07.120 canola

00:04:14.620 but
00:04:15.370 that's
00:04:15.520 probably
00:04:16.120 the
00:04:16.270 best

00:04:20.830 be
00:04:20.920 nice
00:04:21.160 mark

00:04:21.790 put

00:04:21.910 it
