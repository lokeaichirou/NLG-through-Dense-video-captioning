00:01:36.399 a
00:01:36.669 little
00:01:37.029 burnt

00:01:37.299 so
00:01:38.109 I
00:01:38.439 prefer
00:01:38.889 using
00:01:39.159 a
00:01:39.340 pressure
00:01:39.549 cooker
00:01:39.909 so

00:01:39.939 that

00:01:40.509 have
00:01:40.689 everything

00:01:42.549 really
00:01:42.849 free
00:01:43.090 to

00:01:43.240 do
00:01:43.359 your
00:01:43.389 other
00:01:43.779 things
00:01:44.109 at
00:01:44.289 home
00:01:44.469 especially

00:01:45.099 when
00:01:45.219 it
00:01:45.279 comes
00:01:45.399 to
00:01:45.520 Martin
00:01:45.909 I
00:01:46.029 prefer
00:01:46.419 using
00:01:46.569 a

00:01:46.749 pressure
00:01:46.959 cooker
00:01:47.109 but
00:01:47.439 if
00:01:47.560 it's
00:01:47.739 chicken
00:01:48.009 or

00:01:48.310 any
00:01:48.520 other
00:01:48.789 meat
00:01:49.209 doing

00:01:49.869 any
00:01:50.020 other
00:01:50.109 pan

00:01:50.380 is
00:01:50.619 absolutely
00:01:51.189 fine
00:01:51.369 okay
00:01:51.939 so
00:01:51.999 the
00:01:52.149 oil
00:01:52.329 is

00:01:52.649 valuated
00:01:53.649 after
00:01:54.099 the
00:01:54.189 oil
00:01:54.399 is
00:01:54.579 heated
00:01:54.969 we

00:01:57.459 add
00:01:57.729 the
00:01:57.759 bay
00:01:58.060 leaf
00:01:58.299 then
00:01:58.749 we'll
00:01:58.989 add
00:01:59.200 some

00:01:59.229 cloves

00:02:00.700 add
00:02:00.939 too
00:02:01.179 much
00:02:01.329 of
00:02:01.389 the
00:02:01.630 whole

00:02:01.779 masalas
00:02:02.319 because
00:02:02.649 it's
00:02:02.799 very
00:02:03.099 powerful
00:02:03.399 in

00:02:03.759 flavor
00:02:04.119 and
00:02:04.389 apart
00:02:04.989 from
00:02:05.020 that
00:02:05.139 we

00:02:06.880 towards

00:02:07.329 the
00:02:07.450 end

00:02:07.719 so
00:02:07.899 after
00:02:08.289 cloves
00:02:08.560 you've
00:02:08.739 added

00:02:16.790 and
00:02:17.060 once
00:02:18.019 you
00:02:18.200 saute
00:02:18.530 this
00:02:18.829 you'll

00:02:19.040 automatically
00:02:19.549 get
00:02:19.849 the
00:02:20.060 flavor
00:02:20.420 of
00:02:20.719 all
00:02:21.200 the

00:02:21.469 whole
00:02:21.650 spices
00:02:21.680 in
00:02:22.340 this
00:02:22.489 whenever
00:02:23.000 you
00:02:23.090 have

00:02:23.209 to

00:02:25.310 the
00:02:25.340 whole
00:02:25.640 spices
00:02:25.939 and
00:02:26.239 then
00:02:26.450 you
00:02:26.810 add

00:02:26.959 onions
00:02:27.500 tomatoes
00:02:28.099 and
00:02:28.129 all
00:02:28.489 the
00:02:28.640 other
00:02:28.790 pastes

00:02:29.329 so
00:02:30.019 you
00:02:30.079 see
00:02:30.500 this
00:02:30.709 nicely
00:02:31.250 getting
00:02:31.849 sorted
00:02:32.239 so

00:02:32.810 after

00:02:33.950 add
00:02:34.010 onions
00:02:34.609 I

00:02:39.980 Manion

00:02:40.340 spine
00:02:40.819 is
00:02:41.120 that
00:02:41.420 the
00:02:41.689 Browning
00:02:42.170 happens

00:02:42.530 faster
00:02:43.069 you
00:02:43.280 see
00:02:43.489 this
00:02:43.549 more
00:02:44.180 the
00:02:44.329 onions

00:02:44.689 better
00:02:45.290 will
00:02:45.590 be
00:02:45.620 the
00:02:45.769 body
00:02:46.129 or

00:02:56.090 eight
00:02:56.209 minutes
00:02:56.480 if
00:02:56.750 your
00:02:56.900 onions
00:02:57.230 are
00:02:57.349 finely

00:02:57.709 chopped
00:02:57.950 and
00:02:58.250 you
00:02:58.370 will
00:02:58.459 find
00:02:58.669 a
00:02:58.730 lot
00:02:58.909 of
00:02:58.939 other

00:02:59.120 recipes
00:02:59.450 where
00:02:59.959 they
00:03:00.079 use
00:03:00.200 onion
00:03:00.590 paste
00:03:00.829 now

00:03:01.340 you
00:03:01.400 could
00:03:01.609 also
00:03:01.730 do
00:03:01.939 that
00:03:02.120 so
00:03:02.359 what
00:03:02.510 happens

00:03:02.840 when
00:03:02.930 you
00:03:03.049 grind
00:03:03.379 an

00:03:04.730 gets
00:03:05.030 evaporated
00:03:05.209 and
00:03:05.900 then
00:03:06.109 the
00:03:06.290 browning

00:03:06.680 happens
00:03:07.040 so
00:03:07.370 instead
00:03:07.700 of
00:03:07.790 doing
00:03:08.060 that
00:03:08.239 is

00:03:08.419 better
00:03:08.659 to
00:03:08.900 chop
00:03:09.169 it
00:03:09.319 up
00:03:09.409 like

00:03:14.510 pieces
00:03:14.780 that
00:03:15.109 I
00:03:15.139 have
00:03:15.379 your

00:03:20.180 bright
00:03:20.569 red
00:03:20.959 in

00:03:21.470 never
00:03:21.829 buy
00:03:22.190 pale
00:03:22.750 looking
00:03:23.750 mutton
00:03:24.169 you
00:03:24.290 see

00:03:24.470 this
00:03:24.620 it
00:03:24.889 needs
00:03:25.159 to
00:03:25.519 be
00:03:25.639 absolutely
00:03:26.540 bright

00:03:26.930 red
00:03:27.440 in
00:03:27.590 color
00:03:27.889 which
00:03:28.220 means
00:03:28.430 it
00:03:28.729 is
00:03:28.879 fresh

00:03:29.470 similarly
00:03:30.470 with
00:03:30.859 seafood
00:03:31.389 prawns
00:03:32.389 have
00:03:32.629 to

00:03:34.099 be
00:03:34.220 absolutely
00:03:34.729 white

00:03:35.120 and
00:03:35.419 if
00:03:36.019 a
00:03:36.139 fish
00:03:36.409 smells
00:03:36.979 fishy
00:03:37.430 which
00:03:38.150 means

00:03:38.419 it
00:03:38.659 is
00:03:38.689 not
00:03:39.019 good
00:03:39.290 so
00:03:39.530 let's
00:03:40.370 get
00:03:40.579 back
00:03:40.790 to
00:03:41.000 the

00:03:41.120 onions
00:03:41.419 you
00:03:41.659 see
00:03:41.840 this
00:03:42.019 now
00:03:42.379 it
00:03:42.620 started

00:03:42.949 getting
00:03:43.220 pink
00:03:43.729 which
00:03:44.120 means
00:03:44.419 it
00:03:44.629 will
00:03:44.720 start

00:03:44.780 browning
00:03:45.319 in
00:03:45.620 a
00:03:45.709 while
00:03:45.889 and
00:03:46.129 once
00:03:46.759 it
00:03:46.939 starts

00:03:47.299 drowning
00:03:47.810 do
00:03:47.959 not
00:03:48.139 leave
00:03:48.349 the
00:03:48.530 pan
00:03:48.769 because
00:03:49.129 it

00:03:49.250 is
00:03:49.400 born
00:03:49.909 very
00:03:50.419 quickly
00:03:50.750 so
00:03:51.049 we
00:03:51.199 just
00:03:51.349 want

00:03:51.650 nice
00:03:51.949 golden
00:03:52.549 onions

00:03:54.049 the
00:03:54.319 ginger
00:03:54.500 garlic
00:03:54.680 paste
00:03:55.009 now
00:03:55.609 what

00:03:55.819 happens
00:03:56.209 is
00:03:56.299 if
00:03:56.419 you
00:03:56.509 add
00:03:56.659 in
00:03:56.870 the
00:03:56.900 paste
00:03:57.199 right

00:03:57.470 now
00:03:57.739 the
00:03:58.129 onions
00:03:58.430 will
00:03:58.579 not
00:03:58.729 Brown
00:03:59.000 so
00:03:59.329 we
00:03:59.449 have

00:03:59.659 to
00:03:59.780 first
00:03:59.989 Brown
00:04:00.409 the
00:04:00.620 onions
00:04:00.949 and
00:04:01.159 then
00:04:01.370 add

00:04:01.639 whatever
00:04:01.970 other
00:04:02.299 spices
00:04:02.659 that
00:04:02.959 you
00:04:03.019 want
00:04:03.290 to

00:04:03.349 add
00:04:03.500 okay
00:04:04.009 now
00:04:04.159 we
00:04:04.220 are
00:04:04.400 going
00:04:04.579 to
00:04:04.639 be
00:04:04.699 adding

00:04:04.970 tomatoes
00:04:05.389 to
00:04:05.540 this
00:04:05.659 a
00:04:05.930 lot
00:04:06.319 of
00:04:06.439 recipes
00:04:06.709 also

00:04:07.159 suggest
00:04:07.699 using
00:04:07.879 yogurt
00:04:08.389 so
00:04:08.930 if
00:04:09.019 you
00:04:09.139 were
00:04:09.259 to

00:04:09.349 add
00:04:09.500 yogurt
00:04:09.709 in
00:04:10.040 your
00:04:10.159 recipe
00:04:10.519 avoid
00:04:11.299 the

00:04:11.419 tomatoes
00:04:11.840 because
00:04:12.139 if
00:04:12.290 you
00:04:12.379 add
00:04:12.530 yogurt
00:04:12.739 and

00:04:13.099 the
00:04:13.250 tomatoes
00:04:13.639 the
00:04:13.790 gravy
00:04:14.090 will
00:04:14.209 go
00:04:14.389 sour
00:04:14.659 and

00:04:14.870 we
00:04:15.409 do
00:04:15.530 not
00:04:15.650 want
00:04:15.949 a
00:04:16.070 sour
00:04:16.310 gravy
00:04:16.579 so
00:04:17.120 it's
00:04:17.449 up

00:04:17.630 to
00:04:17.780 you
00:04:17.930 I
00:04:18.199 prefer
00:04:18.709 using
00:04:18.859 tomatoes
00:04:19.370 because

00:04:19.639 the
00:04:19.759 color
00:04:19.940 goes
00:04:20.209 nice
00:04:20.509 and
00:04:20.539 red

00:04:21.169 apart
00:04:21.709 from
00:04:21.769 tomatoes
00:04:22.220 I
00:04:22.340 also
00:04:22.610 use
00:04:22.729 a

00:04:23.000 Kashmiri
00:04:23.570 red
00:04:23.870 chilli
00:04:24.289 powder
00:04:24.469 which
00:04:24.770 also

00:04:24.950 gives
00:04:25.279 very
00:04:25.700 good
00:04:25.789 color
00:04:26.150 to
00:04:26.330 the
00:04:26.419 gravy
00:04:26.659 okay

00:04:27.200 so
00:04:27.260 you
00:04:27.409 see
00:04:27.710 this
00:04:27.919 the
00:04:28.130 onion

00:04:28.620 have
00:04:28.710 started
00:04:29.310 turning
00:04:29.550 golden
00:04:30.419 we
00:04:30.810 will
00:04:30.900 now

00:04:31.080 start
00:04:31.410 adding
00:04:31.979 the
00:04:32.610 ginger-garlic
00:04:32.970 paste

00:04:33.270 first
00:04:33.840 because
00:04:34.350 that
00:04:34.380 also
00:04:34.889 takes
00:04:35.160 some
00:04:35.520 time

00:04:35.790 to
00:04:35.820 cook
00:04:36.300 the
00:04:36.990 raw
00:04:37.229 flavor
00:04:37.530 of
00:04:37.770 garlic
00:04:38.130 and

00:04:38.250 ginger
00:04:38.400 has
00:04:38.699 to
00:04:38.880 go
00:04:39.060 or
00:04:39.270 else
00:04:39.449 it
00:04:39.690 doesn't

00:04:40.020 leave
00:04:40.229 a
00:04:40.260 very
00:04:40.560 good
00:04:40.770 flavor
00:04:40.949 lingering
00:04:41.490 on

00:04:41.610 your
00:04:41.729 tongue
00:04:41.970 so
00:04:42.440 this
00:04:43.440 needs
00:04:43.740 to
00:04:43.860 be
00:04:43.949 sorted

00:04:44.220 along
00:04:44.669 with
00:04:44.910 the
00:04:45.180 onions
00:04:45.540 if
00:04:45.990 you
00:04:46.139 are

00:04:46.199 attending
00:04:46.440 to
00:04:46.710 the
00:04:46.800 pan
00:04:47.010 continuously
00:04:47.610 you

00:04:47.760 can
00:04:47.910 leave
00:04:48.120 the
00:04:48.270 flame
00:04:48.510 slightly
00:04:48.990 high
00:04:49.199 but
00:04:49.650 if

00:05:29.490 a
00:05:29.940 day
00:05:30.330 old
00:05:30.660 mutton
00:05:31.050 also
00:05:31.620 will
00:05:31.770 take

00:05:32.039 longer
00:05:32.520 time
00:05:32.849 to
00:05:32.880 cook
00:05:33.210 of
00:05:33.479 course
00:05:33.810 if
00:05:33.900 we
00:05:34.080 get

00:05:34.260 cooked
00:05:34.560 but
00:05:34.740 it
00:05:34.860 will
00:05:34.979 definitely
00:05:35.160 take
00:05:35.490 a

00:05:35.700 longer
00:05:36.150 time
00:05:36.889 after
00:05:37.889 you
00:05:38.340 have
00:05:38.490 added
00:05:38.700 the

00:05:38.910 mutton
00:05:39.360 let's
00:05:39.780 add
00:05:40.050 some
00:05:40.380 salt
00:05:40.410 here
00:05:40.979 and
00:05:43.130 this

00:05:44.130 needs
00:05:44.460 to
00:05:44.580 be
00:05:44.789 sorted
00:05:45.240 really
00:05:46.110 well
00:05:46.380 with
00:05:46.860 all

00:05:47.160 the
00:05:47.370 masalas
00:05:47.820 we
00:05:48.419 have
00:05:48.599 yet
00:05:48.930 not
00:05:48.960 added
00:05:49.680 as
00:05:49.740 our

00:05:49.860 tomatoes
00:05:50.310 that
00:05:50.729 we
00:05:50.970 will
00:05:51.120 add
00:05:51.270 after
00:05:51.570 we
00:05:52.050 see

00:05:52.500 or
00:05:52.590 the
00:05:52.740 mutton
00:05:53.099 will
00:05:53.310 I
00:05:53.490 believe
00:05:53.820 in
00:05:54.060 searing

00:05:54.539 the
00:05:54.660 mutton
00:05:54.960 along
00:05:55.289 with
00:05:55.440 the
00:05:55.530 masalas
00:05:55.979 the

00:05:56.160 searing
00:05:56.639 of
00:05:56.849 this
00:05:57.030 mixing
00:05:57.479 needs
00:05:57.750 to
00:05:57.870 be
00:05:57.960 done

00:05:58.110 on
00:05:58.199 high
00:05:58.470 heat
00:05:58.770 or
00:05:58.979 else
00:05:59.340 the
00:05:59.550 mutton
00:05:59.820 will

00:05:59.970 start
00:06:00.270 leaving
00:06:00.660 water
00:06:00.900 and
00:06:01.229 we
00:06:01.349 do
00:06:01.440 not
00:06:01.560 want

00:06:01.830 that
00:06:01.949 to
00:06:02.010 happen
00:06:02.250 at
00:06:02.520 this
00:06:02.699 stage
00:06:02.970 so
00:06:03.449 make

00:06:03.720 sure
00:06:03.960 the
00:06:04.199 flame
00:06:04.470 is
00:06:04.680 high
00:06:05.070 and
00:06:05.430 you
00:06:06.000 have
00:06:06.030 to

00:06:06.389 keep
00:06:06.599 on
00:06:06.840 mixing
00:06:07.080 this
00:06:07.410 in
00:06:07.979 the
00:06:08.160 meanwhile

00:06:08.639 let's
00:06:09.030 do
00:06:09.300 something
00:06:09.720 let's
00:06:09.900 add
00:06:10.169 some

00:06:10.710 coriander
00:06:11.669 also
00:06:12.330 your
00:06:12.539 I
00:06:12.750 prefer
00:06:13.370 sauteing

00:06:14.370 coriander
00:06:14.970 leaves
00:06:15.180 rather
00:06:15.870 than
00:06:16.199 adding
00:06:16.650 it

00:06:16.800 just
00:06:17.130 as
00:06:17.340 a
00:06:17.370 simple
00:06:17.669 garnish
00:06:18.180 so
00:06:19.020 let
00:06:19.199 the

00:06:19.380 coriander
00:06:19.830 also
00:06:20.340 get
00:06:20.520 roasted
00:06:21.120 in
00:06:21.270 the
00:06:21.510 masala

00:06:21.840 and
00:06:22.169 here
00:06:23.039 we
00:06:23.310 have
00:06:23.460 to
00:06:23.639 add
00:06:23.820 but
00:06:24.360 it
00:06:24.510 was
00:06:25.610 after

00:06:26.610 you
00:06:26.699 have
00:06:26.880 added
00:06:27.090 all
00:06:27.539 of
00:06:27.720 this
00:06:27.900 mix
00:06:28.410 it
00:06:28.590 again

00:06:28.680 nicely
00:06:29.190 since
00:06:30.030 we
00:06:30.210 are
00:06:30.270 using
00:06:30.449 the
00:06:30.780 kashmiri

00:06:31.229 red
00:06:31.289 chilli
00:06:31.440 powder
00:06:31.830 you
00:06:32.130 find
00:06:32.520 the
00:06:32.729 colour

00:06:33.150 going
00:06:33.479 red
00:06:33.780 and
00:06:33.990 a
00:06:34.289 red
00:06:34.620 mutton
00:06:34.979 curry

00:06:35.190 definitely
00:06:35.880 looks
00:06:36.090 very
00:06:36.479 appetizing

00:06:37.140 so
00:06:37.650 after
00:06:38.070 you
00:06:38.159 have
00:06:38.280 mixed
00:06:38.520 everything
00:06:38.880 well

00:06:39.330 it's
00:06:39.780 now
00:06:40.020 time
00:06:40.080 to
00:06:40.440 add

00:06:41.030 my
00:06:41.180 toes
00:06:41.390 so
00:06:42.140 let's
00:06:42.380 add
00:06:42.620 tomatoes
00:06:43.160 here
00:06:44.740 and

00:06:45.740 some
00:06:46.340 more
00:06:46.550 salt
00:06:48.100 we've
00:06:49.100 already
00:06:49.340 added
00:06:49.670 some

00:06:50.030 salt
00:06:50.270 in
00:06:50.450 the
00:06:50.540 beginning
00:06:50.930 so
00:06:51.140 now
00:06:51.440 a
00:06:51.710 little

00:06:52.250 less
00:06:52.610 and
00:06:53.140 again
00:06:54.140 just
00:06:54.650 give
00:06:54.980 it
00:06:55.100 a
00:06:55.220 mix
00:06:55.430 we

00:06:56.300 have
00:06:56.330 to
00:06:56.630 saute
00:06:56.930 this
00:06:57.230 till
00:06:57.530 the
00:06:57.560 tomatoes
00:06:57.740 go

00:06:58.250 slightly
00:06:58.700 soft
00:06:59.060 and
00:06:59.390 that's
00:06:59.690 when
00:06:59.990 we'll
00:07:00.140 add

00:07:00.320 water
00:07:00.590 and
00:07:00.890 let
00:07:00.950 this
00:07:01.400 cook
00:07:01.790 on
00:07:02.120 medium
00:07:03.050 heat

00:07:03.260 so
00:07:03.800 you
00:07:03.830 see
00:07:04.040 the
00:07:04.130 tomato
00:07:04.400 they've
00:07:04.610 gone
00:07:04.790 soft

00:07:05.120 let's
00:07:05.780 add
00:07:06.020 water
00:07:07.000 and
00:07:11.920 so
00:07:12.920 after
00:07:13.220 you
00:07:13.280 have

00:07:13.370 placed
00:07:13.520 the
00:07:13.700 lid
00:07:13.910 we
00:07:14.120 will
00:07:14.240 cook
00:07:14.540 this
00:07:14.870 till

00:07:15.170 about
00:07:15.260 6
00:07:15.740 missiles
00:07:16.130 are
00:07:16.280 given
00:07:16.520 out
00:07:16.640 on
00:07:16.760 medium

00:07:17.210 heat
00:07:17.360 of
00:07:17.570 course
00:07:17.810 if
00:07:18.140 it's
00:07:18.350 on
00:07:18.500 high
00:07:18.740 heat
00:07:19.010 it

00:07:19.160 could
00:07:19.400 be
00:07:19.550 anywhere
00:07:19.820 around
00:07:20.090 10
00:07:20.330 to
00:07:20.510 12

00:07:20.540 whistles
00:07:21.140 but
00:07:21.650 6
00:07:21.950 whistles
00:07:22.400 are
00:07:22.580 needham
00:07:22.970 heat

00:07:23.180 the
00:07:23.420 mutton
00:07:23.660 will
00:07:23.750 be
00:07:23.900 done
00:07:24.080 but
00:07:24.350 the
00:07:24.500 mutton

00:07:24.860 has
00:07:25.040 to
00:07:25.220 be
00:07:25.310 very
00:07:25.640 fresh
00:07:26.030 a
00:07:26.300 day
00:07:26.870 old
00:07:27.140 or
00:07:27.320 a
00:07:27.350 day

00:07:27.560 or
00:07:27.680 two
00:07:27.890 old
00:07:28.130 mutton
00:07:28.550 takes
00:07:29.150 more
00:07:29.600 time
00:07:29.810 to

00:07:30.050 cook
00:07:30.230 of
00:07:30.500 course
00:07:31.040 it
00:07:31.130 will
00:07:31.280 cook
00:07:31.520 but
00:07:31.850 maybe

00:07:32.420 about
00:07:32.900 10
00:07:33.440 missiles
00:07:33.770 after
00:07:34.430 the
00:07:34.580 whistles
00:07:34.880 are

00:07:35.000 given
00:07:35.240 out
00:07:35.390 let
00:07:35.600 the
00:07:35.780 pressure
00:07:35.960 cooker
00:07:36.380 rest

00:07:36.650 for
00:07:36.860 a
00:07:36.890 while
00:07:37.160 till
00:07:37.460 all
00:07:37.670 the
00:07:37.850 pressure

00:07:38.150 settles
00:07:38.600 down
00:07:38.810 and
00:07:39.050 then
00:07:39.290 we
00:07:39.440 will
00:07:39.560 see
00:07:39.800 how

00:07:39.980 the
00:07:40.040 mutton
00:07:40.430 curry
00:07:40.580 looks
00:07:40.910 right
00:07:41.330 now
00:07:41.540 we'll

00:07:41.900 wait
00:07:42.200 for
00:07:42.500 all
00:07:42.680 the
00:07:42.860 whistles
00:07:43.010 to
00:07:43.340 be
00:07:43.460 given

00:07:43.700 out
00:07:43.850 okay
00:07:44.570 so
00:07:44.600 now
00:07:44.840 let's
00:07:45.050 see
00:07:45.320 how
00:07:45.590 this

00:07:45.920 mutton
00:07:46.250 curry
00:07:46.580 looks
00:07:46.970 open
00:07:47.840 the
00:07:48.200 pressure

00:07:48.410 cooker
00:07:48.590 after
00:07:49.100 the
00:07:49.790 whistle
00:07:50.300 or
00:07:50.570 the
00:07:50.780 pressure

00:07:50.990 has
00:07:51.350 settled
00:07:51.770 down
00:07:51.920 the
00:07:52.640 color
00:07:52.880 is
00:07:53.090 perfect

00:07:53.360 let's
00:07:54.080 switch
00:07:54.380 on
00:07:54.620 the
00:07:54.770 heat
00:07:54.980 now
00:07:55.580 we
00:07:56.150 have
00:07:56.330 to

00:07:56.510 add
00:07:56.630 two
00:07:56.870 ingredients
00:07:57.440 here
00:07:57.590 one
00:07:58.580 is
00:07:58.910 the

00:07:59.420 garam
00:07:59.750 masala
00:08:00.110 powder
00:08:00.250 garam
00:08:01.250 masala
00:08:01.610 powder

00:08:01.700 should
00:08:02.150 always
00:08:02.420 be
00:08:02.750 added
00:08:02.930 towards
00:08:03.410 the
00:08:03.530 end

00:08:03.680 because
00:08:04.040 we
00:08:04.190 added
00:08:04.400 for
00:08:04.730 flavor
00:08:05.030 and

00:08:05.300 fragrance
00:08:06.200 so
00:08:06.830 in
00:08:06.950 this
00:08:07.160 case
00:08:07.430 it
00:08:07.760 is
00:08:08.030 just
00:08:08.420 for

00:08:08.660 flavor
00:08:08.900 and
00:08:09.080 fragrance
00:08:09.290 and
00:08:09.770 this
00:08:10.130 needs
00:08:10.400 to

00:08:10.580 be
00:08:10.700 added
00:08:10.970 towards
00:08:11.240 the
00:08:11.390 end
00:08:11.720 so
00:08:12.710 little
00:08:13.040 bit

00:08:13.190 of
00:08:13.280 garam
00:08:13.490 masala
00:08:13.820 powder
00:08:13.970 and
00:08:14.480 coriander
00:08:14.870 we

00:08:15.260 will
00:08:15.410 add
00:08:15.620 after
00:08:16.190 we
00:08:16.340 serve
00:08:16.760 this
00:08:17.000 the
