00:02:57.920 over
00:02:59.440 and

00:03:00.440 I
00:03:00.950 always
00:03:01.070 tell
00:03:02.019 my
00:03:03.019 students
00:03:03.440 like
00:03:03.680 when

00:03:03.829 we're
00:03:03.950 making
00:03:04.220 breads
00:03:04.850 and
00:03:05.060 stuff
00:03:05.329 especially

00:03:05.750 women
00:03:06.320 whose
00:03:06.530 arms
00:03:07.130 and
00:03:07.340 hands
00:03:07.850 might
00:03:08.060 not
00:03:08.209 be

00:03:08.299 as
00:03:08.390 strong
00:03:08.630 to
00:03:08.780 use
00:03:08.900 your
00:03:09.079 shoulders
00:03:09.410 you
00:03:09.620 know

00:03:09.650 to
00:03:09.829 get
00:03:09.980 but
00:03:10.340 right
00:03:10.519 behind
00:03:10.640 it
00:03:13.299 so
00:03:14.299 I
00:03:14.359 just

00:03:14.390 want
00:03:14.660 to
00:03:14.780 make
00:03:14.900 it
00:03:15.079 smooth

00:03:19.240 all
00:03:20.240 right
00:03:20.360 if
00:03:20.450 you
00:03:20.570 make
00:03:20.750 your
00:03:20.960 own
00:03:21.020 pierogi

00:03:21.800 and
00:03:22.040 eat
00:03:22.730 them
00:03:23.350 you'll
00:03:24.350 lose
00:03:24.620 weight
00:03:24.890 because

00:03:25.640 this
00:03:25.820 is
00:03:26.030 a
00:03:26.060 workout
00:03:26.800 it's
00:03:27.800 best
00:03:28.010 to
00:03:28.130 let
00:03:28.370 this

00:03:28.520 rest
00:03:28.850 for
00:03:29.090 about
00:03:29.180 ten
00:03:29.420 or
00:03:29.450 fifteen
00:03:29.660 minutes
00:03:30.050 so

00:03:30.500 that
00:03:30.650 the
00:03:31.280 gluten
00:03:31.760 and
00:03:31.850 the
00:03:31.970 flour
00:03:32.180 can
00:03:32.480 relax

00:03:32.780 and
00:03:33.080 be
00:03:33.230 able
00:03:33.290 to
00:03:33.410 roll
00:03:33.590 out
00:03:33.740 the
00:03:33.860 dough

00:03:33.890 without
00:03:34.280 it
00:03:34.400 bouncing
00:03:35.150 back
00:03:35.330 and
00:03:35.600 okay
00:03:35.900 it's

00:03:36.350 stretching
00:03:36.560 so
00:03:36.770 I
00:03:36.800 just
00:03:37.010 cover
00:03:37.220 it
00:03:37.310 with
00:03:37.400 a

00:03:37.490 little
00:03:37.760 flour
00:03:37.970 I
00:03:38.150 don't
00:03:38.360 want
00:03:38.480 to
00:03:38.540 mix
00:03:38.660 this

00:03:38.810 flour
00:03:39.080 in
00:03:39.320 but
00:03:39.470 just
00:03:39.500 to
00:03:39.740 prevent
00:03:40.070 it
00:03:40.160 from

00:03:41.030 next
00:03:41.480 up
00:03:41.600 time
00:03:41.840 to
00:03:41.960 make
00:03:42.080 the
00:03:42.230 filling
00:03:43.420 okay

00:03:44.420 our

00:03:47.630 you
00:03:48.050 know
00:03:48.140 not
00:03:48.320 browned
00:03:49.300 although

00:03:50.300 it's
00:03:50.450 not
00:03:50.630 a
00:03:50.660 crime
00:03:50.990 if
00:03:51.200 you
00:03:51.290 do
00:03:51.440 brown
00:03:51.980 the

00:03:52.130 relevants
00:03:52.580 not
00:03:52.730 going
00:03:52.850 to
