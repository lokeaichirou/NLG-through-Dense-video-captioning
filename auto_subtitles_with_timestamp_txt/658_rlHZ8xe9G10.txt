00:09:28.270 out

00:09:28.480 of
00:09:28.540 the
00:09:28.720 oven
00:09:28.810 it's
00:09:29.260 been
00:09:29.440 cooking
00:09:29.710 for
00:09:29.890 45

00:09:30.880 minutes
00:09:31.180 we've
00:09:32.110 let
00:09:32.290 it
00:09:32.470 settle
00:09:32.770 just
00:09:33.010 for
00:09:33.190 a

00:09:33.250 few
00:09:33.280 minutes
00:09:33.490 so
00:09:34.030 we
00:09:34.150 can
00:09:34.300 scoop
00:09:34.720 it
00:09:34.870 out
00:09:35.020 of

00:09:35.170 the
00:09:35.290 pan
00:09:35.560 and
00:09:36.130 it
00:09:36.250 comes
00:09:36.430 out
00:09:36.580 nice
00:09:36.790 and
00:09:36.850 easy

00:09:37.150 with

00:09:40.000 I've
00:09:40.990 also

00:09:42.090 ready-made
00:09:43.090 grier

00:09:43.570 because
00:09:43.870 that's

00:09:45.040 of
00:09:45.070 my
00:09:45.220 specialties

00:09:45.640 but
00:09:46.060 savory
00:09:47.050 beef
00:09:47.410 gravy
00:09:47.770 works
00:09:48.250 wonderfully

00:09:48.820 with
00:09:48.850 up
00:09:49.150 just
