00:05:37.630 way
00:05:37.840 when
00:05:38.050 I
00:05:38.080 think
00:05:38.350 that
00:05:38.650 have
00:05:38.830 a
00:05:38.860 nice

00:05:39.190 crust
00:05:39.790 on
00:05:40.060 the
00:05:40.240 top
00:05:40.270 from
00:05:40.810 the
00:05:40.840 cheese

00:05:50.090 so
00:05:51.090 what
00:05:51.210 I'm
00:05:51.300 gonna
00:05:51.419 do
00:05:51.689 is
00:05:51.960 put
00:05:52.259 this
00:05:52.349 in
00:05:52.530 the

00:05:52.620 oven
00:05:52.770 on
00:05:53.069 350
00:05:53.699 to
00:05:54.090 375
00:05:54.650 for
00:05:55.650 approximately
00:05:56.340 45

00:05:56.699 minutes
00:05:56.909 with
00:05:57.479 the
00:05:57.599 foil
00:05:57.870 on
00:05:58.080 after
00:05:58.620 the
00:05:58.710 45

00:05:59.159 minutes
00:05:59.490 are
00:05:59.639 up
00:05:59.669 I'm
00:06:00.029 gonna
00:06:00.360 take
00:06:00.719 the
00:06:01.259 foil

00:06:01.560 off
00:06:01.800 and
00:06:02.189 just
00:06:02.729 let
00:06:03.330 it
00:06:03.479 cook
00:06:03.870 on
00:06:04.080 the
00:06:04.229 top
00:06:04.439 so

00:06:04.710 that
00:06:04.740 it
00:06:05.009 gets
00:06:05.189 a
00:06:05.310 nice
00:06:05.520 even
00:06:05.969 browning
00:06:06.240 on
00:06:06.509 the

00:06:06.539 top
00:06:06.629 and

00:06:09.779 under
00:06:09.990 your
00:06:10.110 broiler

00:06:10.710 watch
00:06:10.889 that

00:06:10.919 closely
00:06:11.580 because
00:06:11.999 the
00:06:12.270 broiler
00:06:12.569 has
00:06:12.719 a

00:06:12.749 tendency
00:06:13.319 to
00:06:13.469 work
00:06:13.620 really
00:06:14.069 fast
00:06:14.370 and
00:06:14.639 it
00:06:14.789 will

00:06:14.939 burn
00:06:15.090 your
00:06:15.300 food
