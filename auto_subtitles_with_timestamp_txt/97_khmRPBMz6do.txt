00:00:41.219 sashimi
00:00:41.850 grade
00:00:41.879 tuna
00:00:42.059 it's

00:00:42.510 very
00:00:42.840 important
00:00:43.379 because
00:00:43.710 of
00:00:44.040 the
00:00:44.129 freshness

00:00:44.399 and
00:00:44.730 the

00:00:51.660 use
00:00:51.899 your

00:00:52.260 because
00:00:52.620 the
00:00:52.800 tuna
00:00:53.100 is
00:00:53.190 really
00:00:53.489 tender
00:00:53.910 and

00:00:54.120 then

00:00:59.520 some
00:00:59.760 green
00:00:59.969 onions
00:01:03.229 then
