00:04:11.739 in
00:04:11.859 there
00:04:12.239 and
00:04:14.010 then
00:04:15.010 pinching

00:04:25.900 and
00:04:26.050 with
00:04:26.560 experience
00:04:27.160 you'll
00:04:27.490 be

00:04:36.010 lot
00:04:36.250 of
00:04:36.400 water
00:04:36.669 because
00:04:37.240 if

00:04:37.360 the

00:04:37.990 are
00:04:38.169 too
00:04:38.880 crowded
00:04:39.880 and
00:04:40.290 the

00:04:41.290 water
00:04:41.500 takes
00:04:41.800 too
00:04:41.979 long
00:04:42.010 to
00:04:42.220 come
00:04:42.610 back
00:04:42.790 to
00:04:43.000 a

00:04:43.030 boil
00:04:43.350 they're

00:04:49.419 one

00:04:49.570 by
00:04:49.780 one
00:04:49.979 you

00:04:53.650 spoon
00:04:53.860 to
00:04:54.010 make
00:04:54.220 sure
00:04:54.430 that
00:04:54.580 they're

00:04:54.729 not
00:04:54.820 sticking
00:04:55.090 to
00:04:55.330 the
00:04:55.419 bottom
00:04:55.780 and
00:04:56.070 then
00:04:57.070 it

00:04:57.160 takes
00:04:57.310 about
00:04:57.430 three
00:04:57.760 minutes
00:04:57.880 for

00:05:02.410 as
00:05:02.950 they
00:05:03.130 are
00:05:03.280 and
00:05:03.550 the
00:05:03.760 water
00:05:03.970 should

00:05:04.240 be
00:05:04.270 vigorously
00:05:04.780 boiling
00:05:05.260 okay
