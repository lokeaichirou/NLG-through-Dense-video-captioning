00:00:00.260 okay
00:00:01.290 I'm
00:00:01.500 originally
00:00:01.770 from
00:00:02.070 Sheboygan

00:00:02.700 Wisconsin
00:00:02.730 and
00:00:03.449 that
00:00:03.480 happens
00:00:04.020 to
00:00:04.080 be
00:00:04.140 ground

00:00:04.470 zero
00:00:04.589 for
00:00:05.040 bratwurst
00:00:05.430 period
00:00:06.060 I
00:00:06.240 believe
00:00:06.569 the

00:00:06.960 correct
00:00:07.230 method
00:00:07.560 for
00:00:07.710 making
00:00:07.830 brats
00:00:08.220 is

00:00:08.460 genetically
00:00:08.910 imprinted
00:00:09.330 on
00:00:09.570 my
00:00:09.719 DNA
00:00:10.170 so
00:00:10.230 this

00:00:10.620 is
00:00:10.710 not
00:00:10.830 just
00:00:10.889 my
00:00:11.250 opinion
00:00:11.400 it's
00:00:12.030 science
00:00:12.830 so

00:00:13.830 we
00:00:14.190 start
00:00:14.429 with
00:00:14.490 the
00:00:14.610 brats
00:00:14.820 now
00:00:15.360 there
00:00:15.509 are

00:00:15.599 thousands
00:00:16.020 of
00:00:16.049 types
00:00:16.320 some
00:00:16.770 are
00:00:16.890 good
00:00:17.039 most

00:00:17.490 aren't
00:00:17.779 first
00:00:18.779 thing
00:00:19.050 do
00:00:19.710 not
00:00:19.740 get
00:00:20.460 precooked

00:00:21.150 brats
00:00:21.449 you
00:00:21.750 can
00:00:22.529 find
00:00:22.740 good
00:00:22.859 ones
00:00:23.070 if
00:00:23.189 you're

00:00:23.310 lucky
00:00:23.490 locally
00:00:24.150 but
00:00:24.720 Johnsonville
00:00:25.470 brats
00:00:25.650 are

00:00:25.920 available
00:00:26.369 all
00:00:26.550 over
00:00:26.789 the
00:00:26.880 US
00:00:27.150 they're
00:00:27.480 made

00:00:27.660 in
00:00:27.779 Sheboygan
00:00:28.289 and
00:00:28.439 they're
00:00:28.740 excellent

00:00:29.390 another
00:00:30.390 thing
00:00:30.630 is
00:00:30.750 the
00:00:30.869 roll
00:00:31.050 a
00:00:31.289 few
00:00:31.619 bakeries

00:00:31.980 in
00:00:32.009 the
00:00:32.189 Sheboygan
00:00:32.430 area
00:00:32.850 make
00:00:33.030 the
00:00:33.149 perfect

00:00:33.390 hard
00:00:33.750 roll
00:00:33.960 these
00:00:34.770 are
00:00:34.920 not
00:00:35.040 readily

00:00:35.399 available
00:00:35.579 and
00:00:36.329 an
00:00:36.989 acceptable
00:00:37.500 substitute

00:00:37.710 is
00:00:38.190 a
00:00:38.219 Kaiser
00:00:38.579 bun

00:00:39.239 I
00:00:39.270 suggest
00:00:39.840 staying
00:00:40.020 away
00:00:40.170 from
00:00:40.230 the
00:00:40.469 white

00:00:40.800 bread
00:00:41.040 Pam
00:00:41.399 burger
00:00:41.640 buns
00:00:41.850 and
00:00:42.059 those
00:00:42.149 things

00:00:42.360 called
00:00:42.570 brought
00:00:42.930 buns
00:00:43.200 because
00:00:43.379 those
00:00:44.160 are

00:00:44.309 just
00:00:44.430 hot
00:00:44.760 dog
00:00:44.940 buns
00:00:45.149 anyway
00:00:45.480 if
00:00:46.050 you
00:00:46.200 can't

00:00:46.410 find
00:00:46.590 a
00:00:46.710 real
00:00:46.860 hard
00:00:47.070 roll
00:00:47.250 go
00:00:47.460 for
00:00:47.640 the
00:00:47.700 Kaiser

00:00:47.910 bun
00:00:48.379 now
00:00:49.379 to
00:00:49.440 cook
00:00:49.710 them
00:00:49.950 charcoal
00:00:50.489 is

00:00:50.640 recommended
00:00:51.239 but
00:00:51.390 a
00:00:51.420 gas
00:00:51.629 grill
00:00:51.870 will
00:00:52.379 do

00:00:52.620 whatever
00:00:53.280 you
00:00:53.460 do
00:00:53.610 don't
00:00:53.910 close
00:00:54.180 the
00:00:54.329 cover

00:00:54.750 you
00:00:54.960 need
00:00:55.170 the
00:00:55.289 brats
00:00:55.500 of
00:00:55.680 course
00:00:55.949 tongs
00:00:56.489 a

00:00:56.820 squirt
00:00:57.180 bottle
00:00:57.239 and
00:00:57.690 a
00:00:58.170 beverage

00:00:59.989 remember
00:01:00.989 this
00:01:01.289 is
00:01:01.440 man
00:01:01.680 land
00:01:01.949 so
00:01:02.280 something

00:01:02.609 you
00:01:02.730 do
00:01:02.879 not
00:01:03.149 need
00:01:03.390 is
00:01:03.629 your
00:01:03.780 swallows

00:01:04.260 telling
00:01:04.530 you
00:01:04.589 how
00:01:04.710 to
00:01:04.739 do
00:01:04.979 it
00:01:06.680 so
00:01:07.680 you
00:01:07.740 want

00:01:08.070 your
00:01:08.189 fire
00:01:08.400 one
00:01:08.790 coal
00:01:09.060 deep
00:01:09.330 not
00:01:09.840 terribly
00:01:10.260 hot

00:01:10.530 maybe
00:01:10.860 six
00:01:11.460 or
00:01:11.610 eight
00:01:11.729 inches
00:01:11.760 below
00:01:12.210 the

00:01:12.330 grate
00:01:12.659 and
00:01:13.080 on
00:01:13.740 they
00:01:14.100 go
00:01:14.130 oh
00:01:15.170 one
00:01:16.170 thing
00:01:16.439 do
00:01:16.950 not

00:01:17.130 pre
00:01:17.460 cook
00:01:17.729 these
00:01:17.909 in
00:01:17.970 any
00:01:18.240 way
00:01:18.479 we
00:01:18.659 don't
00:01:18.810 boil

00:01:19.080 them
00:01:19.320 first
00:01:19.530 nothing
00:01:20.130 they
00:01:20.369 go

00:01:20.970 right

00:01:21.390 onto
00:01:21.689 the
00:01:21.780 grill
00:01:21.960 I
00:01:22.200 mean
00:01:22.530 you
00:01:22.799 don't
00:01:22.860 blow

00:01:23.070 your
00:01:23.280 steak
00:01:23.580 before
00:01:23.909 you're
00:01:24.000 thrown
00:01:24.180 on
00:01:24.330 the

00:01:24.420 grill
00:01:24.600 do
00:01:24.720 you
00:01:26.479 because
00:01:27.479 they're
00:01:27.689 uncovered

00:01:28.259 you'll
00:01:28.409 occasionally
00:01:28.710 get
00:01:29.100 a
00:01:29.130 flare-up

00:01:29.430 that's
00:01:29.970 what
00:01:30.150 the
00:01:30.240 squirt
00:01:30.420 bottle
00:01:30.720 is
00:01:30.810 for

00:01:37.530 now
00:01:38.530 these
00:01:38.770 are
00:01:38.920 looking
00:01:39.130 good
00:01:39.280 now
00:01:40.030 this

00:01:40.270 one's
00:01:40.450 not
00:01:40.600 quite
00:01:40.960 ready

00:01:41.290 turn
00:01:46.770 with
00:01:47.770 the

00:01:47.890 right
00:01:48.040 fire
00:01:48.280 we
00:01:48.550 want
00:01:48.730 to
00:01:48.790 do
00:01:48.850 about
00:01:49.060 five

00:01:49.330 minutes

00:01:50.320 four
00:01:50.830 sides
00:01:51.160 about

00:01:52.090 minutes
00:01:52.360 total
00:02:01.290 let

00:02:02.560 you
00:02:02.650 there
00:02:02.800 is

00:02:02.920 nothing
00:02:03.430 like
00:02:03.550 the
00:02:03.730 smell
00:02:03.850 of
00:02:04.000 broad
00:02:04.270 smoke
00:02:04.570 on

00:02:04.810 a
00:02:04.840 summer
00:02:05.170 afternoon
00:02:14.520 when
00:02:15.520 they're
00:02:15.640 all
00:02:15.760 nice

00:02:15.970 and
00:02:16.180 dark
00:02:16.330 brown
00:02:16.510 they're
00:02:16.870 ready
00:02:17.080 to
00:02:17.140 come
00:02:17.350 off

00:02:17.380 and
00:02:17.740 it's
00:02:17.830 time
00:02:17.890 for
00:02:18.100 the
00:02:18.370 next
00:02:18.490 step
00:02:22.740 okay
00:02:23.740 now

00:02:23.920 we're
00:02:24.160 going
00:02:24.280 to
00:02:24.400 simmer
00:02:24.610 them
00:02:24.790 in
00:02:24.910 beer
00:02:25.060 for
00:02:25.240 a

00:02:25.300 little
00:02:25.480 while
00:02:25.630 now
00:02:26.140 you
00:02:26.200 don't
00:02:26.380 need
00:02:26.500 your

00:02:26.590 expensive
00:02:27.130 micro
00:02:27.459 brewery
00:02:27.790 in
00:02:27.940 port
00:02:28.209 for
00:02:28.450 this

00:02:28.600 just
00:02:29.020 about
00:02:29.170 anything
00:02:29.530 will
00:02:29.680 do
00:02:29.830 you
00:02:30.520 can
00:02:30.610 also

00:02:30.760 put
00:02:31.000 a
00:02:31.030 little
00:02:31.180 butter
00:02:31.450 in
00:02:31.540 here
00:02:31.870 and
00:02:32.080 some

00:02:32.320 people
00:02:32.620 even
00:02:32.740 cut
00:02:33.130 up
00:02:33.220 onions
00:02:33.370 and
00:02:33.790 put
00:02:33.910 those

00:02:34.030 in
00:02:34.270 too
00:02:34.450 but
00:02:35.050 remember
00:02:35.410 we're
00:02:35.590 going
00:02:35.770 to

00:02:35.860 simmer
00:02:36.220 not
00:02:36.580 boil
00:02:36.970 if
00:02:37.360 you
00:02:37.540 did
00:02:37.720 this
00:02:37.840 right

00:02:38.110 they're
00:02:38.320 already
00:02:38.620 cooked
00:02:39.840 as
00:02:40.840 I
00:02:40.989 said
00:02:41.200 earlier

00:02:41.500 hard
00:02:41.800 rolls
00:02:41.980 are
00:02:42.160 hard
00:02:42.340 to
00:02:42.459 find
00:02:42.640 but
00:02:42.940 here's

00:02:43.209 what
00:02:43.360 one
00:02:43.510 looks
00:02:43.720 like
00:02:43.780 now
00:02:44.530 we
00:02:44.590 put
00:02:44.800 a
00:02:44.830 little

00:02:44.860 butter
00:02:45.130 on
00:02:45.220 the
00:02:45.400 Roll
00:02:45.580 and
00:02:45.610 for
00:02:46.120 me
00:02:46.209 a
00:02:46.239 slice

00:02:46.540 Iranian
00:02:47.170 and
00:02:47.380 it
00:02:47.620 is
00:02:47.739 ready
00:02:48.070 to
00:02:48.220 go

00:02:48.550 I
00:02:48.580 guess
00:02:49.420 ketchup
00:02:49.870 and
00:02:50.019 mustard
00:02:50.140 and

00:02:50.380 sauerkraut
00:02:50.800 are
00:02:51.250 okay
00:02:51.610 but
00:02:51.850 I
00:02:51.910 usually
00:02:52.239 only

00:02:52.360 use
00:02:52.570 that
00:02:52.750 stuff
00:02:52.959 at
00:02:53.140 the
00:02:53.260 company
00:02:53.620 picnic

00:02:53.950 when
00:02:54.100 they're
00:02:54.250 making
00:02:54.370 precooked
00:02:55.120 using
00:02:55.450 your

00:02:55.600 brats
00:02:55.900 or
00:02:56.140 something
00:02:56.380 like
00:02:56.500 that
00:02:56.650 you
00:02:56.800 know

00:02:56.920 just
00:02:57.100 to
00:02:57.370 cover
00:02:57.700 up
00:02:57.850 the
00:02:57.940 taste
00:02:58.090 oh
00:02:58.390 and
00:02:59.230 it's

00:02:59.440 also
00:02:59.590 best
00:02:59.980 to
00:03:00.100 eat
