00:00:55.379 around
00:00:55.770 as
00:00:56.610 well

00:00:57.180 up
00:00:57.270 the
00:00:57.390 bottom
00:00:57.690 until
00:00:58.350 basically
00:00:58.500 we
00:00:58.829 just

00:00:58.859 have
00:00:59.070 that
00:00:59.309 white
00:00:59.520 root
00:01:00.109 and
00:01:01.109 once
00:01:01.320 that's

00:01:01.410 been
00:01:01.559 trimmed
00:01:01.859 up
00:01:01.980 what
00:01:02.160 we'll
00:01:02.250 do
00:01:02.370 is
00:01:02.460 we'll

00:01:02.550 cut
00:01:02.760 like
00:01:02.910 quarter-inch
00:01:03.359 slices
00:01:03.480 and
00:01:04.280 then

00:01:05.280 we'll
00:01:05.369 take
00:01:05.519 those
00:01:05.640 slices
00:01:05.909 and
00:01:06.210 cut
00:01:06.299 them

00:01:06.420 into
00:01:06.510 about
00:01:06.600 quarter-inch
00:01:07.320 sticks
00:01:07.850 and
00:01:08.850 you

00:01:08.939 know
00:01:09.060 what
00:01:09.210 let's
00:01:09.299 go
00:01:09.479 ahead
00:01:09.540 and
00:01:09.689 loop

00:01:09.780 dangerously
00:01:10.290 and
00:01:10.409 do
00:01:10.799 two
00:01:10.979 at
00:01:11.130 once
00:01:11.689 thereby

00:01:12.689 doubling
00:01:12.780 our
00:01:13.170 production
00:01:13.560 speed
00:01:13.850 and
00:01:14.850 once

00:01:15.030 we've
00:01:15.180 cut
00:01:15.360 those
00:01:15.509 in
00:01:15.630 the
00:01:15.720 sticks
00:01:16.020 as
00:01:16.350 you

00:01:16.590 well
00:01:16.770 know
00:01:16.799 all
00:01:17.310 we
00:01:17.549 need
00:01:17.700 to
00:01:17.729 do
00:01:17.909 is
00:01:18.030 turn
00:01:18.240 them

00:01:18.509 and
00:01:18.750 cut
00:01:19.409 them
00:01:19.530 into
00:01:19.650 nice
00:01:19.860 fairly
00:01:20.369 even
00:01:20.640 cubes

00:01:21.350 so
00:01:22.350 we
00:01:22.380 will
00:01:22.619 cube
00:01:22.860 up
00:01:22.979 our
00:01:23.130 celery
00:01:23.430 roots
00:01:23.750 and

00:01:24.750 once
00:01:24.900 that's
00:01:25.080 done
00:01:25.200 what
00:01:25.380 we'll
00:01:25.470 do
00:01:25.560 is
00:01:25.650 we'll

00:01:25.740 toss
00:01:25.920 it
00:01:26.070 in
00:01:26.159 some
00:01:26.310 cold
00:01:26.520 water
00:01:26.700 and
00:01:27.030 just
00:01:27.409 let

00:01:28.409 it
00:01:28.530 sit
00:01:28.680 there
00:01:28.710 while
00:01:28.979 we're
00:01:29.130 prepping
00:01:29.369 our

00:01:29.610 other
00:01:29.790 ingredients
00:01:30.360 and
00:01:30.509 this
00:01:31.200 is
00:01:31.350 not
00:01:31.500 so

00:01:31.650 much
00:01:31.680 to
00:01:31.829 prevent
00:01:32.100 discoloration
00:01:32.939 but
00:01:33.540 I
00:01:33.600 want

00:01:33.810 those
00:01:33.900 cubes
00:01:34.259 to
00:01:34.320 be
00:01:34.409 fully
00:01:34.619 hydrated
00:01:35.100 and

00:01:35.369 also
00:01:36.000 I
00:01:36.030 think
00:01:36.150 that
00:01:36.390 water
00:01:36.540 might
00:01:36.810 leach
00:01:36.990 away

00:01:37.020 just
00:01:37.470 a
00:01:37.560 little
00:01:37.829 bit
00:01:37.920 of
00:01:38.009 the
00:01:38.100 bitterness
00:01:38.189 but

00:01:39.150 I
00:01:39.210 can't
00:01:39.479 prove
00:01:39.630 it
00:01:39.780 but
00:01:40.650 anyway
00:01:40.829 regardless

00:01:41.310 I'm
00:01:41.430 gonna
00:01:41.549 leave
00:01:41.640 mine
00:01:41.820 in
00:01:41.850 some
00:01:42.060 cold
00:01:42.270 water

00:01:42.329 and
00:01:42.689 move
00:01:43.380 on
00:01:43.530 to
00:01:43.680 the
00:01:43.799 next
00:01:44.009 thing
00:01:44.100 you
00:01:44.189 want

00:01:44.220 to
00:01:44.399 prep
00:01:44.579 ahead
00:01:44.759 of
00:01:44.880 time
00:01:45.090 your
00:01:45.540 walnuts
00:01:46.220 so

00:01:47.220 we're
00:01:47.340 going
00:01:47.460 to
00:01:47.520 toast
00:01:47.640 a
00:01:47.820 handful
00:01:48.149 of
00:01:48.270 walnut

00:01:48.630 pieces
00:01:49.020 in
00:01:49.259 a
00:01:49.380 dry
00:01:49.680 pan
00:01:49.950 over
00:01:50.280 medium
00:01:50.610 heat

00:01:50.790 just
00:01:51.149 throw
00:01:52.020 them
00:01:52.140 in
00:01:52.259 and
00:01:52.500 toss
00:01:52.619 them
00:01:52.799 around

00:01:53.000 until
00:01:54.000 basically
00:01:54.390 they
00:01:54.540 smell
00:01:54.810 like
00:01:54.990 toasted

00:01:55.350 walnuts
00:01:55.680 and
00:01:55.979 it's
00:01:56.640 really
00:01:56.820 not
00:01:56.909 that
00:01:56.969 easy
00:01:57.119 to

00:01:57.329 see
00:01:57.479 I
00:01:57.509 camera
00:01:57.810 here
00:01:58.079 but
00:01:58.259 they
00:01:58.950 are
00:01:59.070 going
00:01:59.189 to

00:01:59.250 turn
00:01:59.399 a
00:01:59.460 little
00:01:59.640 bit
00:01:59.850 golden
00:02:00.210 and
00:02:01.140 you
00:02:01.200 might

00:02:01.350 see
00:02:01.469 a
00:02:01.500 few
00:02:01.560 brown
00:02:01.890 marks
00:02:02.159 here
00:02:02.310 and
00:02:02.399 there
00:02:02.520 but

00:02:03.119 we
00:02:03.240 don't
00:02:03.450 want
00:02:03.570 to
00:02:03.600 go
00:02:03.719 too
00:02:03.780 far
00:02:04.079 take
00:02:04.560 a
00:02:04.590 dark

00:02:04.890 brown
00:02:04.920 they're
00:02:05.189 going
00:02:05.310 to
00:02:05.369 be
00:02:05.460 too
00:02:05.610 bitter
00:02:05.790 so

00:02:06.630 like
00:02:06.750 I
00:02:06.840 said
00:02:07.020 the
00:02:07.110 best
00:02:07.200 indication
00:02:07.649 is
00:02:07.860 just

00:02:08.039 toss
00:02:08.190 those
00:02:08.399 around
00:02:08.580 in
00:02:08.759 the
00:02:08.849 dry
00:02:09.030 pan
00:02:09.270 until

00:02:09.599 they
00:02:09.690 sort
00:02:09.929 of
00:02:10.050 smell
00:02:10.259 like
00:02:10.440 toasted
00:02:10.770 walnuts

00:02:11.400 at
00:02:11.879 which
00:02:12.000 point
00:02:12.030 we'll
00:02:12.300 transfer
00:02:12.660 those
00:02:12.780 onto

00:02:12.840 a
00:02:13.080 plate
00:02:13.349 to
00:02:13.470 cool

00:02:13.890 because
00:02:14.460 of
00:02:14.580 course
00:02:14.700 the
00:02:14.850 last
00:02:15.000 thing
00:02:15.120 you

00:02:15.300 want
00:02:15.480 on
00:02:15.569 your
00:02:15.630 salad
00:02:15.990 is
00:02:16.080 hot
00:02:16.290 nuts
00:02:16.520 so
00:02:17.520 we

00:02:17.610 will
00:02:17.760 set
00:02:17.910 those
00:02:18.030 aside
00:02:18.090 and
00:02:18.390 let
00:02:18.600 them
00:02:18.690 cool

00:02:18.840 off
00:02:19.050 while
00:02:19.800 we
00:02:19.950 move
00:02:20.100 on
00:02:20.250 to
00:02:20.430 the
00:02:20.520 next
00:02:20.640 thing

00:02:20.850 on
00:02:21.000 the
00:02:21.090 prep
00:02:21.300 list
00:02:21.510 the
00:02:21.930 dressing
00:02:22.470 which
00:02:23.340 is

00:02:23.490 ridiculously
00:02:24.060 simple
00:02:24.300 so
00:02:25.200 in
00:02:25.290 a
00:02:25.319 bowl
00:02:25.500 we're

00:02:25.620 going
00:02:25.709 to
00:02:25.770 start
00:02:26.010 with
00:02:26.130 three
00:02:26.340 parts

00:02:26.640 mayonnaise
00:02:27.000 to
00:02:27.690 which
00:02:27.840 we're
00:02:28.020 going
00:02:28.110 to
00:02:28.170 add

00:02:28.290 one
00:02:28.530 part
00:02:28.770 sour

00:02:29.700 or
00:02:29.850 creme
00:02:30.060 fraiche
00:02:30.360 and

00:02:31.140 I
00:02:31.230 think
00:02:31.410 it's
00:02:31.500 pretty
00:02:31.680 obvious
00:02:31.740 which
00:02:32.100 one

00:02:32.130 I'm
00:02:32.370 using
00:02:32.580 and
00:02:32.880 then
00:02:33.510 to
00:02:33.630 that
00:02:33.750 we're
00:02:33.900 going

00:02:33.990 to
00:02:34.080 add
00:02:34.200 a
00:02:34.500 little
00:02:34.950 bit
00:02:35.070 of
00:02:35.100 sugar
00:02:35.370 just
00:02:35.670 a

00:02:36.660 couple
00:02:36.840 pinches
00:02:37.370 as
00:02:38.370 well
00:02:38.610 as
00:02:38.700 a
00:02:38.760 pinch
00:02:39.000 of

00:02:39.090 salt
00:02:39.270 a
00:02:39.739 little
00:02:40.739 touch
00:02:40.890 of
00:02:40.920 freshly

00:02:41.760 black
00:02:41.940 pepper
00:02:42.030 and
00:02:42.500 then
00:02:43.500 of
00:02:43.620 course
00:02:43.890 so

00:02:44.010 everything
00:02:44.340 tastes
00:02:44.550 better
00:02:44.640 a
00:02:44.819 little
00:02:45.120 touch

00:02:45.270 of
00:02:45.300 cayenne

00:05:43.680 go
00:05:43.800 ahead

00:05:45.630 I
00:05:45.780 just
00:05:46.080 love
00:05:46.350 the

00:05:46.560 combination

00:05:54.870 celery
00:05:55.500 stalks
00:05:55.830 I

00:05:56.130 think
00:05:56.730 by
00:05:56.820 using
00:05:57.060 the
00:05:57.180 root
00:05:57.330 we
00:05:57.420 get
00:05:57.510 a
00:05:57.570 little

00:05:57.750 more
00:05:57.930 interesting
00:05:58.470 a
00:05:58.560 little
00:05:58.680 more
00:05:58.920 mild

00:05:59.190 flavor
00:05:59.580 but
00:06:00.330 yet
00:06:00.450 it
00:06:00.570 still
00:06:00.600 has
00:06:00.840 enough
00:06:00.870 of

00:06:01.200 that
00:06:01.290 bitter
00:06:01.500 celery
00:06:01.920 flavor
00:06:02.250 to
00:06:02.700 bring
00:06:02.910 out

00:06:03.000 the
00:06:03.150 sweetness
00:06:03.450 in
00:06:03.720 the
00:06:03.810 other
00:06:03.930 fruit
00:06:04.230 which

00:06:05.010 really
00:06:05.220 is
00:06:05.370 what
00:06:05.520 makes
00:06:05.550 the
00:06:05.790 salad
00:06:05.970 so

00:06:06.240 delicious
00:06:06.660 but
00:06:07.560 anyway
00:06:07.830 that's
00:06:07.950 it
00:06:08.190 my
00:06:08.400 take

00:06:08.640 on

00:06:11.760 by
00:06:11.970 the
