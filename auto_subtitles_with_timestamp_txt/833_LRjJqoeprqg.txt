00:05:23.199 them
00:05:23.379 hey
00:05:23.529 listen
00:05:23.680 cut
00:05:24.370 my
00:05:24.550 ham
00:05:24.909 a
00:05:24.939 little
00:05:25.090 bit

00:05:25.270 thinner
00:05:25.479 because
00:05:26.199 I
00:05:26.289 don't
00:05:26.469 like
00:05:26.650 it
00:05:26.830 to
00:05:26.949 be

00:05:27.039 too
00:05:27.250 thin
00:05:27.550 even
00:05:27.849 though
00:05:27.939 I'm
00:05:28.029 using
00:05:28.210 a
00:05:28.360 couple

00:05:28.539 of
00:05:28.659 slices
00:05:28.840 I
00:05:29.289 really
00:05:29.889 do
00:05:30.069 feel
00:05:30.099 like
00:05:30.340 the

00:05:30.610 flavor
00:05:30.879 is
00:05:31.090 better
00:05:31.360 if
00:05:31.599 it's
00:05:31.750 thinner
00:05:32.080 and

00:05:32.289 just
00:05:32.469 put
00:05:32.620 a
00:05:32.650 couple
00:05:32.770 more
00:05:32.919 slices
00:05:33.279 on
00:05:33.520 there

00:05:33.699 that
00:05:33.849 you
00:05:33.879 two
00:05:34.150 originally
00:05:34.539 thought
00:05:34.659 you
00:05:34.779 were

00:05:34.870 going
00:05:34.990 to
00:05:35.080 use
00:05:35.250 hope
00:05:36.250 that
00:05:36.400 make
00:05:36.520 sense
00:05:36.870 and

00:05:37.870 then
00:05:38.080 I'm
00:05:38.169 going
00:05:38.319 to
00:05:38.349 put
00:05:38.610 the
00:05:39.610 other
00:05:39.759 slice
00:05:40.089 of

00:05:40.120 cheese
00:05:40.479 on
00:05:40.629 the
00:05:40.719 top

00:05:53.379 gotten
