00:00:05.590 it's
00:00:06.130 basically
00:00:06.550 called

00:00:06.790 bangers
00:00:07.330 and
00:00:07.599 mash

00:00:13.419 little

00:00:13.539 bit
00:00:13.690 of

00:00:18.400 your
00:00:18.580 potato
00:00:19.170 some
00:00:20.170 are
00:00:20.320 better
00:00:20.440 for
00:00:20.680 mashing

00:00:21.100 than
00:00:21.250 others
00:00:21.580 but
00:00:21.850 generally
00:00:22.600 you
00:00:22.720 can
00:00:22.990 use

00:00:23.350 pretty
00:00:23.710 much
00:00:24.010 most
00:00:24.310 potatoes
00:00:24.640 have
00:00:25.540 a
00:00:25.600 look
00:00:25.780 on

00:00:25.930 the
00:00:26.020 packet
00:00:26.410 if
00:00:26.500 you're
00:00:26.650 unsure
00:00:26.830 some
00:00:27.760 say

00:00:28.030 they're
00:00:28.210 for
00:00:28.390 mashing
00:00:28.720 and

00:00:32.469 what
00:00:32.649 we

00:00:35.200 throughout
00:00:36.070 the
00:00:36.310 potato
00:00:36.640 so
00:00:36.880 you

00:00:37.120 don't
00:00:37.270 get
00:00:37.360 these
00:00:37.450 lumpy
00:00:37.840 bits
00:00:38.020 now
00:00:38.710 one
00:00:38.980 way

00:00:39.160 of
00:00:39.190 ensuring
00:00:39.880 that
00:00:39.910 it's
00:00:40.239 just
00:00:40.390 pick
00:00:40.930 the

00:00:41.050 middle
00:00:41.170 and

00:00:42.280 that
00:00:42.400 up
00:00:42.520 like
00:00:42.700 so

00:00:43.239 again
00:00:43.540 same
00:00:43.870 on
00:00:44.050 that
00:00:44.079 one
00:00:44.350 do
00:00:44.829 it
00:00:44.950 in
00:00:45.040 the

00:00:45.100 middle
00:00:45.220 for
00:00:46.210 all
00:00:46.300 of
00:00:46.450 those
00:00:46.570 whoops
00:00:47.079 didn't

00:00:47.440 quite
00:00:47.590 do
00:00:47.710 that
00:00:47.770 in
00:00:47.980 the
00:00:48.070 middle
00:00:48.160 and
00:00:48.370 in
00:00:48.430 mine

00:00:49.050 so
00:00:50.050 what
00:00:50.170 I'm
00:00:50.290 going
00:00:50.380 to
00:00:50.440 do
00:00:50.560 is
00:00:50.710 I'm
00:00:50.950 going
00:00:51.010 to

00:00:51.160 chop
00:00:51.310 them
00:00:51.460 up
00:00:51.489 many
00:00:51.700 more
00:00:51.880 than
00:00:52.000 that

00:00:52.239 otherwise
00:00:52.780 it
00:00:53.079 was
00:00:53.170 all
00:00:53.260 too
00:00:53.500 much
00:00:53.680 water
00:00:53.950 so

00:00:54.190 chop
00:00:54.760 them
00:00:54.880 down
00:00:54.910 the
00:00:55.120 middle
00:00:55.300 pop
00:00:55.870 them
00:00:55.960 in

00:00:56.050 the
00:00:56.140 pan
00:00:56.350 and
00:00:56.680 then
00:00:57.010 we're
00:00:57.190 going
00:00:57.309 to
00:00:57.370 boil

00:00:58.000 them
00:00:58.210 for
00:00:58.390 a
00:00:58.480 slowly
00:00:59.140 boiling
00:00:59.649 for
00:00:59.800 about

00:00:59.890 15-20
00:01:00.520 minutes
00:01:01.090 probably
00:01:01.180 about
00:01:01.480 20
00:01:01.750 minutes

00:01:02.050 okay
00:01:02.500 now
00:01:02.710 for
00:01:02.800 the
00:01:02.980 cooking
00:01:03.190 I'll
00:01:03.550 boil
00:01:04.030 the

00:01:04.269 kettle
00:01:04.420 got
00:01:04.930 some
00:01:05.110 hot
00:01:05.229 water
00:01:05.379 in
00:01:05.619 there
00:01:06.180 saves

00:01:07.180 a
00:01:07.299 bit
00:01:07.420 of
00:01:07.540 time
00:01:07.950 so
00:01:08.950 we're
00:01:09.070 just
00:01:09.100 going
00:01:09.310 to

00:01:09.400 fill
00:01:09.580 that
00:01:10.890 little
00:01:11.890 bit
00:01:12.340 over
00:01:12.460 the
00:01:12.580 side
00:01:12.729 there

00:01:13.229 put
00:01:14.229 some
00:01:14.380 solving
00:01:14.860 I
00:01:15.040 think
00:01:15.520 it
00:01:15.610 helps
00:01:15.820 to

00:01:15.909 break
00:01:16.060 down
00:01:16.270 a
00:01:16.330 potato
00:01:16.720 and
00:01:16.900 adds
00:01:17.020 a
00:01:17.110 little

00:01:17.260 bit
00:01:17.350 to
00:01:17.590 the
00:01:17.680 flavor
00:01:17.950 so
00:01:18.430 put
00:01:19.420 that
00:01:19.570 and
00:01:19.659 we're

00:01:19.750 going
00:01:19.840 to
00:01:19.930 tip
00:01:20.080 the
00:01:20.170 water
00:01:20.380 away
00:01:20.500 so
00:01:20.680 that's

00:01:22.380 pop
00:01:23.380 the
00:01:23.500 lid
00:01:23.650 on
00:01:23.799 turn
00:01:24.280 the
00:01:24.430 heat
00:01:24.580 on
00:01:24.610 and

00:01:25.330 we're
00:01:25.479 going
00:01:25.600 to
00:01:25.630 cook
00:01:25.840 it
00:01:26.049 simmer
00:01:26.770 over
00:01:27.190 sized

00:01:27.400 or
00:01:27.670 middle
00:01:28.060 heat
00:01:28.270 for
00:01:29.110 about
00:01:29.290 15
00:01:29.770 minutes

00:01:30.100 while
00:01:30.549 we're
00:01:30.790 cooking
00:01:30.909 the
00:01:31.240 potatoes
00:01:31.900 in
00:01:32.020 the

00:01:32.110 back
00:01:32.229 that
00:01:32.439 I've
00:01:32.500 moved
00:01:32.740 into
00:01:32.830 the
00:01:33.010 bag
00:01:33.189 we're

00:01:34.060 just
00:01:34.210 going
00:01:34.390 to
00:01:34.450 put
00:01:34.600 in
00:01:34.750 the
00:01:34.960 sausages
00:01:35.799 try

00:01:36.400 and
00:01:36.549 pick
00:01:36.760 really
00:01:37.090 nice
00:01:37.450 sausages
00:01:38.020 because

00:01:38.409 you
00:01:39.070 know
00:01:39.189 in
00:01:39.460 the
00:01:39.580 day
00:01:39.729 is
00:01:39.970 half
00:01:40.450 the
00:01:40.720 meal

00:01:40.900 really
00:01:41.170 the
00:01:41.320 sausages
00:01:41.799 so
00:01:42.130 try
00:01:42.460 and
00:01:42.580 pick
00:01:42.729 the

00:01:42.850 good
00:01:42.970 ones
00:01:43.270 getting
00:01:43.900 from
00:01:44.049 the
00:01:44.140 butchers
00:01:44.619 or

00:01:44.860 you
00:01:45.640 know
00:01:45.759 there's
00:01:46.000 various
00:01:46.450 mates
00:01:46.689 out
00:01:46.960 there

00:01:47.170 that
00:01:47.409 are
00:01:47.530 really
00:01:47.830 nice
00:01:48.130 just

00:01:48.970 what
00:01:49.119 do

00:01:49.180 you
00:01:49.240 want
00:01:49.420 so
00:01:49.659 popping
00:01:50.350 in
00:01:50.560 the
00:01:50.770 oil
00:01:51.240 obviously

00:01:52.240 you
00:01:52.330 can
00:01:52.570 grill
00:01:52.930 these
00:01:53.140 if
00:01:53.409 you're
00:01:53.560 a
00:01:53.590 little

00:01:53.710 bit
00:01:53.950 more
00:01:54.390 health-conscious
00:01:55.390 you
00:01:55.750 haven't

00:01:55.990 got

00:01:57.700 know
00:01:57.729 fry
00:01:58.119 them

00:01:59.070 it's

00:02:00.070 probably
00:02:00.369 easier
00:02:00.759 so

00:02:06.430 outside
00:02:07.140 they're
00:02:08.140 probably

00:02:55.870 done
00:02:55.989 these
00:02:56.500 are
00:02:56.530 clearly

00:02:57.099 done
00:02:57.370 ten

00:02:58.209 minute
00:02:58.480 mark
00:02:58.659 probably
00:02:59.590 another
00:02:59.859 10
00:03:00.159 minutes

00:03:00.489 outside

00:03:01.510 check
00:03:01.810 them
00:03:01.930 just

00:03:02.200 before
00:03:02.349 then
00:03:02.769 okay
00:03:03.400 we're
00:03:03.609 at
00:03:03.670 the
00:03:03.730 15
00:03:04.209 minute

00:03:04.540 mark
00:03:04.569 now
00:03:04.989 I'm
00:03:05.260 just
00:03:05.500 going
00:03:05.680 to
00:03:05.709 check
00:03:05.980 these

00:03:06.129 potatoes
00:03:06.790 yeah
00:03:07.690 they're
00:03:07.900 just
00:03:08.139 slightly

00:03:08.590 falling
00:03:09.250 off
00:03:09.430 what
00:03:10.180 you
00:03:10.299 want
00:03:10.480 to
00:03:10.569 do
00:03:10.720 with
00:03:10.900 the

00:03:10.989 players
00:03:11.440 is
00:03:11.650 slightly
00:03:12.280 overcook
00:03:13.209 them
00:03:13.480 rather

00:03:13.930 than
00:03:14.109 undercook
00:03:14.709 them
00:03:14.889 otherwise
00:03:15.250 you
00:03:15.430 get

00:03:15.549 the
00:03:15.670 lump
00:03:15.909 so
00:03:16.239 five
00:03:17.079 more
00:03:17.410 minutes
00:03:17.620 so
00:03:18.010 20

00:03:18.370 minutes
00:03:18.639 for
00:03:18.790 the
00:03:18.879 potatoes
00:03:19.419 and
00:03:19.629 I
00:03:19.750 think

00:03:19.989 we're
00:03:20.139 done
00:03:20.349 and
00:03:20.590 then
00:03:20.680 we're
00:03:20.829 going
00:03:20.949 out
00:03:21.040 the

00:03:21.160 perfect
00:03:21.400 mash
00:03:21.790 okay
00:03:22.750 we're
00:03:22.959 at
00:03:22.989 the
00:03:23.079 20
00:03:23.410 minute

00:03:23.650 stage
00:03:23.940 and
00:03:24.940 I
00:03:25.000 think
00:03:25.269 the
00:03:25.329 potatoes
00:03:25.720 are
00:03:25.870 done

00:03:25.989 now
00:03:26.230 so
00:03:26.500 we're
00:03:26.650 just
00:03:26.799 going
00:03:26.949 to
00:03:27.040 check
00:03:27.220 that
00:03:27.430 if

00:03:27.609 you
00:03:27.699 put
00:03:27.879 the
00:03:27.970 knife
00:03:28.150 in

00:03:28.690 they
00:03:29.470 definitely
00:03:30.069 fall
00:03:30.340 off
00:03:30.549 if
00:03:30.970 they're

00:03:31.180 hesitant
00:03:31.599 they're
00:03:32.230 not
00:03:32.410 quite
00:03:32.680 done
00:03:32.949 so
00:03:33.549 what

00:03:33.699 I'm
00:03:33.819 now
00:03:34.000 going
00:03:34.209 to

00:03:36.099 possible
00:03:36.549 I'm
00:03:37.030 probably
00:03:37.329 going

00:03:37.510 to

00:03:40.299 not
00:03:40.419 going
00:03:40.540 to

00:03:40.599 use
00:03:40.720 that

00:04:45.750 bit
00:04:45.900 on

00:04:53.850 things
00:04:54.720 out
00:04:54.930 now
00:04:55.290 the

00:04:55.350 important
00:04:55.860 thing
00:04:55.890 is
00:04:56.160 when
00:04:56.400 you're
00:04:56.550 mixing
00:04:56.700 my

00:04:57.060 place
00:04:57.450 though
00:04:57.660 you
00:04:58.140 don't
00:04:58.380 want
00:04:58.470 to

00:04:59.370 mix
00:04:59.610 and
00:04:59.790 mixing

00:05:00.450 otherwise
00:05:01.290 it
00:05:01.530 ends
