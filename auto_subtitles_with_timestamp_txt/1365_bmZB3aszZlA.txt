00:00:34.260 salt
00:00:34.320 and

00:00:34.800 pepper
00:00:35.130 then
00:00:35.940 I
00:00:35.969 threw
00:00:36.270 in
00:00:36.390 the
00:00:36.510 fresh
00:00:36.780 basil

00:00:38.760 for
00:00:39.239 more
00:00:39.450 than

00:00:40.500 seconds
00:00:40.950 garlic
00:00:41.610 burns
00:00:41.790 extremely

00:00:42.270 quickly
00:00:42.510 I
00:00:43.489 like
00:00:44.489 to
00:00:44.640 use
00:00:44.789 one
00:00:45.090 can

00:00:47.579 can

00:00:50.039 of
00:00:50.280 crushed
00:00:50.550 tomatoes

00:00:51.090 but
00:00:51.660 I
00:00:51.719 do
00:00:51.840 like
00:00:52.170 the
00:00:52.350 sauce
00:00:52.559 to
00:00:52.770 be

00:00:52.920 little

00:00:53.190 bit
00:00:53.309 chunky
00:00:53.520 and
00:00:53.910 you
00:00:54.390 won't
00:00:54.600 get
00:00:54.719 a
00:00:54.780 chunky

00:00:55.170 sauce
00:00:55.440 from
00:00:55.680 a
00:00:55.800 can
00:00:55.829 of
00:00:56.219 crushed
00:00:56.489 tomatoes

00:00:58.410 cup
00:00:58.710 of
00:00:58.739 water
00:00:59.070 to

00:00:59.250 loosen
00:00:59.699 it
00:00:59.760 up
00:00:59.879 a
00:01:00.030 bit

00:01:00.239 I
00:01:00.420 took
00:01:00.780 a
00:01:01.020 potato
00:01:01.410 masher
00:01:01.680 or
00:01:02.280 in
00:01:02.430 this
00:01:02.520 case
00:01:02.789 a

00:01:03.090 tomato
00:01:03.690 masher
00:01:04.170 and
00:01:04.320 I
00:01:04.860 mashed
00:01:05.159 up
00:01:05.369 those

00:01:05.580 tomatoes
00:01:06.320 even
00:01:07.320 though
00:01:07.470 you
00:01:07.530 mash
00:01:07.830 the

00:01:08.070 tomatoes
00:01:08.100 you're
00:01:08.729 still
00:01:09.000 going
00:01:09.240 to
00:01:09.360 have

00:01:09.510 little
00:01:09.780 chunks
00:01:10.110 of
00:01:10.350 tomatoes
00:01:10.799 floating

00:01:11.280 around
00:01:11.430 your
00:01:11.700 sauce
00:01:12.000 and
00:01:12.299 that's
00:01:12.840 what
00:01:13.020 I
00:01:13.049 love

00:01:13.350 ironically
00:01:14.250 I
00:01:14.460 hated
00:01:14.790 those
00:01:15.060 chunks
00:01:15.479 of

00:01:15.600 tomatoes
00:01:15.990 in
00:01:16.140 my
00:01:16.170 sauce
00:01:16.530 when
00:01:16.770 I
00:01:16.799 was
00:01:17.009 a
00:01:17.040 kid
00:01:17.340 I

00:01:17.520 also
00:01:18.180 hated
00:01:18.630 fruit
00:01:18.900 chunks
00:01:19.200 in
00:01:19.409 my
00:01:19.439 yogurt
00:01:19.890 as

00:01:20.009 a
00:01:20.040 kid
00:01:20.310 things
00:01:20.970 really
00:01:21.240 change
00:01:21.600 when
00:01:21.780 you
00:01:21.840 get

00:01:21.990 older
00:01:22.259 though
00:01:22.439 i
00:01:22.820 season
00:01:23.820 them
00:01:23.970 with
00:01:24.000 salt

00:01:24.509 pepper
00:01:25.200 oregano
00:01:25.860 and
00:01:26.340 a
00:01:26.460 little
00:01:26.729 bit
00:01:26.880 of
00:01:27.030 sugar

00:01:27.470 tomatoes
00:01:28.470 can
00:01:28.710 be
00:01:28.829 a
00:01:28.860 bit
00:01:29.130 sour
00:01:29.520 and
00:01:29.909 the
00:01:29.939 sugar

00:01:30.270 will
00:01:30.509 help
00:01:30.750 with
00:01:30.900 that
00:01:30.930 some
00:01:31.710 people

00:01:32.009 recommend
00:01:32.159 adding
00:01:32.640 half
00:01:33.090 of
00:01:33.240 a
00:01:33.360 grated
00:01:33.780 carrot

00:01:34.290 carrots
00:01:35.130 are
00:01:35.250 sweet
00:01:35.610 but
00:01:35.850 sugar
00:01:36.299 works
00:01:36.630 for
00:01:36.930 me

00:01:37.079 I
00:01:37.320 really
00:01:38.280 tried
00:01:38.490 looking
00:01:38.610 for
00:01:38.939 the
00:01:39.000 lid
00:01:39.180 of

00:01:39.270 this
00:01:39.420 pan
00:01:39.689 I
00:01:39.869 couldn't
00:01:40.170 find
00:01:40.320 it
00:01:40.500 so
00:01:40.530 I
00:01:40.680 use

00:01:40.829 aluminum
00:01:41.369 foil
00:01:41.729 and
00:01:41.970 then
00:01:42.630 I
00:01:42.780 lowered
00:01:43.110 the

00:01:43.259 heat
00:01:43.500 to
00:01:43.740 medium
00:01:44.070 low
00:01:44.689 so
00:01:45.689 while
00:01:45.899 the
00:01:46.049 sauce

00:01:46.290 was
00:01:46.530 simmering
00:01:46.740 I
00:01:47.070 started
00:01:47.399 making
00:01:47.520 my

00:01:48.360 I
00:01:48.479 used
00:01:49.020 a
00:01:49.170 blend
00:01:49.470 of
00:01:49.649 beef
00:01:49.979 pork
00:01:50.430 and
00:01:50.729 veal
00:01:50.880 I

00:01:51.409 broke
00:01:52.409 it
00:01:52.560 up
00:01:52.619 with
00:01:52.799 my
00:01:52.920 fingers
00:01:53.340 you
00:01:53.610 may
00:01:53.759 use

00:01:53.909 a
00:01:54.060 fork
00:01:54.360 if
00:01:54.540 you
00:01:55.110 don't
00:01:55.350 want
00:01:55.470 to
00:01:55.590 use
00:01:55.710 a
00:01:55.740 blend

00:01:56.130 of
00:01:56.310 beef
00:01:56.640 pork
00:01:56.909 and
00:01:57.119 veal
00:01:57.240 you
00:01:57.299 can
00:01:57.689 use
00:01:58.259 beef

00:01:58.619 by
00:01:58.829 itself
00:01:59.189 and
00:01:59.430 they
00:01:59.850 will
00:02:00.030 be
00:02:00.180 delicious
00:02:00.479 as

00:02:00.780 well
00:02:01.049 here
00:02:01.860 I
00:02:01.890 have
00:02:02.189 one
00:02:02.430 slice
00:02:02.700 of
00:02:02.729 bread
00:02:02.969 that

00:02:03.479 I
00:02:03.509 placed
00:02:03.869 in
00:02:04.049 my
00:02:04.170 food
00:02:04.380 processor

00:02:05.870 I
00:02:05.900 added
00:02:06.260 it
00:02:06.560 to
00:02:06.590 my
00:02:06.770 beast
00:02:07.160 you
00:02:07.700 can
00:02:07.880 just

00:02:08.030 break
00:02:08.119 it
00:02:08.300 up
00:02:08.390 with
00:02:08.510 your
00:02:08.660 fingers
00:02:09.080 I
00:02:09.320 threw
00:02:10.100 in

00:02:10.190 some
00:02:10.220 parsley
00:02:11.030 fresh
00:02:11.540 garlic
00:02:12.110 I
00:02:12.320 didn't
00:02:12.890 use

00:02:13.700 since
00:02:13.940 the
00:02:14.150 sauce
00:02:14.390 already
00:02:14.690 has
00:02:15.020 onions
00:02:15.530 I

00:02:15.800 know
00:02:16.370 it
00:02:16.550 has
00:02:16.670 garlic
00:02:16.940 too
00:02:17.270 but
00:02:17.690 you
00:02:17.750 can
00:02:17.870 never

00:02:17.990 have
00:02:18.200 enough
00:02:18.440 garlic
00:02:18.770 an
00:02:18.980 egg
00:02:19.910 some
00:02:20.480 milk
00:02:20.810 to

00:02:21.290 moisten
00:02:21.500 things
00:02:21.980 up
00:02:22.220 a
00:02:22.250 bit
00:02:22.340 a
00:02:22.670 little
00:02:23.510 bit
00:02:23.600 of

00:02:23.750 chili
00:02:24.020 powder
00:02:24.170 I
00:02:24.710 like
00:02:25.220 the
00:02:25.370 kick
00:02:25.640 it
00:02:25.760 gives

00:02:26.170 lots
00:02:27.170 of
00:02:27.350 Parmesan
00:02:27.890 cheese
00:02:27.920 and

00:02:30.800 salt
00:02:31.100 and
00:02:31.340 pepper

00:02:31.400 and
00:02:31.970 now
00:02:32.960 I
00:02:32.990 did
00:02:33.290 mention
00:02:33.530 earlier
00:02:33.890 that

00:02:34.250 spaghetti
00:02:34.640 and
00:02:34.790 meatballs
00:02:35.180 was
00:02:35.510 my

00:04:14.750 enough
00:04:14.959 alright
00:04:15.620 so

00:04:15.859 placed
00:04:16.220 a
00:04:16.400 spaghetti
00:04:16.670 into
00:04:17.209 my

00:04:22.650 onto

00:04:23.280 pasta
00:04:23.790 and
00:04:23.970 they
00:04:24.600 don't

00:04:24.750 completely
00:04:25.110 drain
00:04:25.500 the
00:04:25.650 pasta
00:04:25.800 so
00:04:26.520 I
00:04:26.550 like
00:04:26.760 to

00:04:26.790 mix
00:04:27.060 the
00:04:27.330 pasta
00:04:27.480 with
00:04:27.870 the

00:04:29.790 I
00:04:30.030 just

00:04:30.360 don't
00:04:30.930 prefer
00:04:31.290 it
00:04:31.320 watery
00:04:32.070 so
00:04:32.760 this
00:04:33.090 is
00:04:33.240 how
00:04:33.360 I

00:04:33.390 served
00:04:33.810 it
00:04:34.050 it
00:04:34.200 was
00:04:34.290 completely
00:04:35.190 drenched
00:04:35.670 in

00:04:35.790 the
00:04:35.940 sauce
00:04:36.120 which
00:04:36.360 I
00:04:36.510 loved
00:04:36.720 and
00:04:37.020 it
00:04:37.680 was
00:04:37.800 a
00:04:37.830 bit

00:04:38.010 messy
00:04:38.130 but
00:04:38.430 I
00:04:38.460 cleaned
00:04:38.760 it
00:04:38.820 off
00:04:38.970 later
00:04:39.270 I
00:04:39.540 like

00:04:40.530 to
00:04:40.680 serve
00:04:40.860 three
00:04:41.250 to
00:04:41.340 four
00:04:41.580 meatballs
00:04:42.000 per

00:04:42.210 person
00:04:42.630 but
00:04:42.900 of
00:04:43.050 course
00:04:43.260 it
00:04:43.440 all
00:04:43.530 depends
00:04:43.860 on

00:04:44.010 the
00:04:44.130 actual
00:04:44.670 person
00:04:45.180 my
00:04:45.720 brother
00:04:45.990 prefers
00:04:46.410 six

00:04:46.710 to
00:04:46.950 seven
00:04:47.310 meatballs
00:04:47.490 so
00:04:48.390 then
00:04:48.540 I
00:04:48.570 just

00:04:48.660 subtract
00:04:49.200 meatballs
00:04:49.650 from
00:04:49.860 his
00:04:50.160 girlfriend's

00:04:50.820 plate
00:04:51.060 just
00:04:51.600 kidding
00:04:51.900 I
00:04:52.050 grated
00:04:52.740 some

00:04:53.130 parmesan
00:04:53.610 on
00:04:53.640 top
00:04:54.020 so
00:04:55.020 this
00:04:55.260 in
00:04:55.440 total
00:04:55.770 should

00:04:55.980 take
00:04:56.160 about
00:04:56.280 45
00:04:56.940 minutes
00:04:57.270 to
00:04:57.600 make
00:04:57.780 but
00:04:58.020 it's

00:04:58.140 so
00:04:58.470 worth
00:04:58.740 it
00:04:58.920 the
00:04:59.430 kids
00:04:59.700 will
00:04:59.880 love
00:05:00.030 it
00:05:00.210 you

00:05:01.260 place
00:05:01.860 two
00:05:01.890 basil
00:05:02.670 leaves
00:05:02.850 on

00:05:03.060 top
00:05:03.270 to
00:05:03.660 make
00:05:03.810 it
00:05:03.870 look
