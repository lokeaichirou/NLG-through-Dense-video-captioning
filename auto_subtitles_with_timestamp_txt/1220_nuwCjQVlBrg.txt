00:03:28.450 breakfast
00:03:28.810 in
00:03:28.959 my
00:03:29.140 life
00:03:29.380 before
00:03:29.650 so
00:03:30.489 a

00:03:30.820 little
00:03:31.150 thing
00:03:31.299 is
00:03:31.450 two
00:03:31.720 eggs
00:03:32.049 some
00:03:32.560 say
00:03:32.739 3

00:03:33.040 since
00:03:33.220 the
00:03:33.430 large
00:03:33.670 pot
00:03:34.150 in
00:03:34.359 the
00:03:34.420 news
00:03:34.630 3
00:03:42.269 okay

00:03:43.269 we

00:03:43.900 the
00:03:43.959 veal
00:03:44.079 cutlets
00:03:44.530 frankly

00:03:45.130 super
00:03:45.640 rough
00:03:45.790 and
00:03:45.970 mixing
00:03:46.299 the
00:03:46.359 babies
00:03:46.709 inner

00:03:47.709 sense
00:03:47.980 a
00:03:48.040 little
00:03:48.100 but
00:03:48.760 the
00:03:49.600 only
00:03:49.780 bill
00:03:49.930 cutlets

00:03:50.290 we
00:03:50.410 could
00:03:50.560 find

00:03:54.670 the

00:03:54.820 pork
00:03:54.850 chops
00:03:55.209 so
00:03:55.540 we

00:03:55.810 have
00:03:55.870 to

00:03:57.370 pretty
00:03:57.609 thin
00:03:57.790 so
00:03:58.120 that

00:03:58.840 out
00:03:58.930 for
00:03:59.079 us
00:03:59.170 cuz
