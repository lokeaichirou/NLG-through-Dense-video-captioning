00:00:00.060 I'm
00:00:00.269 a
00:00:00.329 big
00:00:00.719 fan
00:00:01.230 of
00:00:01.500 eating
00:00:01.920 hummus
00:00:02.129 as
00:00:02.429 a

00:00:02.490 snack
00:00:02.879 at
00:00:03.179 home
00:00:03.480 and
00:00:03.780 I
00:00:04.080 would
00:00:04.259 say
00:00:04.440 that
00:00:04.620 I'm

00:00:04.710 about
00:00:04.950 equally
00:00:05.700 divided
00:00:06.270 between
00:00:06.299 buying

00:00:07.140 hummus
00:00:07.649 and
00:00:07.950 making
00:00:08.460 it
00:00:08.580 myself

00:00:09.330 I
00:00:09.360 personally
00:00:10.139 like
00:00:10.650 the
00:00:10.769 stuff
00:00:10.980 I
00:00:11.099 make

00:00:11.250 better
00:00:11.490 and
00:00:11.759 my
00:00:12.630 kids

00:00:13.200 I
00:00:13.349 took
00:00:13.889 a
00:00:14.099 little
00:00:14.309 embarrassing
00:00:14.880 to
00:00:14.969 say
00:00:15.120 this

00:00:15.269 but
00:00:15.450 I
00:00:15.509 think
00:00:15.660 they
00:00:15.960 like
00:00:16.170 the
00:00:16.199 store-bought

00:00:16.859 better
00:00:17.930 anyway
00:00:18.930 I
00:00:19.170 think
00:00:19.470 it's
00:00:19.800 better
00:00:19.949 to

00:00:20.039 make
00:00:20.250 it
00:00:20.369 yourself
00:00:20.490 and
00:00:20.970 you're
00:00:21.150 definitely

00:00:21.420 going
00:00:21.810 to
00:00:21.840 save
00:00:22.020 some
00:00:22.230 money
00:00:22.320 if
00:00:22.560 you
00:00:22.650 do
00:00:22.830 it
00:00:23.010 so

00:00:23.580 why
00:00:24.150 not
00:00:24.300 give
00:00:24.539 it
00:00:24.660 a
00:00:24.720 try
00:00:24.750 the
00:00:25.650 first
00:00:25.859 thing

00:00:26.010 you
00:00:26.099 want
00:00:26.250 to
00:00:26.310 do
00:00:26.460 is
00:00:26.670 chop
00:00:27.029 your
00:00:27.390 garlic
00:00:27.590 turn

00:00:28.590 the
00:00:28.710 processor
00:00:28.859 on
00:00:29.310 and
00:00:29.490 then
00:00:29.670 drop
00:00:30.090 the

00:00:30.300 cloves
00:00:30.710 through
00:00:31.710 the
00:00:31.890 feed
00:00:32.099 tube
00:00:32.430 it
00:00:32.820 works
00:00:33.090 so

00:00:33.300 much
00:00:33.450 better
00:00:33.660 than
00:00:33.809 if
00:00:33.930 you
00:00:33.960 put
00:00:34.050 them
00:00:34.500 in
00:00:34.710 and

00:00:34.950 then
00:00:35.040 turn
00:00:35.309 the
00:00:35.520 machine
00:00:35.820 on
00:00:35.960 I'm
00:00:36.960 not
00:00:37.200 sure

00:00:37.559 about
00:00:37.980 the
00:00:38.340 scientific
00:00:39.000 reason
00:00:39.180 for
00:00:39.329 that
00:00:39.600 but

00:00:39.840 it
00:00:40.620 definitely
00:00:41.160 does
00:00:41.309 it
00:00:41.489 gets
00:00:41.640 nice
00:00:42.180 and

00:00:42.239 finely
00:00:42.780 ground
00:00:43.140 you
00:00:43.320 don't
00:00:43.350 have
00:00:43.620 to
00:00:43.739 top
00:00:43.950 it

00:00:44.129 yourself
00:00:44.489 and
00:00:45.300 then
00:00:46.230 to
00:00:46.440 that
00:00:46.559 you're
00:00:46.800 going

00:00:50.910 been
