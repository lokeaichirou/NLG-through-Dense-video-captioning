00:00:44.760 do
00:00:44.850 that

00:00:45.000 we'll
00:00:45.180 cut
00:00:45.360 it
00:00:45.450 in
00:00:45.539 half
00:00:45.780 and
00:00:46.320 by
00:00:46.410 the
00:00:46.469 way
00:00:46.620 if

00:00:46.710 the
00:00:46.770 potato
00:00:47.070 tapers
00:00:47.489 a
00:00:47.520 little
00:00:47.789 bit
00:00:47.940 I
00:00:48.059 always

00:00:48.239 cut
00:00:48.420 the
00:00:48.539 tapered
00:00:48.899 end

00:00:49.140 little
00:00:49.320 longer
00:00:49.710 see

00:00:51.539 half
00:00:51.690 all

00:00:52.079 right
00:00:52.199 that'll
00:00:52.440 compensate
00:00:52.890 a
00:00:52.920 little
00:00:52.980 bit

00:00:53.219 for
00:00:53.309 the
00:00:53.520 difference
00:00:53.910 in
00:00:54.030 girth
00:00:54.300 so
00:00:54.660 we'll

00:00:54.899 them
00:00:54.989 in
00:00:55.079 half

00:00:55.829 halves
00:00:56.129 in

00:00:56.370 half
00:00:56.399 and
00:00:57.149 that's
00:00:57.270 a
00:00:57.360 pretty
00:00:57.539 good
00:00:57.600 method
00:00:57.989 for

00:00:58.020 getting
00:00:58.350 even
00:00:58.440 sized
00:00:58.739 pieces

00:01:01.050 video
00:01:01.260 we
00:01:01.410 cut

00:01:01.590 them
00:01:01.680 in
00:01:01.770 half
00:01:01.920 lengthwise

00:01:11.159 my
00:01:11.189 potatoes
00:01:11.580 once
00:01:11.790 because
00:01:12.510 you
00:01:12.540 have
00:01:12.750 to

00:01:12.840 rinse
00:01:13.049 the
00:01:13.200 starch
00:01:13.439 off

00:01:16.049 you
00:01:16.140 peel
00:01:16.380 them
00:01:16.530 that's
00:01:16.890 like
00:01:17.040 double
00:01:17.159 in
00:01:17.369 your

00:01:31.860 bring
00:01:31.950 that

00:01:32.009 up
00:01:32.220 to
00:01:32.340 a
00:01:32.369 boil

00:01:32.939 highest
00:01:33.270 heat

00:01:33.420 possible
00:01:33.990 and
00:01:34.320 then
00:01:34.740 we'll
00:01:34.890 adjust
00:01:35.100 our
00:01:35.250 heat

00:01:35.460 to
00:01:35.579 maintain
00:01:35.729 a
00:01:35.970 nice
00:01:36.180 steady
00:01:36.479 simmer
00:01:36.840 and

00:01:37.140 we'll
00:01:37.470 cook
00:01:37.650 these
00:01:37.770 until
00:01:37.829 perfectly
00:01:38.670 tender

00:01:39.119 and
00:01:39.329 since
00:01:39.810 that's
00:01:39.960 gonna
00:01:40.140 take
00:01:40.380 a
00:01:40.409 little

00:01:40.560 while
00:01:40.829 we
00:01:41.040 can
00:01:41.070 go
00:01:41.310 ahead
00:01:41.400 and
00:01:41.670 prep
00:01:41.909 our

00:01:42.060 butter
00:01:42.299 and
00:01:42.630 I
00:01:43.049 hope
00:01:43.229 you're
00:01:43.380 sitting
00:01:43.530 down

00:01:43.790 because
00:01:44.790 that's
00:01:44.909 how
00:01:45.090 much
00:01:45.240 we're
00:01:45.390 gonna
00:01:45.509 use

00:01:45.780 that
00:01:46.200 is
00:01:46.409 one
00:01:46.649 pound
00:01:47.009 of
00:01:47.340 European
00:01:48.090 butter

00:01:48.360 also
00:01:49.079 known
00:01:49.259 as
00:01:49.409 the
00:01:49.560 expensive
00:01:50.310 butter
00:01:50.520 but

00:01:51.060 it
00:01:51.180 is
00:01:51.299 gorgeous
00:01:51.540 very
00:01:52.049 low
00:01:52.200 water
00:01:52.409 content
00:01:52.770 it

00:01:53.579 almost
00:01:53.759 has
00:01:53.909 a
00:01:53.939 clay-like
00:01:54.299 texture
00:01:54.990 but

00:01:55.380 anyway
00:01:55.560 we're
00:01:55.680 gonna
00:01:55.740 take
00:01:56.040 a
00:01:56.070 pound
00:01:56.310 of

00:01:56.460 butter
00:01:56.520 we're
00:01:56.820 gonna
00:01:56.909 cut
00:01:57.149 it
00:01:57.240 up
00:01:57.360 in
00:01:57.509 chunks

00:01:57.750 and
00:01:58.170 it's
00:01:58.649 very
00:01:58.979 critical
00:01:59.549 this
00:01:59.729 butter
00:01:59.969 comes

00:02:00.240 up
00:02:00.390 to
00:02:00.509 room
00:02:00.689 temperature
00:02:00.960 it
00:02:01.469 would
00:02:01.560 be

00:02:01.649 perfect
00:02:02.130 if
00:02:02.250 this
00:02:02.399 butter
00:02:02.610 got
00:02:02.850 up

00:02:07.920 a
00:02:08.160 three-to-one
00:02:08.610 ratio

00:02:08.789 3

00:02:17.099 why
00:02:17.250 that's

00:02:17.430 not
00:02:17.700 only
00:02:17.879 not
00:02:18.209 insane
00:02:18.690 but
00:02:19.260 it
00:02:19.349 is
00:02:19.470 an

00:02:19.620 incredibly
00:02:20.129 rational
00:02:20.879 an
00:02:21.150 absolutely

00:02:21.930 reasonable
00:02:22.319 thing
00:02:22.920 to
00:02:22.950 do
00:02:23.220 so
00:02:23.790 please
00:02:24.000 check

00:02:24.150 that
00:02:24.209 out
00:02:24.480 especially
00:02:24.959 if
00:02:25.019 you're

00:02:25.170 fan
00:02:25.410 of

00:02:25.470 airtight
00:02:26.040 arguments

00:02:30.269 potatoes
00:02:30.390 and

00:02:31.049 we
00:02:31.530 really
00:02:31.890 want
00:02:32.069 these

00:02:35.069 knife
00:02:35.280 that
00:02:35.549 knife
00:02:35.790 should
00:02:36.030 go

00:02:36.150 in
00:02:36.330 with
00:02:36.360 almost
00:02:36.959 no
00:02:37.200 effort
00:02:37.379 I
00:02:37.799 mean
00:02:38.129 there's

00:02:38.310 just
00:02:38.370 nothing
00:02:38.640 more
00:02:38.940 evil
00:02:39.180 than
00:02:39.209 mashed

00:02:39.510 potatoes
00:02:39.930 with

00:03:12.000 first
00:03:12.180 phase
00:03:12.450 all
00:03:12.660 we're
00:03:12.780 doing

00:03:12.959 is

00:03:19.109 much
00:03:19.319 butter
00:03:19.530 in
00:03:19.590 the
00:03:19.739 recipe

00:03:20.069 you
00:03:20.280 don't
00:03:20.579 really
00:03:20.670 have
00:03:20.850 to
00:03:20.970 worry

00:03:45.720 room
00:03:45.900 temperature
00:03:46.349 and

00:03:46.560 once
00:03:47.010 that
00:03:47.160 first
00:03:47.370 addition
00:03:47.819 of
00:03:47.940 butter
00:03:48.120 is

00:03:48.239 mashed
00:03:48.510 in
00:03:48.810 we're
00:03:49.079 gonna
00:03:49.169 switch
00:03:49.560 to
00:03:49.769 a
00:03:49.799 wire

00:03:50.040 whisk
00:03:50.340 we're
00:03:50.970 gonna
00:03:51.060 dump
00:03:51.359 it
00:03:51.450 another

00:03:51.720 quarter
00:03:51.959 of

00:03:54.209 with
00:03:54.239 the
00:03:54.480 whisk
00:03:54.690 when
00:03:55.410 it
00:03:55.530 almost

00:03:55.769 disappears
00:03:55.980 at
00:03:56.609 the
00:03:56.760 next
00:03:57.000 quarter
00:03:57.269 of
00:03:57.419 butter

00:03:57.599 and
00:03:57.959 simply

00:04:01.349 way
00:04:01.440 this
00:04:01.590 is
00:04:01.650 almost
00:04:02.040 like

00:04:02.160 we're

00:04:02.519 a
00:04:02.579 butter
00:04:02.760 sauce
00:04:03.000 where
00:04:03.269 we're

00:04:03.389 mixing
00:04:03.690 in
00:04:03.780 the
00:04:03.870 butter
00:04:04.049 and
00:04:04.230 it's
00:04:04.380 kind
00:04:04.590 of

00:04:04.620 emulsifying
00:04:05.250 in
00:04:05.519 and
00:04:05.760 you'll
00:04:06.269 notice
00:04:06.450 when

00:04:06.599 you
00:04:06.690 get
00:04:06.780 down
00:04:06.930 to
00:04:07.019 that
00:04:07.079 last
00:04:07.319 addition

00:04:39.389 almost
00:04:39.600 perfect
00:04:39.990 but

00:04:40.110 it
00:04:40.199 did
00:04:40.350 need
00:04:40.500 a
00:04:40.530 little
00:04:40.830 more
00:04:40.979 salt

00:04:50.639 not
00:04:50.820 garnish
00:04:51.180 with
00:04:51.360 anything
00:04:51.930 except

00:04:52.350 possibly
00:04:52.500 a
00:04:52.800 few
00:04:52.979 chives
00:04:53.190 and
00:04:53.610 that's
00:04:53.880 only
00:04:54.060 if

00:04:54.210 you're
00:04:54.330 taking
00:04:54.630 pictures
00:04:54.660 this
00:04:55.380 needs

00:04:55.710 absolutely
00:04:56.190 nothing
00:04:56.639 especially
00:04:57.030 if
00:04:57.389 you're

00:04:57.510 serving
00:04:57.690 it
00:04:57.930 as

00:04:58.470 big
00:04:58.620 holiday
00:04:58.979 meal

00:04:59.070 and
00:04:59.729 yes
00:05:00.210 when
00:05:00.389 you
00:05:00.449 bring
00:05:00.600 that
00:05:00.720 to
00:05:00.840 the
00:05:00.960 table

00:05:01.110 people
00:05:01.530 will
00:05:01.650 be
00:05:01.770 thinking
00:05:01.919 hmm
00:05:02.639 those
00:05:03.000 mashed

00:05:03.210 potatoes
00:05:03.600 aren't
00:05:03.750 white
00:05:03.960 they're
00:05:04.229 almost

00:05:04.380 butter
00:05:04.770 colored
00:05:05.280 that's
00:05:06.120 probably
00:05:06.389 just
00:05:06.539 the

00:05:06.630 light
00:05:06.810 I'm
00:05:07.199 sure
00:05:07.380 it
00:05:07.440 doesn't
00:05:07.650 look
00:05:07.710 that
00:05:07.800 way

00:05:07.919 from
00:05:08.190 insane
00:05:08.490 amounts
00:05:08.789 of
00:05:08.880 butter
00:05:08.970 oh
00:05:09.270 but
00:05:09.810 it

00:05:09.930 does
00:05:10.169 and
00:05:10.440 seriously
00:05:11.010 one
00:05:11.190 taste
00:05:11.520 and
00:05:12.090 it
00:05:12.240 will

00:05:12.360 all
00:05:12.510 make
00:05:12.539 sense
00:05:12.720 it
00:05:13.289 is
00:05:13.650 just
00:05:13.919 beyond

00:05:14.850 and
00:05:15.030 there's
00:05:15.510 a
00:05:15.600 reason

00:05:18.539 way
