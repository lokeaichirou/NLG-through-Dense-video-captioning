00:03:03.390 of

00:03:03.690 flavor
00:03:03.959 the
00:03:04.859 texture
00:03:05.280 is
00:03:05.900 moist
00:03:06.900 but

00:03:07.650 reasonably
00:03:08.400 dry
00:03:08.670 it'll
00:03:08.970 hold
00:03:09.180 together

00:03:09.390 nicely
00:03:09.780 but

00:03:37.500 half

00:03:43.680 white
00:03:43.980 pepper

00:03:44.639 but
00:03:45.000 you
00:03:45.120 can
00:03:45.269 use

00:03:45.389 ground
00:03:45.630 black
00:03:45.870 pepper
00:03:45.930 either
00:03:46.739 will
00:03:46.980 do
00:03:47.180 now

00:03:48.180 why
00:03:48.359 did
00:03:48.540 I
00:03:48.630 use
00:03:48.660 white
00:03:49.079 pepper
00:03:49.319 you
00:03:49.530 might
00:03:49.680 ask

00:03:49.889 because
00:03:50.430 I've
00:03:50.700 run
00:03:50.940 out
00:03:51.090 of
00:03:51.120 black
00:03:51.389 and
00:03:51.660 white

00:03:51.739 tastes
00:03:52.739 really
00:03:52.980 great
00:03:53.220 anyway
00:03:53.900 okay
00:03:54.900 now
00:03:55.139 take

00:03:55.230 a
00:03:55.410 spoon
00:03:55.799 and
00:03:55.980 we
00:03:56.280 start
00:03:56.549 to
00:03:56.700 mix
00:03:56.910 those
00:03:57.239 spices

00:03:58.069 in
00:03:59.069 with
00:03:59.370 the
00:03:59.459 rest
00:03:59.639 of
00:03:59.819 our
00:03:59.940 mixture
00:04:00.389 here
00:04:00.739 now

00:04:01.739 I'll
00:04:01.889 just
00:04:02.040 show
00:04:02.220 you
00:04:02.280 now
00:04:02.549 this
00:04:02.819 is
00:04:02.879 almost

00:04:03.569 perfect
00:04:04.290 but
00:04:04.379 I
00:04:04.709 think
00:04:04.739 it's
00:04:05.160 a
00:04:05.280 little
00:04:05.669 bit
00:04:06.000 I

00:04:06.239 don't
00:04:06.959 know
00:04:07.019 if
00:04:07.109 I
00:04:07.200 can
00:04:07.260 if
00:04:07.590 you
00:04:07.680 can
00:04:07.859 see
00:04:08.069 that

00:04:08.220 there
00:04:08.400 but
00:04:08.549 it's
00:04:08.669 a
00:04:08.730 little
00:04:08.970 bit
00:04:09.209 damp
00:04:09.419 now
00:04:09.780 the

00:04:09.930 way
00:04:10.109 to
00:04:10.139 combat
00:04:10.919 that
00:04:11.099 and
00:04:11.160 that's
00:04:11.430 because

00:04:11.730 the
00:04:11.879 herbs
00:04:12.090 had
00:04:12.359 a
00:04:12.389 lot
00:04:12.540 of
00:04:12.569 moisture
00:04:13.019 in
00:04:13.049 them

00:04:13.260 is
00:04:13.379 just
00:04:13.620 to
00:04:14.069 add
00:04:14.220 about
00:04:14.370 a
00:04:14.519 tablespoon
00:04:14.819 to
00:04:15.359 two

00:04:15.389 tablespoons
00:04:15.720 of
00:04:16.199 flour
00:04:16.470 into
00:04:16.709 this
00:04:16.919 mixture

00:04:17.280 so
00:04:18.239 I'll
00:04:18.329 sprinkle
00:04:18.539 some
00:04:18.930 flour
00:04:19.079 over
00:04:19.530 there

00:04:19.969 that's
00:04:20.969 one
00:04:21.180 tablespoon
00:04:21.890 I'll
00:04:22.890 just
00:04:23.190 fold

00:04:23.430 that
00:04:23.610 through
00:04:23.669 and
00:04:24.180 see
00:04:24.539 if
00:04:24.630 that's
00:04:24.870 a

00:04:25.800 now
00:04:26.460 I
00:04:26.520 think
00:04:26.610 that's
00:04:26.850 enough
00:04:27.060 flour
00:04:27.300 they're

00:04:27.570 holding
00:04:27.870 it
00:04:27.960 together
00:04:28.200 nicely
00:04:28.410 they're
00:04:28.980 still

00:04:29.220 damp
00:04:29.460 but
00:04:30.000 let's
00:04:30.240 test
00:04:30.510 this
00:04:30.720 one
00:04:30.900 and
00:04:31.050 cook
00:04:31.230 it

00:04:31.350 off
00:04:31.500 now
00:04:32.100 I've
00:04:32.250 got
00:04:32.430 a
00:04:32.460 pan
00:04:32.850 a
00:04:32.880 deep
00:04:33.180 pan
00:04:33.450 with

00:04:33.660 about
00:04:33.750 three
00:04:34.170 inches
00:04:34.440 of
00:04:34.620 oil
00:04:34.740 here
00:04:35.100 and
00:04:35.190 I

00:04:35.280 want
00:04:35.460 to
00:04:35.550 bring
00:04:35.820 the
00:04:36.000 temperature
00:04:36.390 of
00:04:36.450 this

00:04:36.540 oil
00:04:36.810 up
00:04:37.020 to
00:04:37.410 about
00:04:37.590 350
00:04:38.100 375
00:04:38.640 degrees

00:04:39.360 Fahrenheit
00:04:39.510 that's
00:04:39.930 175
00:04:40.910 190
00:04:41.910 degrees

00:04:42.210 Celsius
00:04:42.720 so
00:04:42.930 I
00:04:43.590 reckon
00:04:43.920 that's
00:04:44.070 around
00:04:44.370 about

00:04:44.580 175
00:04:45.510 now
00:04:45.780 I
00:04:45.810 test
00:04:46.560 it
00:04:46.710 with
00:04:46.800 a
00:04:46.830 little
00:04:47.010 bit
00:04:47.190 of

00:04:47.310 bread
00:04:47.490 see
00:04:48.000 straight
00:04:48.360 away
00:04:48.570 that
00:04:48.600 fizzled
00:04:49.290 up

00:04:49.440 and
00:04:49.620 that's
00:04:50.040 going
00:04:50.340 to
00:04:50.460 cook
00:04:50.700 nicely
00:04:51.180 within

00:04:52.370 30
00:04:53.370 40
00:04:53.760 seconds
00:04:54.150 that
00:04:54.270 will
00:04:54.330 be
00:04:54.450 brown
00:04:54.660 so

00:04:55.410 that's
00:04:55.590 now
00:04:55.800 ready
00:04:56.160 for
00:04:56.430 the
00:04:56.910 falafels
00:04:57.420 just

00:04:57.960 making
00:04:58.320 Michel
00:04:58.710 apples
00:04:59.010 by
00:04:59.190 hand
00:04:59.490 I
00:04:59.670 just
00:04:59.850 roll

00:05:00.090 them
00:05:00.270 into
00:05:00.420 a
00:05:00.570 little
00:05:01.020 almond
00:05:01.380 shape
00:05:01.800 and
00:05:02.070 then

00:05:02.400 just
00:05:02.610 drop
00:05:02.850 them
00:05:03.030 into
00:05:03.300 the
00:05:03.420 oil
00:05:05.360 okay
00:05:06.360 once

00:05:06.600 he's
00:05:06.810 bubbling
00:05:07.470 away
00:05:07.560 like
00:05:07.860 that
00:05:07.890 I'm
00:05:08.100 just

00:05:08.130 going
00:05:08.340 to
00:05:08.430 use
00:05:08.610 a
00:05:08.640 slotted
00:05:09.000 spoon
00:05:09.210 to
00:05:09.360 drop
00:05:09.750 the

00:05:09.900 rest
00:05:10.050 of
00:05:10.230 them
00:05:10.320 in
00:05:10.470 probably
00:05:11.010 book
00:05:11.280 4
00:05:11.550 or
00:05:11.670 5
00:05:11.880 in

00:05:12.060 at
00:05:12.180 one
00:05:12.360 time
00:05:12.980 now
00:05:13.980 if
00:05:14.070 I
00:05:14.160 just
00:05:14.370 gently
00:05:14.730 put

00:05:15.000 slotted
00:05:15.300 spoon
00:05:15.540 in
00:05:15.870 there
00:05:16.020 I
00:05:16.230 mean
00:05:16.830 look
00:05:17.070 at

00:05:17.160 those
00:05:17.370 they're
00:05:17.580 holding
00:05:17.970 together

00:05:18.090 beautifully
00:05:18.810 they've
00:05:19.020 got
00:05:19.140 a
00:05:19.170 lovely
00:05:19.530 crusty

00:05:20.100 outside

00:05:40.320 the
00:05:40.500 best
00:05:40.770 falafel
00:05:41.100 I've
