00:03:25.850 my

00:03:26.060 is
00:03:26.120 kind
00:03:26.510 of

00:03:32.359 meat
00:03:32.540 in
00:03:32.690 this
00:03:32.810 consistency
00:03:33.590 it's

00:03:33.859 not
00:03:34.489 exactly
00:03:34.940 the
00:03:35.180 easiest
00:03:35.299 to

00:03:35.900 and

00:03:36.109 sauces
00:03:36.560 with

00:03:38.120 you
00:03:38.900 just
00:03:39.139 kind
00:03:39.380 of
00:03:39.530 rub
00:03:40.340 it

00:03:40.370 together
00:03:41.000 and
00:03:41.420 mix
00:03:41.690 it
00:03:41.840 around
00:03:42.069 it
00:03:43.069 it
00:03:43.519 does

00:03:43.760 take
00:03:44.030 a
00:03:44.060 couple
00:03:44.269 minutes
00:03:44.660 but
00:03:44.870 definitely
00:03:45.440 you

00:03:45.470 want
00:03:45.739 to
00:03:45.829 be
00:03:45.920 gentle
00:03:46.280 with
00:03:46.400 your
00:03:46.549 meat
00:03:46.700 at
00:03:46.819 this

00:03:46.970 point
00:03:47.299 even
00:03:47.600 though
00:03:47.930 we've
00:03:48.170 just
00:03:48.650 chopped
00:03:49.160 it

00:03:49.370 up
00:03:49.489 really
00:03:50.139 really
00:03:51.139 small
00:03:51.350 pieces
00:03:51.650 but
00:03:52.100 you

00:03:52.489 know
00:03:52.579 you
00:03:52.670 don't
00:03:52.819 want
00:03:52.970 to
00:03:53.060 mash
00:03:53.209 it
00:03:53.420 any
00:03:53.540 more

00:03:53.780 than
00:03:53.989 that
00:03:54.170 so
00:03:54.950 just
00:03:55.430 be
00:03:55.579 gentle
00:03:56.000 with
00:03:56.120 it
00:03:56.389 mix

00:03:57.139 it
00:03:57.290 around
00:03:57.410 it
00:03:57.799 might
00:03:57.980 take
00:03:58.220 a
00:03:58.250 couple
00:03:58.400 minutes

00:03:58.790 but
00:03:59.180 you
00:03:59.209 can
00:03:59.569 certainly
00:03:59.900 get
00:04:00.109 it
00:04:00.290 to
00:04:00.829 where

00:04:01.010 you

00:04:02.299 no
00:04:02.450 hard

00:04:02.690 and
00:04:02.750 fast
00:04:02.840 rules
00:04:03.319 on
00:04:03.590 your
00:04:03.680 ratios
00:04:04.099 here

00:04:05.180 flavor
00:04:05.540 you
00:04:05.690 want
00:04:05.930 that's
00:04:06.139 how
00:04:06.349 much

00:04:06.530 of
00:04:06.560 the
00:04:06.769 spicy
00:04:07.010 tuna
00:04:07.250 sauce
00:04:07.639 you
00:04:07.880 mix
00:04:08.090 in

00:04:08.329 whatever
00:04:09.200 you
00:04:09.500 think
00:04:09.769 meets
00:04:10.069 your
00:04:10.190 spiciness

00:04:10.819 taste
00:04:11.150 now
00:04:12.489 we
00:04:13.489 also
00:04:13.669 have
00:04:14.230 the
00:04:15.230 avocado

00:04:15.799 slices
00:04:16.549 that
00:04:16.880 we're
00:04:17.030 going
00:04:17.150 to
00:04:17.209 include
00:04:17.359 well

00:04:17.720 so
00:04:17.989 here
00:04:18.200 we
00:04:18.289 have
00:04:18.380 an
00:04:18.500 avocado
00:04:18.739 that
00:04:19.160 we've

00:04:19.280 already
00:04:19.400 sliced
00:04:19.729 in
00:04:19.910 half

00:04:20.889 here
00:04:21.039 you
00:04:21.189 can
00:04:21.340 just
00:04:21.370 see
00:04:21.549 with
00:04:21.819 the
00:04:21.909 sharp

00:04:22.150 knife
00:04:22.419 going
00:04:22.689 through
00:04:22.780 the
00:04:23.020 avocado
00:04:23.439 like

00:04:23.710 butter
00:04:23.949 it
00:04:24.249 really
00:04:25.150 is
00:04:25.240 a
00:04:25.270 pleasure
00:04:25.599 to
00:04:25.780 cut

00:04:25.990 with
00:04:26.169 those
00:04:26.349 sharp
00:04:26.650 knives
00:04:27.150 so
00:04:28.150 we
00:04:29.110 were

00:04:29.529 making
00:04:29.949 consistent
00:04:30.520 thin
00:04:31.120 slices
00:04:31.659 from
00:04:31.779 the

00:04:31.900 avocado
00:04:32.110 if
00:04:32.620 you
00:04:32.740 want
00:04:32.889 to
00:04:32.979 slice

00:04:33.159 horizontally
00:04:33.400 instead
00:04:34.120 of
00:04:34.330 vertically

00:04:34.749 that's
00:04:35.529 fine
00:04:35.830 too
00:04:36.099 it
00:04:37.029 really
00:04:37.389 is
00:04:37.509 just

00:04:37.539 personal
00:04:38.080 preference
00:04:38.319 at
00:04:38.590 that
00:04:38.770 point
00:04:39.009 and

00:04:39.360 after
00:04:40.360 we
00:04:40.599 slice
00:04:40.810 our
00:04:40.990 avocado
00:04:41.439 we
00:04:42.039 want
00:04:42.279 to
00:04:42.370 be

00:04:42.460 sure
00:04:42.729 to
00:04:42.939 add
00:04:43.120 a
00:04:43.150 little
00:04:43.749 bit
00:04:43.990 of
00:04:44.110 lemon
00:04:44.229 on
00:04:44.439 top

00:04:44.499 we
00:04:45.039 don't
00:04:45.219 want
00:04:45.370 our
00:04:45.460 avocado
00:04:45.999 turning
00:04:46.900 brown

00:04:47.080 in
00:04:47.289 the
00:04:47.349 middle
00:04:47.590 of
00:04:47.650 our
00:04:47.680 sushi
00:04:48.129 roll
00:04:48.310 even

00:04:49.150 though
00:04:49.240 it
00:04:49.360 tastes
00:04:49.689 fine
00:04:49.840 it
00:04:50.110 really
00:04:50.139 does
00:04:50.590 get

00:04:50.800 to
00:04:50.979 be
00:04:51.129 rather
00:04:51.340 unappetizing
00:04:53.520 now
00:04:54.520 we're

00:04:54.789 going
00:04:54.879 to
00:04:54.939 put
00:04:55.180 it
00:04:55.330 on
00:04:55.449 our
00:04:55.479 Maki
00:04:56.050 sushi
00:04:56.349 base

00:04:56.740 if
00:04:57.009 you
00:04:57.520 don't
00:04:57.729 know
00:04:57.819 how
00:04:57.939 to
00:04:58.000 make
00:04:58.210 the
00:04:58.360 base

00:04:58.569 here
00:04:59.289 with
00:05:00.069 the
00:05:00.219 rice
00:05:00.430 in
00:05:00.639 the
00:05:00.669 seaweed
00:05:01.090 please

00:05:01.719 see
00:05:01.990 our
00:05:02.020 Maki
00:05:02.379 sushi
00:05:02.650 video
00:05:03.210 we
00:05:04.210 explain
00:05:04.569 how

00:05:04.719 to
00:05:04.779 do
00:05:04.930 that
00:05:05.050 in
00:05:05.259 depth
00:05:05.529 and
00:05:05.800 really
00:05:05.979 walk
00:05:06.340 you

00:05:06.490 through
00:05:06.699 that
00:05:06.849 process
00:05:07.120 so
00:05:08.069 what
00:05:09.069 we're
00:05:09.219 doing

00:05:09.250 is
00:05:09.610 we're
00:05:09.789 adding
00:05:10.180 the
00:05:10.330 spicy
00:05:10.659 tuna
00:05:11.110 mixture

00:05:12.150 it's
00:05:13.150 hard
00:05:13.360 to
00:05:13.479 tell
00:05:13.659 from
00:05:13.719 the
00:05:13.990 camera
00:05:14.349 angle

00:05:14.680 but
00:05:14.830 it
00:05:15.430 is
00:05:15.610 slightly
00:05:16.300 closer
00:05:16.599 to
00:05:17.050 the
00:05:17.229 chef
00:05:17.830 or

00:05:18.129 a
00:05:18.189 model
00:05:18.999 if
00:05:19.089 you
00:05:19.120 will
00:05:19.449 and
00:05:19.659 you
00:05:20.080 want
00:05:20.319 to

00:05:20.409 extend
00:05:20.680 it
00:05:20.889 all
00:05:21.069 the
00:05:21.249 way
00:05:21.370 to
00:05:21.430 the
00:05:21.610 edges

00:05:21.759 that's
00:05:22.210 really
00:05:22.569 important
00:05:23.050 you
00:05:23.139 don't
00:05:23.259 want

00:05:23.379 to
00:05:23.650 have
00:05:23.770 the
00:05:23.949 orphaned
00:05:24.400 sushi
00:05:25.360 pieces
00:05:25.509 on
00:05:25.900 the

00:05:26.020 end
00:05:26.169 that
00:05:26.289 don't
00:05:26.560 have
00:05:26.740 any
00:05:26.889 fish
00:05:27.099 in
00:05:27.279 them
00:05:27.430 so

00:05:28.060 definitely
00:05:28.389 extend
00:05:29.050 it
00:05:29.199 a
00:05:29.289 little
00:05:29.319 bit
00:05:29.889 past

00:05:30.189 the
00:05:30.699 nori
00:05:31.569 or
00:05:31.930 seaweed
00:05:32.349 if
00:05:32.439 you
00:05:32.560 will
00:05:32.770 and

00:05:33.009 that's
00:05:33.849 really
00:05:34.270 really
00:05:34.659 important
00:05:36.479 so
00:05:37.479 after

00:05:37.930 we
00:05:38.020 do
00:05:38.139 that
00:05:38.169 we
00:05:38.620 want
00:05:38.770 to
00:05:38.919 get
00:05:39.099 our
00:05:39.310 avocado

00:05:39.879 slices
00:05:40.240 and
00:05:40.629 they
00:05:40.930 do
00:05:40.990 have
00:05:41.379 the
00:05:41.529 habit
00:05:41.889 of

00:05:41.979 sticking
00:05:42.189 together
00:05:42.490 on
00:05:42.849 the
00:05:42.939 plate
00:05:43.349 what
00:05:44.349 we

00:05:44.500 found
00:05:44.830 after
00:05:45.729 making
00:05:45.909 the
00:05:46.060 videos
00:05:46.360 that

00:05:46.659 really
00:05:46.810 helps
00:05:47.289 is
00:05:47.740 to
00:05:47.800 add
00:05:48.310 some
00:05:48.849 lemon
00:05:49.060 juice

00:05:49.270 between
00:05:49.899 the
00:05:50.050 slices
00:05:50.289 and
00:05:50.860 also
00:05:51.789 on
00:05:52.029 the
00:05:52.149 plate

00:05:52.419 below
00:05:52.629 that
00:05:52.960 helps
00:05:53.229 them
00:05:53.349 slide
00:05:53.649 right
00:05:53.889 off

00:05:53.919 the
00:05:54.219 plate
00:05:54.839 so
00:05:56.310 you
00:05:57.310 will
00:05:57.430 see
00:05:57.639 how
00:05:57.849 my
00:05:58.089 is

00:05:58.149 adding
00:05:58.810 the
00:05:59.199 avocado
00:05:59.770 slices
00:06:00.099 they're

00:06:00.490 slightly
00:06:00.849 at
00:06:01.060 an
00:06:01.120 angle
00:06:01.479 you
00:06:01.659 don't
00:06:01.779 need
00:06:01.930 to

00:06:02.050 go
00:06:02.169 perfectly
00:06:02.919 horizontal
00:06:03.930 and
00:06:04.930 that's
00:06:05.589 where

00:06:05.979 you
00:06:06.099 want
00:06:06.310 it
00:06:06.430 that's
00:06:06.580 what
00:06:06.759 you
00:06:06.849 want
00:06:07.029 to
00:06:07.149 look

00:06:07.300 like
00:06:07.509 before
00:06:08.020 we
00:06:08.289 go
00:06:08.889 ahead
00:06:09.009 and
00:06:09.279 roll
00:06:09.460 the

00:06:09.580 pieces
00:06:09.789 together

00:06:11.610 now
00:06:12.139 you
00:06:13.139 grab
00:06:13.680 the
00:06:13.889 bamboo
00:06:14.250 mat
00:06:14.659 lift
00:06:15.659 it
00:06:15.870 over

00:06:16.729 enough
00:06:17.729 for
00:06:18.030 it
00:06:18.240 to
00:06:18.419 touch
00:06:18.629 the
00:06:18.840 other
00:06:18.960 side
00:06:19.289 of

00:06:19.439 the
00:06:19.530 sushi
00:06:19.889 and
00:06:20.099 with
00:06:20.699 a
00:06:20.729 firm
00:06:21.240 gripping

00:06:21.719 motion
00:06:22.139 that's
00:06:22.530 how
00:06:22.889 we
00:06:22.949 really
00:06:23.490 get
00:06:23.639 the

00:06:23.789 sushi
00:06:24.120 to
00:06:24.210 come
00:06:24.360 together
00:06:24.539 now
00:06:25.409 you
00:06:25.500 don't

00:06:25.800 want
00:06:25.979 to
00:06:26.069 smash
00:06:26.310 it
00:06:26.580 together
00:06:26.909 you
00:06:27.330 do
00:06:27.509 want
00:06:27.719 to

00:06:27.810 be
00:06:27.930 firm
00:06:28.259 but
00:06:29.159 I
00:06:29.219 definitely
00:06:29.460 don't
00:06:29.969 want
00:06:30.180 to

00:06:30.270 just
00:06:30.449 mash
00:06:30.810 all
00:06:31.080 the
00:06:31.199 gradients
00:06:31.740 in
00:06:31.889 the

00:06:31.979 middle
00:06:32.219 together
00:06:32.719 it
00:06:33.719 really
00:06:33.960 is
00:06:34.199 a
00:06:34.229 fine
00:06:34.500 line

00:06:34.710 that
00:06:34.979 comes
00:06:35.189 over
00:06:35.490 time
00:06:35.639 a
00:06:35.699 little
00:06:35.879 bit
00:06:36.060 of

00:06:36.150 practice
00:06:36.569 and
00:06:36.780 I'm
00:06:36.840 sure
00:06:37.020 you
00:06:37.139 can
00:06:37.259 get
00:06:37.379 it

00:06:37.469 down
00:06:37.620 so
00:06:38.340 we
00:06:38.370 flipped
00:06:38.759 it
00:06:38.849 over
00:06:39.000 again
00:06:39.330 with

00:06:40.080 the
00:06:40.349 firm
00:06:40.590 gripping
00:06:41.039 motion
00:06:41.460 once
00:06:41.969 again
00:06:42.360 and

00:06:42.569 the
00:06:43.259 saran
00:06:43.500 wrap
00:06:43.710 sometimes
00:06:44.159 sticks
00:06:44.430 together

00:06:44.789 but
00:06:45.300 it's
00:06:45.689 not
00:06:45.900 a
00:06:46.050 problem
00:06:46.319 at
00:06:46.650 all
00:06:46.710 and
00:06:47.360 there

00:06:48.360 we
00:06:48.509 go
00:06:48.629 the
00:06:48.840 last
00:06:49.050 round
00:06:49.379 squeeze
00:06:50.039 it
00:06:50.159 a
00:06:50.219 little

00:06:50.370 bit
00:06:50.520 more
00:06:50.699 you'll
00:06:51.090 see
00:06:51.270 some
00:06:51.479 of
00:06:51.569 the
00:06:51.629 spicy

00:06:51.870 tuna
00:06:52.169 coming
00:06:53.129 out
00:06:53.219 the
00:06:53.370 sides

00:06:53.849 if
00:06:53.909 you
00:06:54.419 squeeze
00:06:54.689 it
00:06:54.840 so
00:06:55.020 hard
00:06:55.259 that
00:06:55.439 all
00:06:55.500 of
00:06:55.650 it

00:06:55.770 pops
00:06:55.949 out
00:06:56.250 you
00:06:56.550 definitely
00:06:57.270 know
00:06:57.389 you're

00:06:57.419 gripping
00:06:58.199 too
00:06:58.349 hard
00:06:58.620 but
00:06:59.550 if
00:06:59.849 it
00:06:59.969 does
00:07:00.120 come

00:07:00.300 out
00:07:00.419 just
00:07:00.599 a
00:07:00.779 little
00:07:00.810 bit
00:07:01.139 like
00:07:01.319 so
00:07:01.590 that's

00:07:02.250 perfectly
00:07:02.819 normal

00:07:03.330 and
00:07:03.449 that's
00:07:03.750 what
00:07:03.990 you
00:07:04.110 want
00:07:04.289 it
00:07:04.379 to
00:07:04.409 look
00:07:04.650 like

00:07:04.919 right
00:07:05.400 there
00:07:05.699 so
00:07:06.569 the
00:07:06.750 next
00:07:06.960 step
00:07:07.289 is
00:07:07.560 to
00:07:07.830 add
00:07:07.979 a

00:07:08.009 little
00:07:08.400 bit
00:07:08.639 of
00:07:08.879 the
00:07:09.090 sesame
00:07:09.569 seeds
00:07:09.840 on
00:07:10.020 the

00:07:10.139 side
00:07:10.580 roasted
00:07:11.580 sesame
00:07:11.789 seeds
00:07:12.210 that
00:07:12.419 is
00:07:12.569 and

00:07:12.779 you'll
00:07:13.710 notice
00:07:14.039 we
00:07:14.250 put
00:07:14.460 it
00:07:14.729 on
00:07:14.849 top
00:07:15.150 enough
00:07:15.870 to

00:07:16.050 coat
00:07:16.319 lightly
00:07:16.830 and
00:07:17.009 Pat
00:07:17.789 it
00:07:17.969 in
00:07:18.120 just
00:07:18.360 a
00:07:18.479 touch

00:07:19.400 now
00:07:20.400 next
00:07:20.969 we
00:07:21.240 put
00:07:21.449 on
00:07:21.599 a
00:07:21.629 cutting
00:07:21.990 board
00:07:22.139 and

00:07:22.550 this
00:07:23.550 is
00:07:23.819 really
00:07:24.360 where
00:07:24.539 the
00:07:24.750 sharp
00:07:25.080 knife

00:07:25.379 pays
00:07:26.190 off
00:07:26.990 incredible
00:07:27.990 dividends
00:07:28.520 notice

00:07:29.520 Sarah

00:07:29.940 slicing
00:07:30.389 right
00:07:30.419 through
00:07:30.599 and
00:07:31.050 for

00:07:34.979 that
00:07:35.009 we
00:07:35.250 use
00:07:35.490 the

00:07:35.699 rice
00:07:35.940 cooker
00:07:36.449 for

00:07:37.169 rice
00:07:37.379 that
00:07:37.409 we

00:07:41.099 you'll

00:07:41.759 notice
00:07:41.849 that
00:07:42.449 it
00:07:43.139 doesn't
00:07:43.250 clump
00:07:44.250 up
00:07:44.550 as
00:07:45.050 bad

00:07:46.050 when
00:07:46.319 you
00:07:46.439 cut
00:07:46.620 through
00:07:46.919 it

00:07:51.330 stove
00:07:51.569 type
00:07:51.870 rice
00:07:52.379 comes
00:07:52.740 out

00:07:52.919 the
00:07:53.099 same
00:07:53.339 but
00:07:53.939 with
00:07:54.060 the
00:07:54.150 rice
00:07:54.360 cooker
00:07:54.779 you

00:07:54.930 can
00:07:55.110 see
00:07:55.289 that's
00:07:55.500 where
00:07:55.710 you
00:07:55.800 really
00:07:55.979 get

00:07:56.219 these
00:07:56.400 neat
00:07:56.669 cuts
00:07:57.029 that
00:07:57.330 you
00:07:57.479 can
00:07:57.629 really
00:07:57.990 tell

00:07:58.229 when
00:07:58.500 you're
00:07:59.069 cutting
00:07:59.339 your
00:08:00.029 sushi
00:08:00.270 rolls
00:08:00.659 in

00:08:00.839 particular
00:08:02.990 so
00:08:03.990 here
00:08:04.740 we
00:08:04.919 are
00:08:04.949 you
00:08:05.729 know
00:08:05.819 how

00:08:06.000 thick
00:08:06.270 you
00:08:06.419 want
00:08:06.449 your
00:08:06.659 rolls
00:08:06.930 and
00:08:07.169 things

00:08:07.379 like
00:08:07.529 that
00:08:07.589 is
00:08:08.009 really
00:08:08.819 just
00:08:09.419 up
00:08:09.659 to
00:08:09.810 personal

00:08:10.020 preference
00:08:10.529 it's
00:08:11.250 whatever
00:08:11.430 you
00:08:11.699 like
00:08:11.939 I

00:08:12.150 think
00:08:12.930 we're
00:08:13.080 cutting
00:08:13.349 them
00:08:13.409 a
00:08:13.500 little
00:08:13.740 bit

00:08:13.860 thinner
00:08:14.099 here
00:08:14.430 but
00:08:14.639 that's
00:08:14.789 because
00:08:14.939 we
00:08:15.150 have

00:08:15.240 a
00:08:15.300 family
00:08:15.750 and
00:08:15.960 well
00:08:16.199 like
00:08:16.379 to
00:08:16.469 have
00:08:16.560 a
00:08:16.589 lot
00:08:16.889 of

00:08:16.919 pieces
00:08:17.159 of
00:08:17.460 a
00:08:17.520 lot
00:08:17.639 of
00:08:17.669 different
00:08:18.029 flavored

00:08:18.419 sushi
00:08:18.779 so
00:08:19.709 when
00:08:20.190 you
00:08:20.279 cut
00:08:20.490 it
00:08:20.639 that's
00:08:20.880 what
00:08:21.089 it

00:08:21.180 will
00:08:21.240 look
00:08:21.419 like
00:08:21.479 and
00:08:21.990 the
00:08:22.709 next
00:08:22.979 step
00:08:23.190 is
