00:00:15.430 you
00:00:15.610 how
00:00:15.639 to

00:00:16.360 recipe
00:00:16.720 for
00:00:17.170 chicken
00:00:17.470 parmesan
00:00:18.779 you

00:00:19.779 will
00:00:19.960 need

00:03:18.960 together
00:03:19.500 the
00:03:19.890 chicken
00:03:20.220 should

00:03:20.370 be
00:03:20.520 pretty
00:03:20.760 much
00:03:21.500 defrosted
00:03:22.500 and
00:03:22.820 we're
00:03:23.820 going

00:03:24.030 to
00:03:24.120 dredge
00:03:24.330 it
00:03:24.360 in
00:03:24.630 the
00:03:24.690 flour
00:03:26.630 so
00:03:27.630 it's
00:03:27.840 nice

00:03:28.110 and
00:03:28.770 evenly
00:03:29.160 coated

00:03:33.720 then
00:03:34.080 into
00:03:34.440 the
00:03:34.560 egg

00:03:34.590 mixture
00:03:35.130 and
00:03:37.730 looks
00:03:38.730 like
00:03:38.880 these
00:03:39.090 are

00:03:39.240 probably
00:03:39.360 fall
00:03:39.840 apart
00:03:40.170 so
00:03:40.260 I'm
00:03:40.470 just
00:03:40.680 going
00:03:40.830 to

00:03:53.610 chicken

00:03:53.970 in
00:03:54.090 there
00:03:54.300 so
00:03:55.140 the
00:03:55.290 breadcrumbs
00:03:55.740 can
00:03:55.920 just
00:03:56.130 go

00:03:56.250 right
00:03:56.280 over
00:03:56.490 it

00:04:03.830 that
00:04:04.830 fresh
00:04:05.100 parsley

00:04:05.400 in
00:04:05.760 there
00:04:05.790 will
00:04:06.210 crisp
00:04:06.630 up
00:04:06.810 and
00:04:07.080 taste
00:04:07.320 really

00:04:08.990 same
00:04:09.990 with
00:04:10.140 the
00:04:10.290 parmesan
00:04:12.020 and
00:04:13.020 after
00:04:13.350 you're

00:04:13.470 done
00:04:13.650 coating

00:04:35.640 in

00:04:39.169 this
00:04:39.529 doesn't
