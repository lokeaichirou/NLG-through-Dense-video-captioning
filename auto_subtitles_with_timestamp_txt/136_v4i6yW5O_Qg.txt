00:00:17.220 recreate
00:00:17.520 the

00:00:17.730 first
00:00:17.940 time
00:00:18.090 I
00:00:18.150 had

00:00:20.400 19
00:00:20.760 and

00:00:39.350 all
00:00:40.350 my
00:00:40.590 ingredients

00:00:40.710 perhaps
00:00:41.370 that
00:00:41.610 is
00:00:41.790 super
00:00:42.120 important
00:00:42.510 when

00:00:42.540 you're
00:00:42.750 doing
00:00:42.930 any
00:00:43.079 kind
00:00:43.170 of
00:00:43.379 stir-fried
00:00:44.010 dish

00:00:44.190 because
00:00:44.489 everything
00:00:44.940 moves
00:00:45.239 really
00:00:45.480 fast

00:00:45.809 once
00:00:46.140 you
00:00:46.320 get
00:00:47.070 going
00:00:47.309 on
00:00:47.579 the
00:00:47.670 heat
00:00:47.879 so
00:00:48.059 you

00:00:48.120 want
00:00:48.270 to
00:00:48.329 make
00:00:48.450 sure
00:00:48.480 that
00:00:48.809 you've
00:00:48.930 got
00:00:48.989 your

00:00:49.950 simply
00:00:50.489 in
00:00:51.320 plot
00:00:52.320 or
00:00:52.649 in
00:00:53.070 place
00:00:53.309 okay
00:00:53.730 so

00:00:54.210 for
00:00:54.690 the
00:00:54.809 sauce
00:00:55.079 I've
00:00:55.440 got

00:00:55.949 tamarind

00:00:56.420 liquid
00:00:57.420 tamarind
00:00:57.989 juice
00:00:58.199 tamarind

00:00:58.680 concentrate
00:00:58.800 this
00:00:59.760 is
00:00:59.879 what
00:01:00.030 a
00:01:00.059 tamarind
00:01:00.570 bean

00:01:00.840 looks
00:01:01.170 like
00:01:01.410 you
00:01:01.649 can
00:01:01.829 find
00:01:02.219 these
00:01:02.579 whole
00:01:02.940 and

00:01:03.359 a
00:01:03.420 lot
00:01:03.570 of
00:01:03.600 like
00:01:04.110 Hispanic
00:01:04.680 or
00:01:04.920 Latin
00:01:05.250 markets

00:01:05.580 or
00:01:05.790 Asian
00:01:06.090 markets
00:01:06.420 and
00:01:06.630 then
00:01:07.260 you
00:01:07.380 can
00:01:07.500 find

00:01:07.770 this
00:01:08.100 juice
00:01:08.750 in
00:01:09.799 Asian
00:01:10.799 markets
00:01:11.010 also
00:01:11.670 so

00:01:12.180 using
00:01:12.930 some
00:01:13.140 of
00:01:13.170 that
00:01:13.320 if
00:01:13.470 you
00:01:13.560 can't
00:01:13.830 find
00:01:13.920 it

00:01:14.100 for
00:01:14.250 some
00:01:14.369 reason
00:01:14.610 you
00:01:14.700 could
00:01:14.820 use
00:01:14.939 a
00:01:15.119 lime

00:01:15.689 juice
00:01:15.960 but
00:01:16.170 use
00:01:16.350 a
00:01:16.380 little
00:01:16.650 bit
00:01:16.740 less
00:01:17.040 than
00:01:17.759 the

00:01:17.820 recipe
00:01:18.210 calls
00:01:18.390 for
00:01:18.479 for
00:01:18.780 the
00:01:18.869 tamarind

00:01:19.290 because
00:01:19.530 it's
00:01:19.680 limes
00:01:19.979 a
00:01:20.130 little
00:01:20.340 harder
00:01:20.850 so

00:01:21.030 tamarind
00:01:21.390 is
00:01:21.509 very
00:01:21.720 tart
00:01:22.080 we're
00:01:22.710 gonna

00:01:22.830 balance
00:01:23.070 that
00:01:23.520 with
00:01:23.880 some
00:01:24.270 sugar
00:01:24.659 and
00:01:24.810 I

00:01:24.990 should
00:01:25.170 be
00:01:25.290 using
00:01:25.590 palm
00:01:25.920 sugar
00:01:26.340 but
00:01:27.180 I'm
00:01:27.360 using

00:01:27.780 light
00:01:27.960 brown
00:01:27.990 sugar
00:01:28.530 because
00:01:28.680 it's
00:01:29.520 a
00:01:29.729 lot

00:01:29.880 easier
00:01:30.119 to
00:01:30.210 find
00:01:30.329 than
00:01:30.479 palm
00:01:30.659 sugar
00:01:30.869 and
00:01:31.939 some

00:01:32.939 fish
00:01:33.180 sauce
00:01:33.420 and
00:01:33.810 if
00:01:33.930 you
00:01:34.079 are
00:01:34.229 a
00:01:34.259 vegetarian

00:01:34.650 and
00:01:35.159 you
00:01:35.220 don't
00:01:35.369 want
00:01:35.490 to
00:01:35.520 use
00:01:35.640 fish
00:01:35.850 sauce
00:01:35.880 I

00:01:36.360 think
00:01:37.140 that
00:01:37.650 you
00:01:38.490 can
00:01:38.700 find
00:01:38.970 vegan
00:01:39.560 fish
00:01:40.560 sauce

00:01:40.829 that's
00:01:41.340 like
00:01:41.579 sort
00:01:42.329 of
00:01:42.420 flavored
00:01:42.810 like
00:01:43.020 fish

00:01:43.170 sauce
00:01:43.350 that
00:01:43.590 doesn't
00:01:43.890 have
00:01:43.979 fish
00:01:44.130 in
00:01:44.159 it
00:01:44.399 I

00:01:44.520 think
00:01:45.090 if
00:01:45.810 not
00:01:46.079 you
00:01:46.229 could
00:01:46.380 use
00:01:46.470 some
00:01:46.619 soy

00:01:46.829 sauce
00:01:47.570 so
00:01:48.570 what
00:01:48.869 we're
00:01:48.990 doing
00:01:49.200 here
00:01:49.470 is
00:01:50.310 like

00:01:50.579 getting
00:01:51.360 a
00:01:51.479 good
00:01:51.720 balance
00:01:52.200 between
00:01:52.369 sour

00:01:53.369 which
00:01:53.850 is
00:01:53.970 the
00:01:54.090 tamarind
00:01:54.540 and
00:01:54.780 sweet
00:01:55.140 and

00:01:55.409 salty
00:01:56.100 which
00:01:56.850 is
00:01:57.149 the
00:01:57.479 fish
00:01:57.960 sauce
00:01:58.200 I
00:01:58.469 really

00:01:58.860 like
00:01:59.009 this
00:01:59.219 red
00:01:59.820 boat
00:02:00.000 brand
00:02:00.329 it's
00:02:01.170 just
00:02:01.469 made

00:02:01.619 from
00:02:01.740 anchovies
00:02:02.250 it
00:02:02.369 doesn't
00:02:02.579 have
00:02:02.670 any
00:02:02.880 sugar

00:02:02.909 or
00:02:03.210 anything
00:02:03.390 in
00:02:03.630 it
00:02:03.750 so
00:02:03.990 it's
00:02:04.170 just
00:02:04.369 got
00:02:05.369 a

00:02:05.759 salty
00:02:06.570 briny
00:02:07.530 flavor
00:02:08.690 just
00:02:09.690 good

00:02:10.160 combined
00:02:11.260 and
00:02:12.260 then
00:02:12.530 we'll
00:02:12.950 set
00:02:13.250 that

00:04:59.349 oil
00:04:59.469 but

00:04:59.919 peanut
00:05:00.340 oil
00:05:00.699 is
00:05:00.789 probably
00:05:01.000 more
00:05:01.900 traditional

00:05:02.379 once

00:05:07.569 seconds
00:05:08.050 and
00:05:08.469 in
00:05:08.710 this
00:05:08.830 case

00:05:09.009 you
00:05:09.189 do
00:05:09.430 want
00:05:09.699 the
00:05:09.819 garlic

00:05:17.650 about
00:05:17.740 15
00:05:18.159 seconds
