00:03:06.170 is
00:03:06.319 a

00:03:06.349 slight
00:03:06.680 difference
00:03:07.370 in

00:03:07.819 though
00:03:08.180 I

00:03:08.209 prefer
00:03:09.010 the
00:03:10.010 turmeric

00:03:39.260 add
00:03:39.500 my

00:03:40.180 potatoes

00:03:43.760 can
00:03:44.030 cook
00:03:44.480 with

00:03:44.690 these

00:03:55.470 it
00:03:55.560 about
00:03:55.680 five
00:03:55.830 minutes

00:04:31.430 really
00:04:31.610 well

00:04:42.580 chicken
00:04:43.360 theory
00:04:43.569 is
00:04:43.659 so
00:04:43.870 easy
00:04:44.169 to
00:04:44.470 make
00:04:44.650 and

00:04:44.919 get

00:04:58.569 of
00:04:58.719 our
00:04:58.930 common
00:04:59.500 dishes

00:05:09.070 so
00:05:09.640 we're
00:05:09.790 going
00:05:09.940 to
00:05:10.030 cover

00:05:13.090 seven
00:05:14.080 eight
00:05:14.230 minutes
00:05:18.900 but
00:05:19.900 until
00:05:20.200 the

00:05:20.410 chicken
00:05:20.740 is
00:05:20.860 almost
00:05:21.340 done
00:05:21.670 and

00:05:29.530 tick
00:05:29.770 every
00:05:29.950 one
00:05:31.920 so
00:05:32.920 it
00:05:33.100 has
00:05:33.310 been
00:05:33.670 good

00:05:34.270 seven

00:05:39.970 done
00:05:40.240 quite
00:05:40.480 yet
00:05:40.600 so
