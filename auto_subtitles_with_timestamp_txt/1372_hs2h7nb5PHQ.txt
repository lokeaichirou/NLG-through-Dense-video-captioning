00:01:17.939 in

00:01:18.060 this
00:01:18.180 chowder

00:01:19.320 point

00:01:20.100 I'll
00:01:20.490 show
00:01:20.729 you
00:01:20.790 later
00:01:21.060 when
00:01:21.570 you
00:01:21.750 could
00:01:21.960 add

00:01:22.110 the
00:01:22.259 frozen
00:01:22.439 potatoes
00:01:23.070 in
00:01:23.340 and
00:01:24.000 you're
00:01:24.750 going

00:01:24.869 to
00:01:24.900 let
00:01:25.049 these
00:01:25.229 simmer
00:01:25.640 until
00:01:26.640 the
00:01:26.939 potatoes

00:01:27.150 are
00:01:27.570 tender
00:01:27.950 now
00:01:28.950 let's
00:01:29.189 grab
00:01:29.430 our
00:01:29.579 second
00:01:30.030 pot

00:01:30.180 to
00:01:30.390 make
00:01:30.570 the
00:01:30.630 chowder
00:01:31.079 you
00:01:31.439 will
00:01:32.400 need
00:01:32.549 1/2

00:01:32.700 cup
00:01:32.939 of
00:01:33.299 butter
00:01:33.600 and
00:01:34.409 I
00:01:34.530 usually
00:01:34.680 chop
00:01:35.100 it
00:01:35.280 up

00:01:35.369 to
00:01:35.850 put
00:01:36.000 it
00:01:36.060 in
00:01:36.210 the
00:01:36.299 pot
00:01:36.479 just
00:01:36.750 so
00:01:37.049 it'll
00:01:37.200 melt

00:01:37.500 faster
00:01:38.509 and
00:01:40.729 then
00:01:41.729 you
00:01:41.880 will
00:01:42.030 need
00:01:42.240 a
00:01:42.270 quart
00:01:42.750 of

00:01:49.720 and
00:01:49.920 then
00:01:50.920 four
00:01:51.250 cups
00:01:51.580 of
00:01:51.760 milk
00:01:52.030 you
00:01:52.270 can
00:01:52.390 use

00:01:52.720 whole
00:01:53.170 milk
00:01:53.200 but
00:01:54.130 we
00:01:54.280 have
00:01:54.430 skim
00:01:54.790 in
00:01:54.910 our
00:01:55.000 house

00:01:55.210 the
00:01:55.480 skin
00:01:55.750 works
00:01:55.990 fine
00:01:56.320 the
00:01:56.830 soup
00:01:57.220 still

00:01:57.610 thickens
00:01:58.300 up
00:01:58.450 really
00:01:58.960 well
00:01:59.140 so
00:01:59.470 don't
00:02:00.460 worry

00:02:00.610 about
00:02:00.760 that
00:02:01.150 and
00:02:02.140 then
00:02:02.890 you'll
00:02:03.040 need
00:02:03.220 a
00:02:03.280 cup
00:02:03.880 of

00:02:04.060 corn
00:02:04.390 starch
00:02:04.600 I
00:02:05.640 know
00:02:06.640 I
00:02:06.670 add
00:02:07.030 it
00:02:07.210 in
00:02:07.360 when
00:02:07.600 all

00:02:07.750 my
00:02:07.930 milk
00:02:08.170 is
00:02:08.380 still
00:02:08.560 very
00:02:08.800 cold
00:02:09.190 that
00:02:09.850 way
00:02:10.000 I

00:02:10.030 don't
00:02:10.179 get
00:02:10.390 lumps
00:02:10.840 from
00:02:11.080 the
00:02:11.200 corn
00:02:11.980 starch

00:02:12.660 okay
00:02:13.660 you
00:02:13.720 will
00:02:14.020 need
00:02:14.230 three
00:02:14.590 teaspoons
00:02:15.190 of

00:02:15.340 salt
00:02:19.110 and
00:02:20.110 black
00:02:21.060 pepper

00:02:22.690 I
00:02:22.720 just
00:02:23.380 dust
00:02:23.740 the
00:02:23.950 top
00:02:24.130 of
00:02:24.340 it
00:02:24.490 I
00:02:24.520 don't

00:02:25.150 measure
00:02:25.330 it
00:02:25.510 at
00:02:25.720 all

00:02:26.730 and
00:02:28.950 then
00:02:29.950 you'll
00:02:30.100 need
00:02:30.220 one
00:02:30.459 teaspoon
00:02:30.670 of

00:02:32.850 then
00:02:33.850 you're
00:02:33.970 going
00:02:34.090 to
00:02:34.150 whisk
00:02:34.420 that
00:02:34.540 up
00:02:34.690 again

00:02:35.160 you're
00:02:36.160 going
00:02:36.280 to
00:02:36.340 keep
00:02:36.490 whisking
00:02:36.760 until
00:02:37.150 it

00:02:37.480 thickens
00:02:37.630 up
00:02:38.020 and
00:02:38.230 you're
00:02:38.320 not
00:02:38.500 going
00:02:38.650 to
00:02:38.709 want

00:02:38.920 to
00:02:39.070 ignore
00:02:39.730 the
00:02:39.940 stove
00:02:40.180 too
00:02:40.420 much
00:02:40.600 because
00:02:40.959 you

00:02:41.530 will
00:02:41.800 scorch
00:02:42.280 the
00:02:42.459 bottom
00:02:42.730 of
00:02:42.850 your
00:02:42.880 pan
00:02:43.180 I

00:02:43.390 used
00:02:43.630 to
00:02:43.750 do
00:02:43.870 that
00:02:44.020 a

00:02:44.350 when
00:02:44.590 I
00:02:44.620 first

00:02:44.709 started
00:02:45.250 cooking
00:02:45.400 this
00:02:45.730 when
00:02:45.910 I
00:02:46.000 was
00:02:46.060 in

00:02:46.209 college
00:02:46.470 you
00:02:47.470 don't
00:02:47.650 have

00:02:47.890 consistently

00:02:48.310 stir
00:02:48.910 book
00:02:49.600 stir
00:02:50.020 it
00:02:50.170 quite
00:02:50.440 often
00:02:50.680 and
00:02:51.100 it

00:02:51.459 will
00:02:51.580 thicken
00:02:51.820 up
00:02:52.060 on
00:02:52.270 you
00:02:53.820 once
00:02:54.820 your
00:02:55.000 veggies

00:02:55.360 are
00:02:55.510 done
00:02:55.540 you're

00:02:56.290 them
00:02:56.680 to

00:02:57.010 your
00:02:57.040 cream
00:02:58.030 mixture
00:02:58.390 and

00:03:06.550 heat

00:03:06.730 through
00:03:08.130 and
00:03:09.900 then

00:03:11.380 your
00:03:11.620 clams
00:03:12.150 so
00:03:13.150 it
00:03:13.720 doesn't
00:03:14.080 take
00:03:14.200 long
00:03:14.230 for

00:03:14.440 the
00:03:14.739 clams
00:03:15.010 to
00:03:15.489 cook
00:03:15.730 you
00:03:15.910 just
00:03:15.940 are
00:03:16.269 heating

00:03:16.720 them
00:03:16.870 through
00:03:17.110 basically
00:03:17.590 so
00:03:18.570 and
00:03:19.570 if
00:03:19.750 you
00:03:19.930 do

00:03:20.110 use
00:03:20.290 frozen
00:03:20.970 potatoes
00:03:22.260 you
00:03:23.260 might
00:03:23.440 want
00:03:23.650 to

00:03:23.739 use
00:03:23.980 your
00:03:24.250 whole
00:03:24.459 milk
00:03:24.760 instead
00:03:25.120 of
00:03:25.299 the
00:03:25.420 skim

00:03:25.720 milk
00:03:25.930 to
00:03:26.110 help
00:03:26.320 thicken
00:03:26.560 it
00:03:26.890 but
00:03:27.760 it
00:03:27.970 works

00:03:28.209 really
00:03:28.360 good
00:03:28.570 I've
00:03:28.840 done

00:03:31.690 fork

00:03:32.230 because
00:03:32.560 for
00:03:32.980 some
00:03:33.190 reason
00:03:33.519 a
00:03:33.610 metal
00:03:33.850 fork

00:03:34.120 just
00:03:34.180 makes
00:03:34.540 the
00:03:34.780 chowder
