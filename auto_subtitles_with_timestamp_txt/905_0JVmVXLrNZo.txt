00:01:07.729 lot
00:01:08.000 of
00:01:08.180 times
00:01:08.450 where
00:01:08.750 we

00:01:10.070 to
00:01:10.219 room

00:01:10.490 temperature
00:01:10.850 before

00:01:11.630 it
00:01:11.899 with

00:01:12.439 burgers
00:01:12.890 that's
00:01:13.130 not
00:01:13.369 the
00:01:13.549 case
00:01:13.759 you
00:01:14.090 want

00:01:14.360 those
00:01:14.570 little

00:01:17.270 nice
00:01:17.570 and
00:01:17.869 cold
00:01:18.109 so
00:01:18.380 then

00:01:18.590 they
00:01:18.740 don't
00:01:18.859 smear

00:01:20.329 they
00:01:20.450 actually

00:01:20.479 melt

00:01:37.280 can
00:01:37.460 see
00:01:37.789 this
00:01:38.659 deep
