00:00:22.770 by
00:00:22.860 poaching
00:00:23.250 our

00:00:26.009 do
00:00:26.099 all
00:00:26.250 these
00:00:26.430 things

00:00:26.599 pictures
00:00:27.599 on

00:00:29.820 different
00:00:30.300 flavorings
00:00:31.079 and
00:00:31.680 I
00:00:32.009 think

00:00:32.219 the
00:00:32.279 best
00:00:32.430 part
00:00:32.820 a
00:00:32.910 Parmesan
00:00:33.809 cheese
00:00:34.110 basket

00:00:34.910 this
00:00:35.910 doesn't
00:00:36.300 sound
00:00:36.420 like
00:00:36.510 your
00:00:36.780 ordinary

00:00:37.110 chicken
00:00:37.530 Caesar
00:00:37.710 salad
00:00:37.800 no
00:00:38.399 it's
00:00:38.670 ultimate

00:00:39.059 and
00:00:39.180 it
00:00:39.239 starts
00:00:39.600 with
00:00:39.719 our
00:00:39.809 chicken
00:00:40.170 so
00:00:40.289 one

00:00:40.500 chicken
00:00:40.860 breast
00:00:41.100 and
00:00:41.489 we're
00:00:41.610 going
00:00:41.730 to
00:00:41.789 put

00:00:41.940 that
00:00:42.030 into
00:00:42.210 a
00:00:42.300 pan
00:00:42.360 of
00:00:42.900 boiling
00:00:43.079 water
00:00:43.440 but
00:00:44.160 as

00:00:44.280 soon
00:00:44.430 as
00:00:44.460 it
00:00:44.579 goes
00:00:44.670 in
00:00:44.730 turn
00:00:45.510 the
00:00:45.660 heat
00:00:45.810 off

00:00:46.260 why
00:00:46.800 and
00:00:47.130 then
00:00:47.490 let
00:00:47.910 it
00:00:48.120 poach
00:00:48.300 about
00:00:48.570 ten

00:00:48.810 minutes
00:00:48.989 because
00:00:49.310 then
00:00:50.310 it'll
00:00:50.400 be
00:00:50.489 slightly

00:00:50.760 less
00:00:50.970 than
00:00:51.180 boiling
00:00:51.360 which
00:00:51.690 keeps
00:00:51.930 it
00:00:52.020 really

00:00:52.290 moist
00:00:52.440 and
00:00:52.829 succulent

00:00:53.520 yeah
00:00:53.730 I'm
00:00:53.790 just
00:00:53.850 cooking
00:00:54.030 a
00:00:54.239 temperature
00:00:54.570 to

00:00:54.660 get
00:00:54.750 so
00:00:54.989 nice
00:00:55.170 and
00:00:55.290 cool
00:00:55.470 and
00:00:55.530 cooler
00:00:55.829 but
00:00:56.130 it

00:00:56.310 cooked
00:00:56.640 chicken
00:00:57.030 through
00:00:57.300 later
00:00:57.870 on
00:00:58.050 we
00:00:58.140 take

00:00:58.290 out
00:00:58.500 slicing
00:00:58.980 and
00:00:59.130 Charma
00:00:59.550 okay
00:00:59.760 so
00:00:59.820 if
00:00:59.940 you

00:01:00.030 can
00:01:00.180 do
00:01:00.239 that
00:01:00.360 yeah
00:01:00.660 over
00:01:01.350 here
00:01:01.620 I
00:01:01.829 have
00:01:02.190 got
00:01:02.220 a

00:01:02.550 chunk
00:01:02.820 of
00:01:02.910 parmesan
00:01:03.390 and
00:01:03.899 I
00:01:03.989 think
00:01:04.170 this
00:01:04.259 is

00:01:04.350 the
00:01:04.439 best
00:01:04.589 part
00:01:04.829 it's
00:01:05.070 now
00:01:05.250 parmesan
00:01:05.970 Boston

00:01:06.720 what
00:01:07.140 I'm
00:01:07.290 doing
00:01:07.470 is
00:01:07.560 great
00:01:07.740 it's
00:01:08.009 nice
00:01:08.159 and

00:01:08.369 fine
00:01:08.689 grate
00:01:09.689 it
00:01:09.840 into
00:01:09.990 a
00:01:10.049 large
00:01:10.320 disc
00:01:10.799 and
00:01:11.549 then

00:01:11.700 just
00:01:11.850 going
00:01:12.000 to
00:01:12.060 tidy
00:01:12.270 up
00:01:12.360 the
00:01:12.509 edges
00:01:12.750 those

00:01:13.020 bits
00:01:13.229 will
00:01:13.320 burn
00:01:13.530 otherwise
00:01:13.940 so
00:01:14.940 it's
00:01:15.060 gonna

00:01:15.180 be
00:01:15.330 a
00:01:15.360 bomb
00:01:15.659 how
00:01:15.960 do
00:01:16.020 we
00:01:16.170 get
00:01:16.320 the
00:01:16.440 motion
00:01:16.770 that

00:01:17.250 becomes
00:01:17.700 later
00:01:17.880 on
00:01:18.060 so
00:01:18.150 this
00:01:18.240 is
00:01:18.330 gonna
00:01:18.420 go
00:01:18.540 to

00:01:18.600 another
00:01:18.780 yeah
00:01:19.290 180
00:01:19.920 degrees
00:01:20.190 Celsius
00:01:20.610 for

00:01:20.640 four
00:01:21.090 minutes
00:01:21.299 till
00:01:22.020 it's
00:01:22.170 molten
00:01:22.710 the
00:01:22.799 kind

00:01:22.950 of

00:01:23.610 little
00:01:23.880 bit
00:01:23.970 golden
00:01:24.120 then

00:01:24.840 as
00:01:25.020 it
00:01:25.170 comes
00:01:25.320 out
00:01:25.440 it
00:01:25.500 gets
00:01:25.650 draped
00:01:25.979 over
00:01:26.130 a

00:01:26.400 bowl
00:01:26.580 upside
00:01:27.360 down

00:01:28.619 inverted

00:01:28.890 Bowl

00:05:18.780 is

00:05:18.840 that
00:05:18.870 when
00:05:19.680 she
00:05:19.830 said
00:05:19.979 it
00:05:20.009 was
00:05:20.159 because
00:05:20.400 it
00:05:20.520 was

00:05:20.550 light
00:05:20.940 it's
00:05:21.330 not
00:05:21.479 messy
00:05:22.099 it
