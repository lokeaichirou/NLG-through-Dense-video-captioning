00:03:49.630 stick

00:03:51.790 gets
00:03:52.030 a
00:03:52.120 little

00:03:52.290 insane
00:03:53.290 if
00:03:53.590 it
00:03:54.370 does
00:03:54.610 but

00:04:10.200 a
00:04:10.440 lot

00:04:11.160 of
00:04:11.250 different
00:04:11.520 ways
00:04:11.640 to
00:04:11.670 do
00:04:11.910 this
00:04:12.060 actually

00:04:12.330 I've
00:04:12.570 seen
00:04:12.780 several
00:04:13.020 different
00:04:13.410 ways

00:04:13.500 whatever
00:04:13.740 is
00:04:13.980 comfortable
00:04:14.310 but
00:04:14.430 this
00:04:14.580 is
00:04:14.700 a

00:04:14.730 good
00:04:14.910 way
00:04:15.090 okay

00:04:17.640 in
00:04:17.730 the
00:04:17.790 middle
00:04:18.000 so
00:04:18.120 you

00:04:18.180 can
00:04:18.330 start
00:04:18.540 laying
00:04:18.720 in
00:04:18.989 the
00:04:19.080 gigs
00:04:19.320 buy
00:04:20.190 the

00:04:20.250 goods
00:04:20.489 I
00:04:20.700 mean
00:04:20.880 the
00:04:21.239 veggies
00:04:21.600 okay
00:04:21.900 start
00:04:22.410 with

00:04:22.440 the
00:04:22.560 veggies
00:04:22.980 first
00:04:24.020 couple
00:04:25.020 bits
00:04:25.260 of

00:04:25.700 cucumber
00:04:27.470 okay

00:04:28.680 no
00:04:29.340 big
00:04:29.580 deal
00:04:30.440 doesn't
00:04:31.440 have
00:04:31.590 to
00:04:31.650 be
00:04:31.770 perfect

00:04:32.340 and
00:04:32.820 then
00:04:33.420 right
00:04:33.630 over
00:04:33.660 the
00:04:33.960 top
00:04:34.230 of
00:04:34.260 it
00:04:34.640 we're

00:04:35.640 going
00:04:35.790 to
00:04:35.910 start
00:04:36.150 dumping
00:04:36.390 in
00:04:36.720 a
00:04:37.070 spicy
00:04:38.070 tuna

00:04:38.630 now
00:04:39.630 you
00:04:39.690 can't
00:04:40.020 just
00:04:40.110 go
00:04:40.440 as
00:04:40.890 much
00:04:41.160 as
00:04:41.340 you

00:04:41.460 want
00:04:41.700 in
00:04:41.790 there
00:04:42.060 unfortunately
00:04:42.830 you
00:04:43.830 can
00:04:44.010 only

00:04:44.100 roll
00:04:44.430 so
00:04:44.610 much
00:04:44.790 but
00:04:45.000 you
00:04:45.090 want
00:04:45.240 to
00:04:45.300 keep
00:04:45.480 the

00:04:46.320 bulk
00:04:46.620 of
00:04:46.830 it
00:04:47.010 up
00:04:47.250 top
00:04:47.640 because
00:04:47.970 that's
00:04:48.390 just

00:04:48.930 like
00:04:49.050 an
00:04:49.200 ice
00:04:49.350 cream
00:04:49.530 cone
00:04:50.180 where
00:04:51.180 the
00:04:51.510 bulk
00:04:51.720 is

00:04:51.930 going
00:04:52.110 to
00:04:52.200 fit
00:04:52.470 in
00:04:52.800 the
00:04:53.480 let's

00:04:54.660 out
00:04:54.840 down

00:04:55.080 inside
00:04:55.530 the
00:04:55.680 roll
00:04:55.920 okay
00:04:56.400 and
00:04:56.850 that's
00:04:57.030 probably

00:04:57.390 good
00:04:57.570 about

00:04:58.380 right
00:04:58.460 now
00:04:59.460 the

00:04:59.520 tricky
00:04:59.880 part
00:05:00.150 now
00:05:00.330 is
00:05:00.660 doing
00:05:01.350 the
00:05:01.710 roll
00:05:01.950 okay

00:05:02.370 the
00:05:02.580 easiest
00:05:02.700 way
00:05:03.060 is
00:05:03.990 to
00:05:04.230 go
00:05:04.350 ahead
00:05:04.560 and

00:05:14.460 tedious
00:05:14.700 it
00:05:15.000 can
00:05:15.120 be
00:05:15.350 not
00:05:16.350 a
00:05:16.380 big
