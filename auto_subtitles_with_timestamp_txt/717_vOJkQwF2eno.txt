00:00:07.560 nice

00:00:07.830 and
00:00:07.980 steamy
00:00:08.189 so
00:00:09.059 our
00:00:09.150 first
00:00:09.300 step
00:00:09.420 is
00:00:09.599 to
00:00:09.809 make

00:00:10.170 the
00:00:10.380 dough
00:00:10.620 it
00:00:10.920 is
00:00:11.429 just
00:00:11.610 a
00:00:11.700 very
00:00:11.730 simple

00:00:12.389 though
00:00:12.570 it's
00:00:12.780 just
00:00:12.929 your
00:00:13.080 basic
00:00:13.349 dough
00:00:13.769 recipe

00:00:14.309 doesn't
00:00:15.120 have

00:00:15.360 lot
00:00:15.509 of
00:00:15.540 flavor
00:00:15.839 but
00:00:16.170 it
00:00:16.320 gets

00:00:16.440 the
00:00:16.590 job
00:00:16.680 done
00:00:16.940 so
00:00:17.940 our
00:00:18.090 first
00:00:18.270 step
00:00:18.449 is
00:00:18.600 to
00:00:18.990 add

00:00:19.170 some
00:00:19.560 flour

00:00:20.220 bowl
00:00:20.279 you
00:00:21.180 don't
00:00:21.359 need

00:00:21.539 sift
00:00:21.750 this
00:00:21.869 flower
00:00:22.140 anything
00:00:22.590 you
00:00:22.710 can
00:00:22.830 just

00:00:23.039 dump
00:00:23.609 it
00:00:23.760 in
00:00:23.910 straight
00:00:24.300 from
00:00:24.420 the
00:00:24.600 bag
00:00:24.810 so

00:00:25.650 throw
00:00:25.980 that
00:00:26.130 flour
00:00:26.400 in

00:00:29.400 flour
00:00:29.970 you
00:00:30.269 don't
00:00:30.449 need
00:00:30.539 to

00:00:30.599 use
00:00:30.720 any
00:00:30.779 special
00:00:31.320 high-gluten
00:00:31.650 flour

00:00:32.450 and
00:00:33.450 our
00:00:34.440 next
00:00:34.710 step
00:00:34.890 is
00:00:35.070 to
00:00:35.100 add
00:00:35.250 half

00:00:35.880 of
00:00:36.090 warm
00:00:36.719 water
00:00:36.870 and
00:00:38.750 now
00:00:39.750 just
00:00:39.960 using

00:00:40.290 floured

00:00:44.100 together
00:00:44.309 into
00:00:44.640 a
00:00:44.670 ball
00:00:44.940 then
00:00:45.239 you're
00:00:45.360 going

00:00:45.480 to
00:00:45.690 turn

00:00:49.860 up

00:00:50.129 about
00:00:50.789 three
00:00:51.210 minutes
00:00:51.360 into
00:00:51.600 the
00:00:51.750 kneading

00:00:52.050 this
00:00:52.170 is
00:00:52.350 how
00:00:52.469 you
00:00:52.530 need
00:00:52.800 it
00:00:52.920 you
00:00:53.100 just
00:00:53.520 kind
00:00:53.730 of

00:00:53.789 pick
00:00:54.030 it

00:00:54.719 and
00:00:54.870 smoosh
00:00:55.170 it

00:00:55.199 with
00:00:55.320 your
00:00:55.500 hand
00:00:55.710 and
00:00:56.610 you're
00:00:56.760 just
00:00:56.850 going

00:01:00.149 and
00:01:00.350 to
00:01:01.350 make
00:01:01.500 the

00:01:01.680 wrappers
00:01:02.070 there
00:01:02.370 are
00:01:02.489 two
00:01:02.609 different
00:01:02.879 methods

00:01:03.210 i'm
00:01:03.390 going
00:01:03.510 to
00:01:03.600 show
00:01:03.719 you
00:01:03.890 two
00:01:04.890 different
00:01:04.920 easy

00:01:05.309 ways
00:01:05.549 this
00:01:06.390 is
00:01:06.570 my
00:01:06.720 favorite
00:01:07.049 one
00:01:07.080 right
00:01:07.200 here

00:01:07.590 you
00:01:08.100 roll
00:01:08.310 it
00:01:08.430 out
00:01:08.520 with
00:01:08.640 a
00:01:08.670 rolling
00:01:08.880 pin
00:01:09.090 then

00:01:09.479 cut
00:01:09.720 it
00:01:09.840 with
00:01:09.930 like
00:01:10.170 a
00:01:10.200 cookie
00:01:10.530 cutter
00:01:10.650 or
00:01:10.920 a

00:01:10.979 cup
00:01:11.990 but
00:01:12.990 this
00:01:13.229 does
00:01:13.530 take
00:01:13.830 a
00:01:13.860 while
00:01:13.979 and
00:01:14.460 this

00:01:14.700 is
00:01:14.880 a
00:01:14.909 kind
00:01:15.390 of
00:01:15.479 tedious
00:01:15.689 work
00:01:15.990 so
00:01:16.979 you're
00:01:17.070 just

00:01:17.220 go
00:01:17.400 on
00:01:17.549 a
00:01:17.580 roll
00:01:17.850 it

00:01:19.380 and
00:01:19.860 that
00:01:19.979 took
00:01:20.130 me
00:01:20.280 about
00:01:20.490 20

00:01:21.150 25
00:01:21.330 minutes
00:01:21.810 so
00:01:22.140 you're
00:01:22.830 really
00:01:22.920 going
00:01:23.100 to

00:01:23.159 want
00:01:23.220 to
00:01:23.400 roll
00:01:23.520 it
00:01:23.640 out
00:01:23.729 until
00:01:24.060 it's
00:01:24.240 like
00:01:24.479 this

00:01:24.990 thickness
00:01:25.409 very
00:01:25.979 thin

00:01:28.189 so
00:01:29.189 I'm
00:01:29.369 just
00:01:29.520 giving
00:01:29.759 a
00:01:29.820 nice

00:01:29.970 another
00:01:30.600 role
00:01:30.840 here
00:01:31.110 to
00:01:31.229 make
00:01:31.380 sure

00:01:31.530 everything
00:01:31.860 is
00:01:31.890 all
00:01:32.070 even
00:01:32.280 texture
00:01:32.759 or
00:01:32.970 not

00:01:33.240 textured
00:01:33.600 even
00:01:34.020 thickness
00:01:34.200 sorry

00:01:34.770 that

00:01:35.600 that's
00:01:36.600 looking
00:01:36.750 great
00:01:38.900 so
00:01:39.900 our
00:01:40.350 next
00:01:40.650 step
00:01:40.799 is

00:01:41.100 to
00:01:41.130 take
00:01:41.369 a
00:01:41.729 cup

00:01:44.280 cut
00:01:45.149 out
00:01:45.270 circles

00:01:46.200 and
00:01:46.710 the
00:01:46.799 reason
00:01:47.070 you
00:01:47.130 use
00:01:47.189 a
00:01:47.250 cup
00:01:47.490 not
00:01:47.700 a
00:01:47.729 knife

00:01:47.970 is
00:01:48.149 so
00:01:48.270 they
00:01:48.360 all
00:01:48.479 stay
00:01:48.689 at

00:02:30.090 this
00:02:30.120 out
00:02:30.420 the
00:02:30.630 reason
00:02:30.870 I
00:02:30.930 don't
00:02:31.110 like

00:02:31.230 this
00:02:31.380 too
00:02:31.530 much
00:02:31.710 it
00:02:31.860 because
00:02:31.950 it
00:02:32.190 can
00:02:32.310 either

00:02:32.460 get
00:02:32.580 too
00:02:32.730 long
00:02:33.000 or
00:02:33.180 too
00:02:33.210 wide
00:02:33.540 it's
00:02:34.320 hard
00:02:34.500 to

00:02:34.560 get
00:02:34.680 it
00:02:34.830 into
00:02:34.950 a
00:02:35.070 circle
00:02:35.550 like
00:02:35.580 you
00:02:35.820 want
00:02:36.770 but

00:02:37.770 just
00:02:38.010 do
00:02:38.160 the
00:02:38.280 process
00:02:38.670 and
00:02:38.820 I'm
00:02:38.940 as
00:02:39.090 I'm
00:02:39.390 doing

00:02:39.570 it
00:02:39.750 here
00:02:39.990 I
00:02:44.720 usually
00:02:45.720 just
00:02:45.750 roll
00:02:46.500 it
00:02:46.590 out

00:02:46.709 really
00:02:47.250 thin
00:02:47.280 and
00:02:47.700 then
00:02:47.850 cut
00:02:48.090 it
00:02:48.209 with
00:02:48.300 the
