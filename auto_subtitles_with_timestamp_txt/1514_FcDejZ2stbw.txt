00:00:06.330 also
00:00:06.750 the
00:00:07.350 one

00:00:07.799 was

00:00:07.890 voted
00:00:08.069 most
00:00:08.429 likely
00:00:08.519 to
00:00:08.790 kill
00:00:09.090 you
00:00:09.210 it's
00:00:09.660 the

00:00:09.780 eggs
00:00:09.929 benedict
00:00:10.440 and
00:00:10.710 it's

00:00:18.630 there's
00:00:19.020 a
00:00:19.080 lot
00:00:19.230 of
00:00:19.260 controversy
00:00:19.830 about

00:00:19.920 where
00:00:20.189 it
00:00:20.250 was
00:00:20.340 invented
00:00:20.490 but
00:00:21.270 I'm
00:00:21.600 really

00:00:22.109 convinced
00:00:22.560 that
00:00:22.590 it
00:00:22.800 was
00:00:22.890 probably
00:00:23.369 right

00:00:23.820 here
00:00:24.119 in
00:00:24.269 the

00:00:43.080 separate

00:00:43.650 our
00:00:43.830 eggs
00:00:43.860 and
00:00:44.430 just

00:00:52.440 scrambled

00:00:52.800 eggs
00:00:52.920 later
00:00:53.100 so
00:00:53.280 you
00:00:53.370 don't
00:00:53.489 have
00:00:53.610 to
00:00:53.820 waste

00:00:54.000 them
00:00:54.239 and
00:00:54.480 then
00:00:55.140 I'm
00:00:55.350 gonna
00:00:55.440 add
00:00:55.559 a
00:00:55.590 little
00:00:55.680 bit

00:00:55.890 of
00:00:56.040 water
00:00:56.420 and
00:00:57.420 I've
00:00:57.600 got
00:00:57.780 this
00:00:57.989 I'm
00:00:58.410 just
00:00:59.100 a

00:00:59.160 bowl
00:00:59.400 about
00:01:00.239 an
00:01:00.570 inch
00:01:00.720 and
00:01:00.870 a
00:01:00.900 half
00:01:00.960 of
00:01:01.230 water

00:01:01.440 down
00:01:02.010 there
00:01:02.250 and
00:01:02.430 the
00:01:02.489 pan
00:01:02.670 underneath
00:01:03.770 so
00:01:04.770 I'm

00:01:04.890 kind
00:01:05.129 of
00:01:05.190 I've
00:01:05.400 got
00:01:05.580 a
00:01:05.610 rigged
00:01:06.300 up
00:01:07.040 double

00:01:08.040 boiler
00:01:08.340 but
00:01:08.550 I
00:01:08.700 like
00:01:08.850 this
00:01:09.030 actually
00:01:09.390 better

00:01:09.540 than
00:01:09.690 double
00:01:09.930 boiler
00:01:10.229 because
00:01:10.380 see
00:01:10.740 this
00:01:10.890 bowl

00:01:11.130 has
00:01:11.340 a
00:01:11.399 nice
00:01:12.210 round
00:01:12.540 bottom
00:01:12.960 so
00:01:13.170 it's
00:01:13.320 gonna

00:01:13.520 round
00:01:14.520 bottom
00:01:14.759 so
00:01:15.420 it's
00:01:15.750 gonna
00:01:15.990 make
00:01:16.229 it

00:01:16.380 easier
00:01:16.740 for
00:01:16.770 me
00:01:17.009 to
00:01:17.040 stir
00:01:17.700 it
00:01:17.820 up
00:01:17.910 really
00:01:18.030 well

00:01:18.210 so
00:01:19.020 once
00:01:19.200 the
00:01:19.350 water
00:01:19.380 and
00:01:19.920 the
00:01:20.009 yolks
00:01:20.250 are

00:01:20.610 incorporated
00:01:21.619 kind
00:01:22.619 of
00:01:22.740 over
00:01:22.979 a
00:01:23.220 medium
00:01:23.670 heat

00:01:23.880 we're
00:01:24.119 just
00:01:24.270 gonna
00:01:24.979 cook
00:01:25.979 these
00:01:26.190 over
00:01:26.460 some

00:01:26.640 simmering
00:01:26.940 water
00:01:27.290 for
00:01:28.290 maybe
00:01:28.590 five
00:01:29.490 minutes

00:01:29.670 or
00:01:30.000 so
00:01:30.180 until
00:01:30.450 they
00:01:30.750 start
00:01:31.050 to
00:01:31.140 thicken
00:01:31.320 up
00:01:31.530 a

00:01:31.680 little
00:01:31.860 bit
00:01:36.200 okay
00:01:37.200 now
00:01:37.560 you
00:01:37.770 can
00:01:37.800 kind
00:01:38.130 of
00:01:38.160 see

00:01:38.340 when
00:01:38.520 I
00:01:38.550 scrape
00:01:38.880 the
00:01:39.030 sides
00:01:39.270 it
00:01:39.720 leaves
00:01:39.930 a

00:01:40.140 trail
00:01:40.580 like
00:01:41.580 the
00:01:41.700 whisk
00:01:41.910 is
00:01:42.060 able
00:01:42.330 to
00:01:42.420 kind
00:01:42.569 of

00:01:42.630 cut
00:01:42.899 through
00:01:43.580 the
00:01:44.580 foamy
00:01:44.850 stuff
00:01:45.209 so
00:01:45.810 that's

00:01:45.959 good
00:01:46.560 that
00:01:46.860 means
00:01:46.890 we
00:01:47.369 are
00:01:47.569 in
00:01:48.569 the
00:01:48.840 right
00:01:49.080 time

00:01:49.890 and
00:01:50.190 place
00:01:51.619 and
00:01:52.619 then
00:01:52.830 I've
00:01:52.950 got
00:01:53.190 some
00:01:53.520 melted

00:01:53.880 butter
00:01:54.240 here
00:01:54.479 I
00:01:54.509 just
00:01:54.750 melted
00:01:55.050 it
00:01:55.140 in
00:01:55.229 the

00:01:55.289 microwave
00:01:56.090 my
00:01:57.090 little
00:01:57.270 Pyrex
00:01:57.899 deal
00:01:58.140 so
00:01:58.410 then
00:01:58.560 I

00:01:58.619 can
00:01:58.860 pour
00:01:59.340 it
00:01:59.429 in
00:01:59.959 so
00:02:00.959 this
00:02:01.110 is
00:02:01.170 where
00:02:01.470 the

00:02:01.619 whisking
00:02:02.009 is
00:02:02.130 super-important
00:02:03.530 whisk
00:02:04.530 it

00:02:04.740 constantly
00:02:05.780 I'm
00:02:06.780 just
00:02:06.959 gonna
00:02:07.080 have
00:02:07.229 trickle

00:02:07.590 this
00:02:07.709 butter
00:02:08.369 in
00:02:08.580 there
00:02:08.789 a
00:02:09.200 little
00:02:10.200 by
00:02:10.289 little

00:02:10.700 basically
00:02:11.700 what
00:02:11.880 we're
00:02:12.000 making
00:02:12.240 it
00:02:12.360 is
00:02:12.510 an

00:02:12.690 emulsion
00:02:12.959 sauce
00:02:13.290 so
00:02:13.560 it's
00:02:13.709 like
00:02:13.830 if
00:02:14.010 you
00:02:14.130 ever

00:02:14.160 made
00:02:14.520 a
00:02:14.790 loli
00:02:15.420 or
00:02:15.540 mayonnaise
00:02:15.840 it's
00:02:16.080 the
00:02:16.200 same

00:02:16.380 process
00:02:16.770 except
00:02:17.190 using
00:02:17.520 oil
00:02:17.880 instead
00:02:18.270 of

00:02:18.330 butter
00:02:19.250 so
00:02:20.690 this
00:02:21.690 way
00:02:21.870 is
00:02:21.930 a
00:02:21.989 lot
00:02:22.170 healthier

00:02:24.290 just
00:02:25.290 make
00:02:25.470 sure
00:02:25.500 you're
00:02:25.830 getting
00:02:25.980 the
00:02:26.250 sides

00:02:27.920 and
00:02:28.920 now
00:02:28.980 when
00:02:29.700 you
00:02:29.790 start
00:02:30.000 adding
00:02:30.090 the
00:02:30.239 butter

00:02:30.360 is
00:02:30.569 when
00:02:30.720 you
00:02:30.810 see
00:02:30.989 it
00:02:31.110 really
00:02:31.349 start
00:02:31.620 to
00:02:31.709 kind

00:02:31.890 of
00:02:31.950 thicken
00:02:33.230 and
00:02:34.230 that's
00:02:34.380 that

00:02:34.620 emulsification
00:02:35.220 process
00:02:35.610 happening
00:02:36.569 when

00:02:36.720 you're
00:02:36.840 getting
00:02:36.930 the
00:02:37.459 egg
00:02:38.459 and
00:02:38.670 the
00:02:38.760 butter
00:02:39.290 so

00:02:40.290 that
00:02:40.470 they
00:02:40.620 make
00:02:40.800 an
00:02:40.950 acquaintance
00:02:41.660 and
00:02:42.660 they

00:02:42.810 form
00:02:43.140 droplets
00:02:43.470 within
00:02:43.950 droplets
00:02:44.690 and
00:02:45.690 decide

00:02:46.080 to
00:02:46.200 be
00:02:46.319 good
00:02:46.469 friends

00:02:48.610 so
00:02:49.610 the
00:02:49.700 last
00:02:49.880 of
00:02:50.030 the
00:02:50.090 butters
00:02:50.300 going
00:02:50.600 in
00:02:50.720 I

00:02:50.990 did
00:02:51.470 start
00:02:51.740 to
00:02:51.830 get
00:02:51.920 a
00:02:51.980 few
00:02:52.220 little
00:02:52.370 lumps

00:02:52.640 because
00:02:53.030 I
00:02:53.300 had
00:02:53.420 my
00:02:53.570 heat
00:02:53.780 too
00:02:53.960 high
00:02:53.990 so
00:02:54.680 let

00:02:55.190 that
00:02:55.220 be
00:02:55.460 a
00:02:55.490 lesson
00:02:55.550 to
00:02:55.820 you
00:02:56.230 it's
00:02:57.230 a
00:02:57.350 slow
00:02:57.620 and

00:02:57.770 patient
00:02:57.950 process
00:02:59.080 much
00:03:00.080 like
00:03:00.110 many
00:03:00.650 things
00:03:00.860 in

00:03:01.100 life
00:03:01.130 that
00:03:01.310 are
00:03:01.610 worth

00:04:00.770 butter
00:04:00.950 I
