00:06:20.440 you
00:06:20.650 start

00:06:20.949 cooking

00:06:23.349 since
00:06:23.560 you
00:06:23.919 know
00:06:24.009 pretty
00:06:24.190 much
00:06:24.250 as
00:06:24.460 long
00:06:24.610 as

00:06:24.759 I've
00:06:24.909 been
00:06:24.940 cooking
00:06:25.330 I
00:06:25.570 I
00:06:25.599 love
00:06:26.139 to
00:06:26.259 cook
00:06:26.440 and

00:06:26.500 I've
00:06:27.190 always
00:06:27.550 been
00:06:27.880 a
00:06:27.940 fan
00:06:28.210 of
00:06:28.479 a
00:06:28.840 beer
00:06:29.199 that

00:06:29.229 the
00:06:29.530 flavors
00:06:29.770 of
00:06:30.009 beer
00:06:30.370 when
00:06:30.880 I
00:06:30.909 moved
00:06:31.180 back

00:06:31.240 from
00:06:31.360 Germany
00:06:32.110 in
00:06:32.979 the
00:06:33.099 mid
00:06:33.250 80s
00:06:33.280 I
00:06:33.759 couldn't

00:06:34.090 find
00:06:34.300 a
00:06:34.449 beer
00:06:34.840 that
00:06:34.990 I
00:06:35.020 really
00:06:35.349 thought
00:06:35.530 was
00:06:35.740 a

00:06:35.770 decent
00:06:36.099 beer
00:06:36.550 after
00:06:37.120 living
00:06:37.330 in
00:06:37.449 the
00:06:37.539 land
00:06:37.720 of

00:06:37.900 beer
00:06:38.169 kind
00:06:38.409 of
00:06:38.530 thing
00:06:38.710 so
00:06:39.220 I
00:06:39.250 really
00:06:39.940 started

00:06:40.210 developing
00:06:40.630 my
00:06:40.750 palate
00:06:41.169 over
00:06:41.380 there
00:06:41.560 and
00:06:41.770 then

00:06:42.130 in
00:06:42.250 traveling
00:06:42.669 all
00:06:42.789 over
00:06:42.820 the
00:06:43.030 world
00:06:43.120 have

00:06:43.449 experienced
00:06:43.990 some
00:06:44.080 really
00:06:44.349 great
00:06:44.500 beers
00:06:44.770 some

00:06:45.039 really
00:06:45.250 great
00:06:45.400 foods

00:06:46.110 and
00:06:46.170 it
00:06:46.290 just
00:06:46.440 made
00:06:46.590 sense
00:06:46.800 to
00:06:46.950 start

00:06:47.220 combining
00:06:47.820 them
00:06:48.470 after
00:06:49.470 seeing
00:06:49.710 other
00:06:49.830 people

00:06:50.160 doing
00:06:50.400 this
00:06:50.490 and
00:06:50.700 a
00:06:50.730 lot
00:06:50.820 of
00:06:50.880 the
00:06:51.000 pubs
00:06:51.240 and

00:06:51.450 like
00:06:51.570 that
00:06:51.780 beer
00:06:52.530 has
00:06:52.620 been
00:06:52.680 around
00:06:52.980 for

00:06:53.310 roughly
00:06:53.880 10,000
00:06:54.630 years
00:06:54.840 and
00:06:55.050 it's
00:06:55.140 been
00:06:55.230 an

00:06:55.620 integral
00:06:55.800 part
00:06:56.010 of
00:06:56.370 cooking
00:06:56.790 for
00:06:57.600 almost
00:06:58.110 as

00:06:58.320 long
00:06:58.350 especially
00:06:58.890 in
00:06:59.280 the
00:06:59.760 Middle
00:07:00.180 Ages
00:07:00.270 and

00:07:00.960 even
00:07:01.500 in
00:07:01.620 colonial
00:07:02.400 America
00:07:02.910 beer
00:07:03.720 was

00:07:03.900 something
00:07:04.530 healthy
00:07:05.130 and
00:07:05.160 healthful
00:07:05.940 to
00:07:06.090 drink

00:07:06.360 it
00:07:06.570 was
00:07:06.690 much
00:07:06.930 safer
00:07:07.170 than
00:07:07.470 the
00:07:07.590 water
00:07:07.770 and
00:07:08.010 you

00:07:08.460 get
00:07:08.580 a
00:07:08.610 lot
00:07:08.760 of
00:07:08.790 flavors
00:07:09.330 and
00:07:09.360 character
00:07:10.320 that

00:07:10.560 you
00:07:10.980 know
00:07:11.070 water
00:07:11.310 something
00:07:11.850 like
00:07:12.000 that

00:07:12.210 wouldn't
00:07:12.600 necessarily
00:07:12.690 bring
00:07:13.490 and
00:07:14.490 how
00:07:14.730 many

00:07:14.790 different
00:07:15.180 flavors
00:07:15.480 of
00:07:15.780 beer
00:07:16.230 do
00:07:16.350 you
00:07:16.470 think

00:07:16.710 you've
00:07:16.920 had
00:07:17.010 oh
00:07:17.580 I
00:07:17.940 I
00:07:18.600 would
00:07:19.080 lose
00:07:19.350 track
00:07:19.680 I

00:07:19.830 know
00:07:19.890 I've
00:07:20.130 been
00:07:20.160 to
00:07:20.520 about

00:07:23.910 brewpubs

00:07:23.940 around
00:07:24.690 the
00:07:24.780 world
00:07:26.000 multiply
00:07:27.000 that
00:07:27.180 times

00:07:27.450 probably
00:07:27.960 six
00:07:28.290 to
00:07:28.350 seven
00:07:28.740 beers
00:07:28.890 at
00:07:29.130 each

00:07:29.250 place
00:07:30.020 and
00:07:31.020 that's
00:07:31.230 not
00:07:31.440 counting
00:07:31.680 the

00:07:31.920 commercial
00:07:32.400 beers
