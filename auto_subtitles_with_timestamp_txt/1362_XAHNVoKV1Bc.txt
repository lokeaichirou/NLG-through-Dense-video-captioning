00:02:00.520 bottom
00:02:00.789 of

00:02:02.139 seven
00:02:02.499 inches
00:02:02.649 across
00:02:03.009 because
00:02:03.369 you
00:02:03.579 have

00:02:03.700 to
00:02:03.819 fit
00:02:04.029 all
00:02:04.270 the
00:02:04.419 meatballs
00:02:04.749 in
00:02:04.929 there

00:02:05.829 layer
00:02:06.340 so

00:02:07.479 right
00:02:07.630 so
00:02:08.289 now
00:02:08.439 we're
00:02:08.649 gonna

00:02:08.739 make
00:02:08.950 the
00:02:09.069 sauce
00:02:09.250 while
00:02:09.549 the
00:02:09.759 bread
00:02:10.390 crumbs

00:02:10.689 soak
00:02:10.959 and
00:02:11.849 we're
00:02:12.849 going
00:02:12.969 to
00:02:13.030 saute

00:02:14.020 clove
00:02:14.320 of
00:02:14.470 garlic
00:02:14.530 which
00:02:14.980 I
00:02:15.100 have
00:02:15.280 in
00:02:15.430 here
00:02:15.670 see

00:02:16.090 that
00:02:16.240 I
00:02:16.270 already
00:02:16.510 suppressed
00:02:16.810 it
00:02:17.110 in
00:02:17.950 a

00:02:18.160 tablespoon
00:02:18.520 of
00:02:18.880 olive
00:02:19.090 oils
00:02:19.480 so
00:02:19.600 I'm
00:02:19.660 going
00:02:19.780 to

00:02:19.840 put
00:02:20.020 the
00:02:20.140 olive
00:02:20.440 oil
00:02:20.530 in
00:02:20.740 here
00:02:21.040 all

00:02:22.000 approximate
00:02:22.780 just
00:02:22.990 sauce
00:02:23.200 you
00:02:23.500 know
00:02:23.620 but
00:02:23.830 a

00:02:23.860 tablespoon
00:02:24.460 but
00:02:25.180 the
00:02:25.270 reason
00:02:25.540 that
00:02:25.630 you
00:02:25.750 want

00:02:25.870 to
00:02:25.990 use
00:02:26.080 a
00:02:26.110 generous
00:02:26.560 amount
00:02:26.770 of
00:02:26.890 oil
00:02:27.040 is

00:02:27.220 because
00:02:27.580 the
00:02:28.120 oil
00:02:28.330 helps
00:02:28.810 the
00:02:29.020 lycopene
00:02:29.380 and

00:02:29.620 the
00:02:29.680 tomatoes
00:02:30.130 absorb
00:02:30.550 better
00:02:30.790 into
00:02:30.970 your

00:02:31.090 system
00:02:31.420 it's
00:02:31.540 a
00:02:31.660 good
