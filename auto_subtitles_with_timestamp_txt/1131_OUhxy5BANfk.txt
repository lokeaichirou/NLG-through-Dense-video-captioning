00:03:05.170 it
00:03:05.319 right
00:03:05.530 in
00:03:05.590 the
00:03:05.860 center
00:03:06.340 there

00:03:06.370 may
00:03:07.209 be
00:03:07.239 a
00:03:07.390 little
00:03:07.690 more
00:03:07.900 there
00:03:08.200 right
00:03:09.130 in
00:03:09.310 the

00:03:09.340 center
00:03:09.459 and
00:03:10.620 then
00:03:11.620 I'm
00:03:12.160 going
00:03:12.400 to
00:03:12.459 cover
00:03:13.180 this

00:03:13.420 again
00:03:13.810 for
00:03:14.380 about
00:03:14.799 you
00:03:15.670 know
00:03:15.790 I
00:03:16.060 would
00:03:16.299 say
00:03:16.540 it

00:03:16.600 ten
00:03:17.200 seconds
00:03:17.739 or
00:03:17.859 so
00:03:18.069 and
00:03:18.609 I'm
00:03:18.760 still
00:03:19.030 waiting

00:03:19.209 on
00:03:19.540 that
00:03:19.600 to
00:03:20.109 turn
00:03:20.350 a
00:03:20.380 little
00:03:20.500 more
00:03:20.769 nice
00:03:21.639 and

00:03:21.910 brown
00:03:22.150 and
00:03:22.510 the
00:03:22.720 basic
00:03:23.079 he
00:03:23.319 can
00:03:23.560 nicely
00:03:23.859 mold

00:03:24.340 in
00:03:24.549 it
00:03:24.700 and
00:03:24.910 once
00:03:25.810 that
00:03:26.019 is
00:03:26.079 done
00:03:26.760 okay
00:03:27.760 so
00:03:28.000 I

00:03:28.450 think
00:03:29.410 it's
00:03:29.680 ready
00:03:29.889 to
00:03:30.010 come
00:03:30.340 out
00:03:30.519 and
00:03:30.850 what
00:03:31.780 do

00:03:31.870 you
00:03:31.930 do
00:03:32.049 is
00:03:32.290 you
00:03:32.530 just
00:03:32.560 take
00:03:32.799 this
00:03:33.190 those
00:03:34.090 I

00:03:35.620 sides
00:03:36.010 and
00:03:36.250 off
00:03:36.400 and

00:03:36.609 that's
00:03:37.030 the
00:03:37.180 technique
00:03:37.569 what
00:03:38.019 you
00:03:38.200 use
00:03:38.470 for

00:03:38.889 spraying
