00:00:08.220 super
00:00:09.059 easy
00:00:09.179 to

00:00:21.720 eat
00:00:21.990 it
00:00:22.109 because
00:00:22.560 of

00:03:06.730 to
00:03:06.790 break
00:03:07.000 this
00:03:07.150 down
00:03:07.209 this

00:03:07.900 does
00:03:08.430 get
00:03:09.430 smaller
00:03:09.730 kind
00:03:10.000 of
00:03:10.060 like
00:03:10.150 when
00:03:10.269 you

00:03:10.360 cook
00:03:10.540 kale
00:03:11.260 or
00:03:11.440 spinach

00:03:12.430 greens
00:03:12.760 it

00:03:13.269 just
00:03:13.450 starts
00:03:13.660 to
00:03:13.810 break
00:03:13.989 down

00:03:15.239 mmm
00:03:16.239 so

00:03:19.060 the
00:03:19.180 other
00:03:19.269 half

00:03:19.980 but
00:03:20.980 I
00:03:21.489 might

00:03:22.510 I'm
00:03:22.660 just

00:03:23.110 start

00:03:23.500 with
00:03:23.680 this
00:03:23.980 massage
00:03:24.730 it
00:03:25.030 and
00:03:25.720 then
00:03:25.959 I'll
00:03:26.079 put

00:03:26.319 it
00:03:26.440 in
00:03:26.650 to
00:03:27.549 the
00:03:27.700 mason
00:03:28.060 jar
00:03:28.360 and
00:03:28.690 if
00:03:28.870 I
00:03:28.959 need

00:03:29.110 more
00:03:29.410 then
00:03:29.680 I'll
00:03:29.799 do
00:03:29.950 the
00:03:30.099 other
00:03:30.250 half
00:03:31.590 fact

00:03:32.590 measurements
00:03:33.489 very
00:03:33.700 often
00:03:34.090 when
00:03:34.209 I'm
00:03:34.329 cooking

00:03:35.040 so
00:03:43.260 you
00:03:44.260 should
00:03:44.530 start
00:03:44.920 off
00:03:45.069 with
00:03:46.049 about
00:03:47.049 a

00:03:47.200 tablespoon
00:03:50.370 no
00:03:51.370 fault

00:03:52.470 this
00:03:53.470 is
00:03:53.620 sea
00:03:53.859 salt
00:03:54.250 um
00:03:54.459 I'd
00:03:55.420 never
00:03:55.660 used
00:03:55.959 me

00:03:56.319 Ayodhya
00:03:56.859 salt
00:03:57.250 I
00:03:57.489 mean
00:03:57.639 of
00:03:57.730 that
00:03:57.850 crap
00:03:58.319 so
00:03:59.319 I'm

00:03:59.410 gonna
00:03:59.620 sprinkle
00:03:59.859 this
00:04:00.130 in
00:04:00.209 and
00:04:01.209 I'm
00:04:01.900 gonna

00:04:02.079 start
00:04:02.530 massaging
00:04:03.130 a
00:04:03.579 little
00:04:03.819 bit
00:04:05.609 the
00:04:06.609 last

00:04:06.790 few
00:04:07.030 times
00:04:07.209 we
00:04:07.510 made
00:04:07.690 this
00:04:07.959 we're
00:04:08.410 using
00:04:08.440 a

00:04:09.450 recipe
00:04:10.450 that
00:04:11.040 called
00:04:12.269 for
00:04:14.010 some
00:04:15.010 beet
00:04:15.190 juice

00:04:15.220 and
00:04:15.790 I
00:04:16.510 think
00:04:16.750 that
00:04:16.870 that
00:04:17.019 just
00:04:17.049 helps
00:04:17.760 speed

00:04:18.760 up
00:04:18.820 the
00:04:19.269 fermenting
00:04:19.810 process
00:04:19.840 a
00:04:20.349 little
00:04:20.590 bit

00:04:22.160 doing
00:04:23.030 that
00:04:23.210 today
00:04:23.770 it's
00:04:24.770 just
00:04:24.950 an
00:04:25.070 extra
00:04:25.400 step

00:04:39.490 I
00:04:41.500 didn't
00:04:42.500 cut
00:04:42.740 my
00:04:43.010 cabbage
00:04:43.730 up
00:04:43.970 very
00:04:44.780 much
00:04:44.840 for

00:04:45.350 any
00:04:45.500 pieces
00:04:46.120 because
00:04:47.120 the
00:04:47.390 knife
00:04:47.600 that
00:04:47.840 I
00:04:47.930 have

00:04:48.140 it's
00:04:48.440 extremely
00:04:49.130 extremely
00:04:49.940 dull
00:04:52.510 but
00:04:53.510 when

00:04:53.870 they're
00:04:54.050 a
00:04:54.080 bit
00:04:54.260 smaller
00:04:54.710 it
00:04:55.520 obviously
00:04:56.320 helps

00:04:58.870 quite
00:04:59.870 a
00:04:59.900 bit
00:05:06.220 you'll
00:05:07.220 know
00:05:07.340 it's
00:05:07.520 starting
00:05:07.640 to

00:05:07.790 break
00:05:08.060 down
00:05:08.300 when
00:05:08.740 it's
00:05:09.740 still
00:05:10.190 a
00:05:10.460 little
00:05:10.760 more

00:05:11.000 liquidy
00:05:13.600 and
00:05:14.600 this
00:05:14.720 is
00:05:14.870 about
00:05:15.110 as
00:05:15.710 labour
00:05:22.300 you

00:05:23.300 can
00:05:23.450 see
00:05:23.960 this
00:05:24.340 it's
00:05:25.340 starting
00:05:25.850 to
00:05:26.780 listen
00:05:27.080 a

00:05:27.350 little
00:05:27.530 bit

00:05:35.110 you
00:05:35.830 smell
00:05:36.099 like
00:05:36.449 these
00:05:37.500 cabbage
00:05:38.819 same
00:05:39.819 idea

00:05:40.180 is
00:05:40.330 if
00:05:40.689 you're
00:05:40.870 doing
00:05:40.990 like
00:05:41.289 a
00:05:41.379 raw
00:05:41.560 kale
00:05:41.979 salad

00:05:42.669 you
00:05:43.120 have
00:05:43.300 to
00:05:43.560 use
00:05:44.560 a
00:05:44.590 little
00:05:44.860 lemon
00:05:45.129 juice
00:05:45.520 or

00:05:45.789 simply
00:05:46.180 a
00:05:46.770 pulp
00:05:47.770 massage
00:05:48.250 and
00:05:48.580 break
00:05:48.819 it
00:05:49.000 down

00:05:50.099 I've
00:05:51.099 never
00:05:51.400 used
00:05:51.669 lemon
00:05:52.030 in
00:05:52.330 this
00:05:52.479 recipe
00:05:52.930 and

00:05:53.110 I
00:05:53.199 don't
00:05:53.259 know
00:05:53.620 how
00:05:54.280 it
00:05:54.460 would
00:05:54.610 affect
00:05:55.020 the

00:05:56.020 flavor
00:05:56.259 of
00:05:56.500 the
00:05:56.770 sauerkraut
00:05:57.330 but
00:05:58.330 I
00:05:58.360 feel
00:05:58.719 like

00:05:58.900 that
00:05:59.050 would
00:05:59.259 also
00:06:00.090 help
00:06:01.090 break
00:06:01.419 down
00:06:01.449 the

00:06:01.810 cabbage
00:06:02.789 if
00:06:03.789 you
00:06:04.030 don't
00:06:04.240 want
00:06:04.509 to
00:06:04.930 use
00:06:05.289 salt
00:06:06.659 so

00:06:07.659 that
00:06:07.810 could
00:06:07.990 be
00:06:08.250 maybe
00:06:09.250 an
00:06:09.430 experiment
00:06:13.500 it's

00:06:14.500 glistening
00:06:15.190 now
00:06:16.770 and
00:06:17.770 it's
00:06:17.919 starting
00:06:18.310 to
00:06:18.400 go
00:06:18.520 a

00:06:18.550 little
00:06:18.729 translucent
00:06:19.949 so
00:06:20.949 you
00:06:21.069 can
00:06:21.190 keep

00:06:21.310 massaging
00:06:21.610 this
00:06:21.969 for
00:06:22.180 a
00:06:22.240 bit
00:06:22.830 if
00:06:23.830 you
00:06:24.009 wanted

00:06:24.340 to
00:06:24.599 but
00:06:25.599 I'm
00:06:25.719 just
00:06:26.050 going
00:06:26.379 to
00:06:26.639 get
00:06:27.639 it
00:06:27.759 in
00:06:27.849 the

00:06:27.969 mason
00:06:28.300 jar

00:06:41.310 better
00:06:42.310 lighting
00:06:49.440 if
00:06:50.440 you
00:06:50.650 have
00:06:50.860 amazing
00:06:51.190 jar

00:06:51.550 that
00:06:51.580 has
00:06:51.880 a
00:06:51.910 wider
00:06:52.450 mouth
00:07:01.710 I'm
00:07:02.710 going
00:07:03.840 or

00:07:16.420 you
00:07:17.020 also
00:07:17.200 might
00:07:17.470 want
00:07:18.210 something
00:07:20.400 like
00:07:21.400 this

00:07:21.610 to
00:07:22.000 push
00:07:22.240 the
00:07:22.680 sauerkraut
00:07:23.680 up
00:07:24.070 and
00:07:24.250 down

00:07:24.400 because
00:07:24.850 as
00:07:25.030 you
00:07:25.240 see
00:07:25.450 it's
00:07:25.660 filling
00:07:26.560 up
00:07:27.000 quite

00:07:28.000 quickly
00:07:28.390 but
00:07:28.630 there's
00:07:28.840 a
00:07:28.900 lot
00:07:29.080 of
00:07:29.110 space
00:07:29.620 in

00:07:29.860 there
00:07:49.170 so
00:07:50.170 as
00:07:50.230 you
00:07:50.410 can
00:07:50.500 see
00:07:50.560 I
00:07:51.400 managed
00:07:52.210 to

00:07:52.420 fill
00:07:52.630 up
00:07:52.780 a
00:07:53.070 jar

00:07:55.440 so
00:07:56.440 half
00:07:56.740 of
00:07:56.890 a
00:07:56.980 large
00:07:57.160 cabbage
00:07:57.760 is
00:07:58.060 more
00:07:58.930 than

00:07:59.050 enough
00:07:59.200 I
00:07:59.680 think
00:08:00.190 probably
00:08:00.900 could
00:08:01.900 have

00:08:01.990 sucked
00:08:02.230 a
00:08:02.290 little
00:08:02.380 more
00:08:02.700 into
00:08:03.700 this
00:08:03.880 one
00:08:04.180 but

00:08:04.900 it
00:08:05.230 won't
00:08:05.410 push
00:08:05.680 it
00:08:05.860 now
00:08:06.130 the
00:08:06.610 next
00:08:06.970 step
00:08:07.270 is

00:08:07.510 you're
00:08:08.110 going
00:08:09.330 to
00:08:10.620 pour
00:08:11.620 water
00:08:12.130 and
00:08:12.850 you
00:08:13.060 want

00:08:13.270 to
00:08:13.360 make
00:08:13.540 sure
00:08:13.570 that
00:08:13.900 the
00:08:14.050 water
00:08:14.230 is
00:08:14.830 above
00:08:15.340 the

00:08:15.490 cabbage
00:08:15.850 line
00:08:16.090 if
00:08:16.780 you
00:08:17.640 don't
00:08:18.640 put
00:08:18.880 enough

00:08:19.060 water
00:08:19.270 in
00:08:19.540 this
00:08:19.720 and
00:08:19.780 this
00:08:20.050 starts
00:08:20.320 to
00:08:20.410 ferment

00:08:20.680 it
00:08:21.130 will
00:08:21.400 create
00:08:21.670 mold
00:08:22.090 on
00:08:22.240 top
00:08:22.270 and
00:08:22.630 you're

00:08:22.750 gonna
00:08:22.840 have
00:08:23.020 to
00:08:23.080 throw
00:08:23.320 out
00:08:23.440 the
00:08:24.220 entire
00:08:24.250 thing

00:08:25.030 so
00:08:25.710 more
00:08:26.710 water
00:08:26.980 is
00:08:27.760 better
00:08:28.500 the
00:08:29.500 last
00:08:29.650 time
00:08:29.800 my

00:08:29.920 boyfriend
00:08:30.340 tried
00:08:30.490 to
00:08:30.550 do
00:08:30.700 this
00:08:30.940 he
00:08:31.930 didn't
00:08:32.170 put

00:08:32.290 enough
00:08:32.850 and
00:08:33.850 in
00:08:34.000 his
00:08:34.290 started
00:08:35.290 to
00:08:35.470 get
00:08:35.620 kind
00:08:35.860 of

00:08:36.010 gross
00:08:37.650 now
00:08:38.650 as
00:08:38.830 this
00:08:39.040 ferments
00:08:39.550 it
00:08:39.700 will

00:08:39.850 release
00:08:40.420 its
00:08:40.630 own
00:08:40.900 water
00:08:41.520 so
00:08:42.520 over
00:08:42.760 the
00:08:42.850 next

00:08:43.030 few
00:08:43.330 days
00:08:44.250 you're
00:08:45.250 gonna
00:08:45.340 want
00:08:45.670 to
00:08:45.790 just
00:08:46.570 keep

00:08:46.750 an
00:08:46.900 eye
00:08:46.990 on
00:08:47.020 the
00:08:47.560 water
00:08:47.770 levels
00:08:48.280 of
00:08:49.090 your

00:08:49.330 sauerkraut
00:08:49.960 and
00:08:50.580 if
00:08:51.580 you
00:08:51.790 notice
00:08:54.060 then
00:08:55.060 it

00:08:55.180 starts
00:08:55.480 to
00:08:55.540 get
00:08:55.690 too
00:08:55.900 low
00:08:56.110 you're
00:08:56.740 just
00:08:56.860 gonna

00:08:56.980 add
00:08:57.190 a
00:08:57.550 little
00:08:58.210 more
00:08:58.390 water

00:09:03.990 and
00:09:04.260 if
00:09:04.410 there's
00:09:04.590 any
00:09:04.710 sauerkraut
00:09:05.700 on
00:09:05.850 the

00:09:05.970 side
00:09:08.480 so
00:09:09.770 this
00:09:10.770 is
00:09:11.100 just
00:09:11.520 a
00:09:11.700 little
00:09:11.820 piece
00:09:12.030 of

00:09:12.150 cheesecloth
00:09:13.700 but
00:09:16.460 we
00:09:17.460 don't
00:09:17.640 have
00:09:17.760 this
00:09:17.940 you

00:09:18.090 can
00:09:18.120 probably
00:09:18.360 use
00:09:18.750 like
00:09:19.170 any
00:09:20.040 hose
00:09:20.220 or

00:09:20.610 something
00:09:20.970 else
00:09:21.120 it
00:09:21.330 just
00:09:21.360 needs
00:09:21.630 to
00:09:21.720 be
00:09:21.810 able

00:09:21.900 to
00:09:22.020 breathe

00:09:35.070 it's
00:09:35.250 tight
00:09:35.730 and
00:09:36.690 you're
00:09:37.350 gonna
00:09:37.440 want
00:09:37.710 to
00:09:37.770 keep

00:09:37.950 these
00:09:38.540 on
00:09:39.540 your
00:09:39.930 counter
00:09:40.320 for
00:09:40.650 the
00:09:41.130 next
00:09:41.340 three

00:09:41.550 days
00:09:41.670 every
00:09:42.120 day
00:09:42.270 is
00:09:42.390 kind
00:09:42.570 of
00:09:42.630 you
00:09:42.720 a
00:09:43.110 little

00:09:43.710 check
00:09:44.100 once
00:09:44.850 they
00:09:44.970 start
00:09:45.390 to
00:09:45.480 smell
00:09:45.600 a
00:09:45.720 little

00:09:45.870 bit
00:09:46.580 like
00:09:47.580 vinegar
00:09:47.850 you
00:09:48.360 can
00:09:48.780 put
00:09:48.930 them
00:09:49.050 in
00:09:49.170 the

00:09:51.650 one
00:09:52.650 thing
00:09:53.040 that
00:09:54.000 I
00:09:54.030 forgot
00:09:54.300 to
00:09:54.570 mention
00:09:54.690 it

00:09:55.140 was
00:09:55.290 that
00:09:55.620 when
00:09:55.950 you're
00:09:56.130 putting
00:09:57.740 the
00:09:58.740 lids

00:09:59.010 with
00:09:59.280 the
00:09:59.370 cheesecloth
00:09:59.790 in
00:10:00.270 here
00:10:00.600 you
00:10:00.930 need
00:10:01.110 to

00:10:01.340 also
00:10:02.340 have
00:10:02.730 something
00:10:03.030 to
00:10:03.570 push
00:10:04.020 the
00:10:04.560 cabbage

00:10:05.280 down
00:10:05.720 into
00:10:06.720 the
00:10:06.840 liquid
00:10:07.050 otherwise
00:10:07.620 it
00:10:08.070 will

00:10:08.190 rise
00:10:08.460 up
00:10:08.850 and
00:10:09.090 that
00:10:09.420 can
00:10:09.600 also
00:10:09.780 cause
00:10:10.430 mold

00:10:11.430 when
00:10:12.000 it's
00:10:12.150 starting
00:10:12.420 to
00:10:12.540 ferment
00:10:12.930 so
00:10:13.140 here
00:10:13.830 I

00:10:14.040 have
00:10:14.400 a
00:10:14.430 shot
00:10:14.880 glass
00:10:15.060 and
00:10:15.690 I'm
00:10:15.780 just
00:10:15.990 using
00:10:16.730 the

00:10:17.730 strain
00:10:18.630 from
