00:00:39.360 you
00:00:39.570 have
00:00:39.719 in
00:00:39.960 advance
00:00:40.320 one

00:00:46.110 you'll
00:00:46.260 use

00:00:46.469 plastic

00:00:54.449 here
00:00:54.629 I'm

00:03:14.459 I
00:03:14.489 said
00:03:14.879 but

00:03:15.449 you
00:03:15.720 don't
00:03:15.900 know
00:03:16.079 what

00:03:20.129 one
00:03:21.120 important
00:03:21.569 thing
00:03:21.750 about
00:03:21.900 harvesting

00:03:22.500 snails
00:03:22.769 you
00:03:23.069 can't
00:03:23.340 eat
00:03:23.549 them
00:03:23.639 right
00:03:23.849 away
00:03:24.000 you

00:03:24.480 have

00:03:27.750 nice
00:03:27.900 clean
00:03:28.260 diet
00:03:28.560 to
00:03:28.980 be
00:03:29.010 sure

00:03:29.370 that
00:03:29.579 they're
00:03:29.699 going
00:03:29.790 to
00:03:29.849 be
00:03:29.940 safe
00:03:30.180 out

00:03:30.419 somebody's
00:03:30.840 escaping
00:03:31.849 so
00:03:32.849 what
00:03:33.209 I
00:03:33.239 like
00:03:33.449 to
00:03:33.540 do

00:03:33.660 is
00:03:33.810 just
00:03:33.989 feed
00:03:34.139 them
00:03:34.260 a
00:03:34.379 little
00:03:34.620 bit
00:03:34.739 of
00:03:34.919 yellow

00:03:36.540 just
00:03:36.930 like
00:03:37.079 this
00:03:38.150 just
00:03:39.150 pour
00:03:39.360 some
00:03:39.390 in
00:03:39.689 there

00:03:40.110 they
00:03:40.439 don't
00:03:40.590 really
00:03:40.739 need
00:03:40.950 very
00:03:41.129 much
00:03:42.290 you
00:03:43.290 can

00:03:43.469 actually
00:03:43.650 just
00:03:44.159 feed
00:03:44.370 them
00:03:44.549 nothing
00:03:44.939 for
00:03:45.150 a

00:03:45.180 week
00:03:45.329 as
00:03:45.480 well
00:03:45.510 some
00:03:45.930 people
00:03:46.200 do
00:03:46.319 that
00:03:46.500 but
00:03:47.189 I

00:03:47.459 like
00:03:47.670 to
00:03:47.790 give
00:03:47.909 them
00:03:47.969 a
00:03:48.090 little
00:03:48.209 bit
00:03:48.420 of
00:03:48.510 food

00:03:48.659 so
00:03:49.170 that
00:03:49.379 they
00:03:49.530 stay
00:03:50.250 nice
00:03:50.609 and
00:03:50.879 big
00:03:51.290 so
00:03:52.290 put

00:03:52.650 some
00:03:52.859 formula
00:03:53.310 in
00:03:53.430 your
00:03:53.549 container
00:03:53.939 snails

00:03:54.629 and
00:03:55.109 then
00:03:55.950 cover
00:03:56.549 it
00:03:56.700 up
00:04:00.560 like
00:04:01.560 I
00:04:01.680 said
00:04:01.859 earlier

00:04:02.220 it's
00:04:02.459 very
00:04:02.549 important
00:04:03.269 that
00:04:03.569 the
00:04:03.689 snails
00:04:03.989 be

00:04:04.170 able
00:04:04.379 to
00:04:04.470 breathe
00:04:04.709 because
00:04:05.069 you
00:04:05.310 need
00:04:05.459 them
00:04:05.609 to

00:04:05.639 stay
00:04:05.909 alive
00:04:06.239 during
00:04:06.659 this
00:04:06.780 first
00:04:07.019 week
00:04:08.900 so

00:04:09.900 it's
00:04:10.079 been
00:04:10.290 about
00:04:10.530 two
00:04:10.889 days
00:04:11.129 since
00:04:11.549 I
00:04:11.760 put
00:04:12.060 my

00:04:12.209 snails
00:04:12.599 in
00:04:12.989 their
00:04:13.409 container
00:04:14.060 and
00:04:15.060 here
00:04:15.720 you

00:04:15.780 can
00:04:15.930 see
00:04:16.079 it
00:04:16.169 it
00:04:16.259 actually
00:04:16.410 eating
00:04:16.769 all
00:04:16.859 the

00:04:16.979 cornmeal
00:04:17.370 so
00:04:17.519 they're
00:04:17.609 pretty
00:04:17.820 hungry
00:04:18.090 and

00:04:19.049 you
00:04:19.139 can
00:04:19.259 see
00:04:19.410 there's
00:04:19.560 a
00:04:19.590 lot
00:04:19.680 of
00:04:19.769 snail
00:04:19.979 poop

00:04:24.300 brown
00:04:24.900 stuff
00:04:25.580 that's
00:04:26.580 a
00:04:26.669 good
00:04:26.849 sign
00:04:27.120 means

00:04:27.539 they're
00:04:27.870 cleaning
00:04:28.560 themselves
00:04:28.830 out
00:04:29.270 so
00:04:30.270 what

00:04:30.479 need
00:04:30.630 to
00:04:30.660 do
00:04:30.870 now
00:04:31.080 is

00:04:34.080 their
00:04:34.289 container
00:04:34.680 that's

00:04:34.919 going
00:04:35.130 to
00:04:35.220 get
00:04:35.310 rid
00:04:35.460 of
00:04:35.520 the
00:04:35.580 poop
00:04:35.789 and
00:04:36.000 it's

00:04:36.930 also
00:04:37.080 going
00:04:37.259 to
00:04:37.349 give
00:04:37.440 them
00:04:37.590 a
00:04:37.650 drink
00:04:37.919 they

00:04:38.130 need
00:04:38.520 water
00:04:38.789 like
00:04:39.030 any
00:04:39.210 living
00:04:39.419 creature
00:04:39.720 so

00:04:40.500 this
00:04:40.860 will
00:04:41.070 help
00:04:41.490 them
00:04:41.760 get
00:04:42.210 a
00:04:42.270 drink
00:04:42.539 so
00:04:42.780 what

00:04:42.960 I'm
00:04:43.050 going
00:04:43.169 to
00:04:43.199 do
00:04:43.320 is
00:04:43.440 put

00:04:53.520 see
00:04:53.580 right
00:04:53.849 now
00:04:53.880 they're
00:04:54.180 all
00:04:54.210 dormant

00:04:54.840 they're
00:04:54.960 not
00:04:55.080 moving

00:05:00.780 and
00:05:01.780 that's
00:05:01.900 perfectly
00:05:02.290 normal
00:05:02.470 at
00:05:02.770 this

00:05:02.920 stage

00:05:03.370 them
00:05:03.520 to
00:05:03.640 be
00:05:03.760 dormant
00:05:04.410 but
00:05:05.410 they

00:05:05.530 should
00:05:05.710 all
00:05:05.860 wake
00:05:06.100 up
00:05:06.130 once
00:05:06.610 I
00:05:06.760 started

00:05:07.060 spraying
00:05:07.330 them
00:05:07.540 with
00:05:07.690 water
00:05:07.900 so
00:05:08.620 one
00:05:09.400 other

00:05:09.490 benefit
00:05:09.910 of
00:05:10.060 doing
00:05:10.180 this
00:05:10.330 is
00:05:10.510 that
00:05:10.780 you'll

00:05:11.260 find
00:05:11.320 any
00:05:11.740 any
00:05:12.340 dead

00:05:13.090 you
00:05:13.570 can
00:05:14.110 take

00:05:14.590 out
00:05:14.800 cuz
00:05:15.340 you

00:08:27.130 one

00:08:27.250 of

00:08:30.700 in
00:08:30.820 there
00:08:31.000 I
00:08:31.210 figured

00:08:31.990 we

00:08:32.110 hit
00:08:32.229 go

00:08:34.270 poor
00:08:34.419 little
00:08:34.630 guys

00:08:35.860 there
00:08:36.010 they
00:08:36.130 are

00:08:36.250 boiling
00:08:36.550 away
00:08:36.789 and

00:08:37.060 give
00:08:37.150 them
00:08:37.240 five

00:08:37.539 minutes
00:08:37.659 in
00:08:38.320 the
00:08:38.500 stockpot
00:08:43.470 so

00:08:44.800 boil
00:08:45.160 my

00:08:45.370 snails
00:08:45.700 for
00:08:45.940 five
00:08:46.180 minutes
00:08:46.420 and
00:08:46.630 in
00:08:47.200 water
00:08:47.470 and

00:08:47.850 just
00:08:48.850 let
00:08:48.970 them
00:08:49.030 cool
00:08:49.240 down
00:08:49.480 enough
00:08:49.750 so
00:08:49.810 you

00:08:50.080 can
00:08:50.230 touch
00:08:50.350 them
00:08:50.560 and
00:08:50.620 work
00:08:50.770 with
00:08:50.800 a
00:08:50.980 little

00:08:51.250 bit
00:08:51.370 what
00:08:52.060 we're
00:08:52.180 going
00:08:52.300 to
00:08:52.330 do

00:08:54.730 garden
00:08:55.030 snails
00:08:55.270 are
00:08:55.450 going

00:08:55.600 to
00:08:55.660 be
00:08:55.750 pretty
00:08:56.170 small
00:08:56.500 in
00:08:56.920 comparison
00:08:57.130 to

00:08:57.970 snail
00:08:58.900 that
00:08:58.930 you're

00:09:00.940 you
00:09:01.000 may
00:09:01.150 have
00:09:01.270 seen
00:09:01.480 in
00:09:01.660 a

00:09:01.720 restaurant
00:09:02.020 snails
00:09:02.890 that
00:09:03.040 are
00:09:03.190 served
00:09:03.610 in

00:09:04.000 their
00:09:04.390 shells
00:09:05.280 one
00:09:06.280 thing
00:09:06.460 that's
00:09:06.610 important

00:09:06.970 to
00:09:07.000 realize
00:09:07.150 about
00:09:07.540 that
00:09:07.750 is
00:09:07.930 that
00:09:07.990 those

00:09:08.350 snails
00:09:08.710 have
00:09:08.950 been
00:09:09.070 taken
00:09:09.400 out
00:09:09.520 of
00:09:09.580 their

00:09:09.850 shells
00:09:10.120 first
00:09:10.510 they've
00:09:10.870 been
00:09:11.050 cooked
00:09:11.350 like

00:09:13.150 put
00:09:13.450 back
00:09:13.690 in
00:09:13.900 their
00:09:14.050 shells
00:09:14.260 for

00:09:14.500 decoration
00:09:15.270 it's
00:09:16.270 very
00:09:16.570 difficult
00:09:16.990 to
00:09:17.140 do

00:09:17.320 that
00:09:17.530 with
00:09:17.830 your
00:09:18.190 garden
00:09:18.520 snails
00:09:18.730 because

00:09:19.300 shells
00:09:19.600 are
00:09:19.750 small
00:09:20.170 so

00:09:24.370 serve
00:09:24.700 them

00:09:24.970 out
00:09:25.210 of
00:09:25.540 the
00:09:25.690 shells
00:09:25.960 which
00:09:26.740 is
00:09:26.890 another
00:09:27.070 way

00:09:27.250 you'll
00:09:27.430 see
00:09:27.610 them
00:09:27.760 sometimes
