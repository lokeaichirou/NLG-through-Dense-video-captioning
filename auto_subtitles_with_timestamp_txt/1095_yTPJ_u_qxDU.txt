00:01:58.229 like
00:01:58.290 fish
00:02:00.020 two
00:02:01.520 tablespoons
00:02:02.520 of
00:02:02.850 freshly

00:02:03.690 minced
00:02:04.320 ginger
00:02:05.300 now
00:02:06.300 if
00:02:06.690 you
00:02:06.899 don't
00:02:07.320 have

00:02:07.530 access

00:02:08.850 use
00:02:09.810 powdered

00:02:10.229 ginger
00:02:10.440 but
00:02:11.430 there's
00:02:12.120 a
00:02:12.270 special
00:02:12.870 way
00:02:13.080 that
00:02:13.470 I

00:02:13.650 learnt
00:02:14.040 of
00:02:14.340 processing
00:02:15.180 this
00:02:15.330 and
00:02:15.510 getting
00:02:15.720 it

00:02:15.810 ready
00:02:15.900 for
00:02:16.020 the
00:02:16.170 sauce
00:02:16.500 if
00:02:17.070 you
00:02:17.130 don't
00:02:17.340 do
00:02:17.489 it

00:02:17.580 this
00:02:17.670 way
00:02:17.820 you're
00:02:17.910 going
00:02:18.060 to
00:02:18.120 end
00:02:18.239 up
00:02:18.300 with

00:02:18.510 like
00:02:18.690 fibers
00:02:19.260 and
00:02:19.410 you'll
00:02:19.950 end
00:02:20.100 up
00:02:20.160 with
00:02:20.310 hairy

00:02:20.640 meat
00:02:21.060 which
00:02:21.239 is
00:02:21.420 awful
00:02:21.870 so
00:02:22.410 what
00:02:22.860 I'll
00:02:22.980 do
00:02:23.310 is

00:02:23.580 I'll
00:02:24.000 first
00:02:24.750 peel
00:02:25.019 the
00:02:25.200 root
00:02:25.440 slice
00:02:26.400 it
00:02:26.610 into

00:02:26.730 like
00:02:26.940 coin
00:02:27.330 shapes
00:02:27.720 then
00:02:28.560 you're
00:02:28.680 going
00:02:28.800 to

00:02:28.920 smash
00:02:29.430 it
00:02:29.760 with
00:02:29.970 the
00:02:30.180 side
00:02:31.019 of
00:02:31.200 your
00:02:31.350 knife
00:02:31.620 and

00:02:32.100 what
00:02:33.030 that
00:02:33.180 does
00:02:33.420 is
00:02:33.570 it
00:02:33.690 pulverize
00:02:33.989 --is
00:02:34.470 all

00:02:34.590 the
00:02:34.709 fibers
00:02:35.160 and
00:02:35.280 then
00:02:35.400 you
00:02:35.519 just
00:02:35.670 finely

00:02:36.000 mince
00:02:36.690 it
00:02:36.810 up
00:02:36.930 and
00:02:37.400 you
00:02:38.400 won't
00:02:38.580 have
00:02:38.700 that

00:02:38.760 problem
00:02:39.150 with
00:02:39.870 the
00:02:39.989 hairs
00:02:41.480 and
00:02:42.480 I'm
00:02:42.600 using
00:02:42.810 one

00:02:43.140 tablespoon
00:02:43.680 there's
00:02:44.280 a
00:02:44.370 lot
00:02:44.519 of

00:02:46.440 little
00:02:46.739 bit
00:02:46.829 of

00:02:46.920 warmth
00:02:47.250 in
00:02:47.310 the
00:02:47.430 back
00:02:47.610 of
00:02:47.760 your
00:02:47.850 throat
00:02:48.060 this

00:02:48.840 Korean
00:02:49.590 chili
00:02:50.010 paste
00:02:50.130 I
00:02:50.750 butcher
00:02:51.750 the
00:02:51.870 real

00:02:52.019 name
00:02:52.230 but
00:02:52.350 it's
00:02:52.500 a
00:02:52.680 good
00:02:53.549 Chang

00:02:54.780 put
00:02:54.959 it
00:02:55.049 up

00:02:56.220 can't
00:02:56.489 find

00:02:58.200 paste

00:02:58.500 will
00:02:58.739 work
00:02:58.860 fine
00:02:59.180 all
00:03:00.180 right
00:03:00.360 now
00:03:00.540 last
00:03:00.930 but

00:03:01.200 certainly
00:03:01.380 not
00:03:01.890 least
00:03:02.310 my
00:03:03.060 favorite

00:03:15.720 in
00:03:15.870 a
00:03:15.930 pinch
