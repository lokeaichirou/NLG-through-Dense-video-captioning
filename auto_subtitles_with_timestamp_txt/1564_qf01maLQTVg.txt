00:00:35.790 it's
00:00:36.210 so
00:00:36.390 funny

00:00:59.190 really
00:00:59.340 hit
00:00:59.489 the

00:00:59.879 so

00:02:25.030 but
00:02:25.120 if
00:02:25.450 you

00:02:25.720 look
00:02:25.870 at
00:02:25.990 the

00:03:38.170 very
00:03:38.500 simple

00:03:38.950 especially
00:03:39.280 if
00:03:39.340 you've
00:03:39.430 got
00:03:39.459 a
00:03:39.580 good
00:03:39.760 ripe

00:03:40.000 avocado

00:05:02.280 that
00:05:02.400 the
00:05:02.850 beef
00:05:03.030 is
00:05:03.240 pretty
00:05:03.510 well
00:05:03.690 cooked

00:05:03.960 through
00:05:04.440 I'm
00:05:04.770 going
00:05:05.040 to
00:05:05.100 go
00:05:05.190 ahead
00:05:05.280 and
00:05:05.520 add

00:05:05.640 our
00:05:05.820 seasonings
00:05:06.420 and
00:05:06.690 this
00:05:06.840 also
00:05:06.990 has
00:05:07.200 the

00:05:07.320 corn
00:05:07.560 starch
00:05:07.830 in
00:05:08.040 it
00:05:08.070 so
00:05:08.940 it's
00:05:09.150 about
00:05:09.360 the
00:05:09.630 same
