00:04:20.299 use
00:04:20.570 this
00:04:20.930 pancetta
00:04:21.310 and

00:04:22.310 put
00:04:23.150 it
00:04:23.300 in
00:04:23.450 the
00:04:23.630 egg
00:04:23.750 mix
00:04:24.110 and
00:04:24.500 then
00:04:25.400 keep
00:04:25.820 the

00:04:26.360 pan
00:04:26.710 for
00:04:27.710 later
00:04:27.980 because
00:04:28.820 we're
00:04:29.330 going
00:04:29.540 to
00:04:29.720 put

00:04:39.340 juice
00:04:40.340 I

00:05:04.930 a
00:05:04.960 ninja
00:05:05.770 Roman
00:05:06.960 exercises

00:05:07.960 nah
00:05:08.650 when
00:05:09.430 the
00:05:09.550 pancetta
00:05:09.880 goes
00:05:10.180 slightly

00:05:10.510 crispy
