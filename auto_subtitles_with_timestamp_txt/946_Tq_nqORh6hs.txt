00:02:32.750 white
00:02:32.990 and
00:02:33.380 we
00:02:33.980 do
00:02:34.100 that

00:02:34.310 so
00:02:34.520 that
00:02:34.550 when
00:02:34.940 we
00:02:35.090 cook
00:02:35.300 chicken
00:02:35.570 it
00:02:35.930 doesn't

00:02:36.230 dry
00:02:36.440 out

00:02:36.710 it

00:02:42.500 add
00:02:42.710 potatoes
00:02:43.190 actually
00:02:43.970 rose
00:02:44.150 because
00:02:44.450 it

00:02:44.600 helps
00:02:44.930 in
00:02:45.050 two
00:02:45.200 ways
00:02:45.440 number
00:02:46.220 one
00:02:46.460 he
00:02:46.970 starch

00:02:47.360 in
00:02:47.600 potatoes
00:02:48.160 prevents
00:02:50.560 yogurt
00:02:51.560 from

00:02:51.830 curdling
00:02:52.130 up
00:02:53.080 secondly
00:02:54.080 it
00:02:54.260 lends
00:02:54.530 a
00:02:54.680 great

00:02:55.040 flavor
00:02:55.430 to

00:02:59.090 pieces
00:02:59.120 of
00:02:59.570 chicken
00:02:59.630 because
00:03:00.110 it
00:03:00.260 cooks

00:03:00.470 faster
00:03:01.070 but
00:03:01.970 you
00:03:02.000 can
00:03:02.270 also
00:03:02.390 use
