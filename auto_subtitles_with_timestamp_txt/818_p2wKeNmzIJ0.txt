00:00:04.589 your
00:00:04.799 diet
00:00:04.980 and
00:00:05.279 not
00:00:05.970 as
00:00:06.299 hard
00:00:06.600 as
00:00:06.750 people

00:00:10.440 the
00:00:10.710 end
00:00:11.480 off

00:00:15.389 core
00:00:15.690 as
00:00:15.929 you
00:00:15.960 want
00:00:16.470 I

00:00:17.630 generally
00:00:18.630 find
00:00:18.930 that
00:00:19.289 it's
00:00:19.500 a
00:00:19.650 little
00:00:19.890 harder

00:00:20.400 and
00:00:20.600 not
00:00:21.600 so
00:00:21.900 pleasant
00:00:22.140 so
00:00:22.529 I
00:00:22.560 will
00:00:22.800 cut
00:00:23.010 out

00:00:23.039 most
00:00:23.699 of
00:00:23.970 it
00:00:24.680 this
00:00:25.680 is
00:00:25.890 generally
00:00:26.310 the

00:00:26.369 simplest
00:00:26.880 way
00:00:28.699 and
00:00:29.699 I
00:00:30.420 will
00:00:30.570 be
00:00:30.689 fermenting

00:00:31.410 this
00:00:31.650 in
00:00:31.920 a
00:00:32.550 crock
00:00:32.880 that
00:00:33.210 I
00:00:33.239 bought
00:00:33.600 at
00:00:33.840 Ace

00:00:34.079 Hardware
00:00:35.030 it
00:00:36.030 was
00:00:36.149 about
00:00:36.390 $20
00:00:37.079 for
00:00:37.110 this
00:00:37.410 crock

00:00:37.710 it's
00:00:38.460 a
00:00:38.640 one
00:00:39.000 gallon
00:00:39.239 sized
00:00:39.750 crock
00:00:42.110 and
00:00:43.110 I

00:00:43.469 bought
00:00:43.680 a
00:00:43.710 new
00:00:43.950 crop
00:00:44.219 because
00:00:44.579 they
00:00:45.090 say
00:00:45.450 that

00:00:46.110 it's
00:00:46.379 very
00:00:46.469 easy
00:00:46.739 to
00:00:47.190 leach
00:00:47.670 lead
00:00:48.239 out
00:00:48.539 of
00:00:48.750 the

00:00:48.870 old
00:00:49.050 crocks
00:00:49.440 if
00:00:49.649 they
00:00:49.739 have
00:00:49.860 any
00:00:50.160 kind
00:00:50.520 of

00:00:50.640 crack
00:00:51.090 at
00:00:51.420 all
00:00:51.770 in
00:00:52.770 their
00:00:53.039 finish
00:00:53.820 and
00:00:54.809 so
00:00:55.710 I

00:00:55.739 thought
00:00:56.100 it
00:00:56.250 was
00:00:56.370 worth
00:00:56.520 it
00:00:56.699 to
00:00:56.760 buy
00:00:57.000 a
00:00:57.030 new

00:00:57.270 crop
00:00:57.539 just
00:00:57.870 for
00:00:58.140 this
00:00:58.230 purpose

00:00:59.329 but
00:01:00.329 without
00:01:00.480 having
00:01:00.780 to
00:01:00.989 spring
00:01:01.289 like
00:01:01.500 a

00:01:01.530 hundred
00:01:01.949 dollars
00:01:02.070 for
00:01:02.579 one
00:01:02.640 of
00:01:02.789 the
00:01:02.940 fancy

00:01:03.300 fermenting
00:01:04.019 crops
00:01:04.350 this
00:01:05.309 works
00:01:05.549 just
00:01:05.880 as
00:01:06.090 well

00:01:06.119 with
00:01:06.450 the
00:01:06.570 trick
00:01:06.810 I
00:01:06.960 will
00:01:07.049 show
00:01:07.409 you
00:01:08.299 at
00:01:09.299 the

00:01:09.570 end
00:01:09.750 for
00:01:10.409 keeping
00:01:10.770 the
00:01:10.890 sauerkraut
00:01:11.400 submerged

00:01:12.119 nicely
00:01:12.900 for
00:01:13.110 fermenting

00:01:14.510 I'm
00:01:15.510 trying
00:01:15.780 to
00:01:15.840 cut
00:01:15.990 my
00:01:16.170 cabbage
00:01:17.000 pretty
00:01:18.000 thin

00:01:18.440 because
00:01:19.440 you
00:01:19.800 don't
00:01:20.010 really
00:01:20.190 want
00:01:20.630 huge

00:01:21.630 chunks
00:01:22.410 of
00:01:22.590 sauerkraut
00:01:23.030 you
00:01:24.030 want
00:01:24.210 to
00:01:24.300 be
00:01:24.390 able

00:01:24.480 to
00:01:24.600 get
00:01:24.780 just
00:01:25.050 just
00:01:25.770 as
00:01:25.920 much
00:01:26.070 sauerkraut
00:01:26.580 as

00:01:26.700 you
00:01:26.820 want
00:01:27.090 and
00:01:27.420 not
00:01:28.050 hear
00:01:28.410 strings
00:01:29.000 so
00:01:30.000 once
00:01:30.210 I

00:01:30.360 finished
00:01:30.750 slicing
00:01:31.410 it
00:01:31.530 fairly
00:01:32.100 thinly
00:01:33.770 I'll

00:01:34.770 turn
00:01:35.040 it
00:01:35.190 like
00:01:35.310 this

00:01:35.880 and
00:01:36.090 cut
00:01:36.690 across
00:01:36.780 about
00:01:37.260 three
00:01:37.680 times
00:01:38.370 so
00:01:39.000 all

00:01:39.150 those
00:01:39.330 shreds
00:01:39.750 of
00:01:39.960 cabbage
00:01:40.350 are
00:01:40.650 a
00:01:40.740 reasonable

00:01:41.190 length
00:01:41.490 and
00:01:41.850 then
00:01:42.750 just
00:01:42.990 drop
00:01:43.230 them
00:01:43.440 right
00:01:43.470 in

00:01:43.890 the
00:01:44.070 crock
00:01:44.340 here

00:01:58.760 when
00:01:59.360 you're
00:01:59.540 fermenting
00:01:59.960 the
00:02:00.200 cabbage

00:02:02.550 you
00:02:03.150 really
00:02:03.570 want
00:02:04.380 it
00:02:04.590 to
00:02:04.770 be
00:02:04.890 completely

00:02:05.490 submerged
00:02:06.090 in
00:02:06.300 water
00:02:06.800 because
00:02:09.140 the
00:02:10.140 good

00:02:11.010 bacteria
00:02:11.310 are
00:02:12.240 anaerobic
00:02:12.870 they
00:02:13.740 grow
00:02:14.040 without

00:02:14.580 the
00:02:14.790 presence
00:02:15.150 of
00:02:15.270 oxygen
00:02:15.480 and
00:02:15.870 the
00:02:16.500 bad

00:02:16.680 bacteria
00:02:17.010 that
00:02:17.520 might
00:02:17.760 take
00:02:18.000 over
00:02:18.300 if
00:02:18.390 you're

00:02:18.540 not
00:02:18.720 careful
00:02:18.930 require
00:02:19.620 the
00:02:19.860 presence
00:02:20.190 of

00:02:20.340 oxygen
00:02:20.660 so
00:02:21.660 loves
00:02:22.440 everything's
00:02:22.980 in
00:02:23.220 there

00:02:23.400 you
00:02:23.700 want
00:02:23.910 it
00:02:23.970 to
00:02:24.090 make
00:02:24.240 sure
00:02:24.540 you
00:02:25.020 want
00:02:25.170 to

00:02:25.230 make
00:02:25.320 sure
00:02:25.350 it
00:02:25.560 is
00:02:25.650 completely
00:02:26.190 submerged
00:02:27.000 in

00:02:27.120 liquid
00:02:27.260 the
00:02:28.260 fermenting
00:02:28.950 process
00:02:30.650 and
00:02:31.650 the

00:02:32.190 fermenting
00:02:32.730 process
00:02:32.870 pretty
00:02:33.870 much
00:02:34.020 takes
00:02:34.350 as

00:02:34.530 long
00:02:34.740 as
00:02:34.920 you
00:02:35.040 want
00:02:35.220 it
00:02:35.280 to
00:02:35.460 you
00:02:35.730 want
00:02:35.820 to
00:02:35.940 leave

00:02:36.090 it
00:02:36.240 for
00:02:36.270 at
00:02:36.510 least
00:02:36.660 a
00:02:36.870 week
00:02:37.280 usually
00:02:38.280 I
00:02:38.310 leave

00:02:38.670 it
00:02:38.850 for
00:02:39.060 somewhere
00:02:39.390 between
00:02:39.620 two
00:02:40.620 or
00:02:40.830 three

00:02:40.860 weeks
00:02:41.520 whenever
00:02:41.850 I
00:02:42.090 think
00:02:42.240 oh
00:02:42.600 hey
00:02:42.930 I
00:02:43.260 had

00:02:43.860 summer
00:02:44.190 cup
00:02:44.490 fermenting
00:02:45.030 around
00:02:45.240 here

00:02:45.420 somewhere
00:02:45.840 I
00:02:46.020 wonder
00:02:46.710 if
00:02:46.800 it's
00:02:46.950 ready
00:02:47.130 yet

00:02:54.550 there's
00:02:55.120 the
00:02:55.330 cabbage
00:02:55.780 this
00:02:56.050 is
00:02:56.230 big
00:02:56.440 enough

00:02:56.680 that
00:02:56.740 I
00:02:57.070 can
00:02:57.340 do
00:02:57.790 two
00:02:58.060 heads
00:02:58.330 of
00:02:58.420 cabbage
00:02:58.660 if
00:02:58.930 I

00:02:59.020 want
00:02:59.290 but
00:02:59.380 then
00:02:59.620 it's
00:02:59.770 very
00:03:00.130 full
00:03:00.490 at
00:03:01.150 the

00:03:01.420 beginning
00:03:01.780 before
00:03:02.050 it
00:03:02.440 it
00:03:02.680 is
00:03:03.400 compressed

00:03:04.030 down
00:03:08.220 so
00:03:09.220 it's
00:03:09.430 simpler
00:03:09.850 to
00:03:10.060 deal
00:03:10.270 with
00:03:10.510 if
00:03:10.750 I

00:03:10.990 just
00:03:11.200 do
00:03:11.380 one
00:03:11.560 head
00:03:11.770 of
00:03:11.920 the
00:03:12.010 time
00:03:12.510 for
00:03:13.510 one

00:03:13.660 head
00:03:13.870 of
00:03:13.990 cabbage
00:03:14.410 I'm
00:03:14.560 going
00:03:14.830 to
00:03:14.890 put
00:03:15.040 on
00:03:15.130 a

00:03:15.160 tablespoon
00:03:15.820 of
00:03:15.850 salt
00:03:16.120 this
00:03:16.870 is
00:03:16.930 my
00:03:17.230 usual
00:03:17.470 pink

00:03:17.980 Himalayan
00:03:18.550 sea
00:03:18.760 salt
00:03:18.790 full
00:03:19.330 of
00:03:19.450 lots
00:03:19.630 of
00:03:19.810 good

00:03:19.990 minerals
00:03:20.350 and
00:03:21.340 I
00:03:21.430 just
00:03:21.640 sprinkle
00:03:22.030 that
00:03:22.060 over

00:03:22.210 the
00:03:22.510 cabbage

00:03:27.770 and
00:03:27.980 you
00:03:28.880 can
00:03:29.410 let
00:03:30.410 it
00:03:30.440 sit
00:03:30.560 for
00:03:30.800 a
00:03:31.070 few
00:03:31.100 minutes

00:03:31.280 I
00:03:31.790 will
00:03:32.480 go
00:03:32.630 ahead
00:03:32.750 and
00:03:33.110 start
00:03:33.440 working
00:03:33.800 the

00:03:34.160 salt
00:03:34.460 into
00:03:34.880 it
00:03:34.910 now
00:03:36.010 this
00:03:37.010 works
00:03:37.250 better
00:03:37.550 on
00:03:37.880 a

00:03:38.810 lower
00:03:39.200 surface
00:03:39.560 because
00:03:40.190 I'm
00:03:40.400 short
00:03:40.760 and
00:03:41.390 it

00:03:41.540 helps
00:03:41.810 to
00:03:41.930 get
00:03:42.020 your
00:03:42.170 body
00:03:42.230 weight
00:03:42.650 down
00:03:42.830 into

00:03:43.190 it
00:03:43.310 but
00:03:44.090 you
00:03:44.240 just
00:03:44.420 start
00:03:45.490 tossing
00:03:46.490 it
00:03:46.910 to
00:03:47.030 get

00:03:47.150 the
00:03:47.270 salt
00:03:47.480 evenly
00:03:47.930 distributed
00:03:48.560 and
00:03:49.000 then

00:03:50.000 start
00:03:50.390 squeezing
00:03:50.870 and
00:03:51.380 pressing
00:03:51.950 on
00:03:52.130 the

00:03:52.280 cabbage
00:03:52.730 and
00:03:53.210 in
00:03:54.020 just
00:03:54.350 a
00:03:54.500 few
00:03:54.770 minutes
00:03:55.240 the

00:03:56.240 cabbage
00:03:56.750 will
00:03:56.960 start
00:03:57.260 releasing
00:03:57.440 liquid

00:04:01.840 and
00:04:02.840 you
00:04:03.170 will

00:04:04.990 your
00:04:05.620 cabbage
00:04:06.040 will
00:04:06.190 take
00:04:06.340 up
00:04:06.490 a
00:04:06.580 lot
00:04:06.730 less

00:04:06.970 space
00:04:07.030 and
00:04:07.600 the
00:04:07.750 liquid
00:04:08.140 usually
00:04:08.800 for
00:04:09.010 me
00:04:09.160 will

00:04:09.400 almost
00:04:10.090 cover
00:04:10.450 the
00:04:10.600 cabbage
00:04:11.050 I
00:04:11.320 always
00:04:12.040 have

00:04:12.220 to
00:04:12.370 add
00:04:12.520 a
00:04:12.550 little
00:04:12.970 bit
00:04:13.090 of
00:04:13.330 filtered
00:04:13.720 water
00:04:14.160 so

00:04:15.160 that
00:04:15.190 it's
00:04:15.490 completely
00:04:16.120 submerged

00:04:18.560 and
00:04:19.190 this
00:04:19.340 process
00:04:19.579 will
00:04:20.090 take
00:04:20.150 a
00:04:20.389 few
00:04:20.690 minutes

00:04:21.019 and
00:04:21.709 as
00:04:23.020 slightly
00:04:24.020 energetic
00:04:25.720 requires
00:04:26.720 a

00:04:26.810 little
00:04:27.020 bit
00:04:27.110 of
00:04:27.260 muscle

00:04:35.559 after
00:04:36.309 a
00:04:36.339 couple
00:04:36.609 minutes
00:04:36.819 of
00:04:37.179 working
00:04:37.659 and

00:04:37.839 squeezing
00:04:38.409 this
00:04:38.619 it's
00:04:39.009 compressed
00:04:39.639 down

00:04:40.289 packed
00:04:41.289 pretty
00:04:41.619 tightly
00:04:41.919 there
00:04:42.219 in
00:04:42.309 the

00:04:42.399 bottom
00:04:42.549 of
00:04:42.759 the
00:04:42.849 pot
00:04:43.079 it's
00:04:44.079 a
00:04:44.199 lot
00:04:44.409 moister

00:04:44.739 than
00:04:45.099 it
00:04:45.309 was
00:04:45.459 when
00:04:45.639 I
00:04:45.759 started
00:04:46.559 normally
00:04:47.559 I

00:04:47.619 can
00:04:47.739 tell
00:04:48.069 it's
00:04:48.249 done
00:04:48.519 when
00:04:48.939 the
00:04:49.329 liquid
00:04:49.749 is

00:04:49.959 just
00:04:50.409 coming
00:04:50.859 up
00:04:51.269 almost
00:04:52.269 to
00:04:52.509 the
00:04:52.629 service
00:04:53.079 of

00:04:53.349 the
00:04:53.649 cabbage
00:04:54.069 when
00:04:54.309 I
00:04:54.339 press
00:04:54.669 on
00:04:54.879 it
00:04:54.999 like
00:04:55.149 this

00:04:55.329 and
00:04:55.539 I
00:04:55.599 press
00:04:55.809 it
00:04:55.959 down
00:04:56.109 very
00:04:56.889 firmly
00:04:57.599 you'll

00:04:58.599 want
00:04:58.779 it
00:04:58.809 packed
00:04:59.079 in
00:04:59.289 there
00:04:59.469 very
00:04:59.739 tightly
00:05:00.239 for

00:05:01.239 the
00:05:01.329 next
00:05:01.599 step
00:05:02.489 this
00:05:03.489 cabbage
00:05:03.969 is
00:05:04.059 not

00:05:04.239 releasing
00:05:04.659 quite
00:05:04.869 as
00:05:04.989 much
00:05:05.169 water
00:05:05.439 but
00:05:06.249 that

00:05:06.279 is
00:05:06.549 perfectly
00:05:07.029 fine
00:05:07.299 I'll
00:05:07.629 just
00:05:07.689 add
00:05:08.019 a
00:05:08.049 little

00:05:08.199 more
00:05:08.439 filtered
00:05:08.859 water
00:05:09.009 so
00:05:09.339 that
00:05:09.369 submerged

00:05:12.179 and
00:05:13.179 once
00:05:13.839 it
00:05:14.019 is
00:05:14.049 packed
00:05:14.439 in
00:05:14.769 there
00:05:15.039 tightly

00:05:19.050 I
00:05:19.110 will
00:05:19.800 add
00:05:19.979 my
00:05:20.220 water
00:05:20.460 and
00:05:20.789 then
00:05:21.120 I
00:05:21.180 will
00:05:21.389 show

00:05:21.599 you
00:05:21.659 my
00:05:21.870 trick
00:05:22.110 for
00:05:22.349 keeping
00:05:22.770 it
00:05:22.860 submerged
00:05:23.280 I

00:05:23.490 learned
00:05:23.970 from
00:05:24.180 My
00:05:24.360 Father

00:05:34.380 I
00:05:34.440 have
00:05:35.310 water
00:05:35.580 probably
00:05:36.270 till
00:05:36.510 it's
00:05:36.660 just

00:05:36.900 about
00:05:37.170 an
00:05:37.500 inch
00:05:37.800 or
00:05:38.010 two
00:05:38.220 above
00:05:38.490 the
00:05:38.880 surface

00:05:39.090 of
00:05:39.360 the
00:05:39.420 cabbage
00:05:39.870 you
00:05:40.140 have
00:05:40.650 a
00:05:40.680 little
00:05:40.920 bit

00:05:41.100 floating
00:05:41.460 at
00:05:41.700 this
00:05:41.850 point
00:05:43.310 kind
00:05:44.310 of
00:05:44.400 hard
00:05:44.550 to

00:05:44.580 show
00:05:44.820 you
00:05:44.850 with
00:05:45.090 the
00:05:45.180 angle
00:05:45.480 of
00:05:45.510 the
00:05:45.630 camera

00:05:45.990 there
00:05:46.140 but
00:05:47.070 that
00:05:47.450 there's
00:05:48.450 what
00:05:48.690 it
00:05:48.780 looks

00:05:48.960 like
00:05:49.140 when
00:05:49.620 it's
00:05:49.770 tilted

00:05:56.580 and
00:05:56.729 I
00:05:57.599 will
00:05:57.930 go
00:05:58.110 get
00:05:58.349 a
00:05:58.560 gallon
00:05:58.979 size
00:05:59.370 ziploc

00:06:00.030 bag
00:06:00.360 and
00:06:01.849 then
00:06:02.849 I'm
00:06:02.970 going
00:06:03.150 to
00:06:03.240 fill
00:06:03.479 this
00:06:03.509 part

00:06:03.960 way
00:06:04.199 with
00:06:04.440 water
00:06:04.770 this
00:06:05.039 is
00:06:05.099 not
00:06:05.400 going
00:06:05.610 to
00:06:05.669 come

00:06:05.849 in
00:06:05.970 contact
00:06:06.180 with
00:06:06.479 the
00:06:06.599 sauerkraut
00:06:06.900 so
00:06:07.199 I'm

00:06:07.289 just
00:06:07.440 using
00:06:07.740 normal
00:06:07.860 tap
00:06:08.190 water
00:06:08.460 here

00:06:14.870 and
00:06:15.260 I
00:06:15.290 put
00:06:16.070 probably
00:06:17.889 two
00:06:18.889 ports
00:06:19.340 or
00:06:19.550 so
00:06:19.730 of

00:06:19.940 water
00:06:20.210 in
00:06:20.419 the
00:06:20.510 bag
00:06:20.690 usually
00:06:21.080 maybe
00:06:21.860 a
00:06:21.949 little

00:06:22.160 less
00:06:24.400 it
00:06:25.400 just
00:06:25.669 needs
00:06:25.880 to
00:06:26.000 be
00:06:26.300 enough
00:06:26.600 to
00:06:26.810 make

00:06:26.960 a
00:06:26.990 good
00:06:27.260 seal
00:06:27.800 on
00:06:28.100 the
00:06:28.250 sauerkraut
00:06:28.580 and
00:06:29.120 then

00:06:29.740 in
00:06:30.740 order
00:06:31.400 to
00:06:31.550 seal
00:06:32.210 it
00:06:32.389 tightly
00:06:32.690 I
00:06:33.490 close
00:06:35.800 the

00:06:36.800 zip
00:06:37.070 on
00:06:37.310 most
00:06:37.790 of
00:06:38.000 the
00:06:38.120 bag
00:06:38.330 and
00:06:39.310 then
00:06:40.310 tilt
00:06:40.699 it

00:06:41.139 so
00:06:42.139 that
00:06:42.290 the
00:06:42.410 water
00:06:42.590 is
00:06:42.800 there
00:06:43.930 and
00:06:45.699 then

00:06:46.699 there's
00:06:46.910 just
00:06:47.120 this
00:06:47.240 small
00:06:47.450 portion
00:06:47.870 here

00:06:48.440 where
00:06:49.100 I'm
00:06:49.220 letting
00:06:49.490 the
00:06:49.610 air
00:06:49.820 out
00:06:49.850 to
00:06:50.389 get
00:06:50.510 as

00:06:50.630 tight
00:06:50.870 as
00:06:51.020 seal
00:06:51.200 as
00:06:51.350 possible
00:06:51.919 mostly
00:06:52.490 that

00:06:52.669 just
00:06:52.850 makes
00:06:53.000 it
00:06:53.090 easier
00:06:53.240 to
00:06:53.479 work
00:06:53.660 with
00:06:53.720 it

00:06:54.139 doesn't
00:06:54.260 have
00:06:54.530 to
00:06:54.680 have
00:06:54.830 no
00:06:55.790 air
00:06:56.120 left
00:06:56.330 in
00:06:56.600 it

00:06:56.750 it's
00:06:57.350 just
00:06:57.590 easier
00:06:57.860 if
00:06:57.950 it's
00:06:58.100 mostly
00:06:58.280 water

00:06:58.700 and
00:06:59.030 then
00:06:59.870 I
00:06:59.960 just
00:07:00.139 drop
00:07:00.470 this
00:07:00.740 down
00:07:01.100 on
00:07:01.690 top
00:07:02.690 of

00:07:02.870 the
00:07:02.990 cabbage
00:07:03.440 and
00:07:04.130 you'll
00:07:05.000 see
00:07:05.210 a
00:07:05.240 little
00:07:05.570 bit

00:07:05.720 of
00:07:05.780 water
00:07:06.110 come
00:07:06.410 up
00:07:06.440 around
00:07:07.039 the
00:07:07.310 edges
00:07:07.610 of
00:07:07.729 the

00:07:07.789 bag
00:07:08.060 but
00:07:08.690 the
00:07:08.900 cabbage
00:07:09.320 will
00:07:09.500 stay
00:07:09.710 neatly

00:07:10.010 submerged
00:07:10.580 under
00:07:11.060 the
00:07:11.180 bag
00:07:11.360 and
00:07:11.600 of
00:07:11.660 course

00:07:11.690 the
00:07:12.050 bag
00:07:12.200 form
00:07:12.620 fits
00:07:12.949 to
00:07:13.220 the
00:07:13.310 edges
00:07:13.610 of
00:07:13.729 the

00:07:13.820 container
00:07:14.030 so
00:07:14.990 it
00:07:15.080 makes
00:07:15.229 a
00:07:15.350 really
00:07:15.500 good
00:07:15.770 seal

00:07:16.130 on
00:07:16.340 there
00:07:16.580 keeping
00:07:17.389 all
00:07:17.539 of
00:07:17.570 the
00:07:17.780 air
00:07:17.960 out
00:07:18.169 so

00:07:18.680 the
00:07:18.770 bad
00:07:18.950 bacteria
00:07:19.220 you
00:07:19.639 can't
00:07:19.880 work
00:07:20.350 I'll

00:07:21.350 usually
00:07:21.590 throw

00:07:30.200 then
00:07:30.410 like
00:07:30.590 I
00:07:30.710 said
00:07:30.740 just
00:07:30.950 let

00:07:32.180 weeks
00:07:32.389 or
00:07:32.930 you
00:07:33.320 can

00:07:41.270 is
00:07:41.330 a
00:07:41.479 technique

00:07:44.960 sauerkraut
00:07:45.320 without
00:07:45.830 refrigeration
