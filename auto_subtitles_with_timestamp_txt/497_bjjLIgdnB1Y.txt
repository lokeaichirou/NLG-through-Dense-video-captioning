00:03:40.700 a
00:03:40.730 flat
00:03:41.209 bottom

00:04:02.329 enough
00:04:02.780 you

00:04:12.879 so
00:04:13.879 just
00:04:14.299 keep
00:04:14.510 it
00:04:14.690 down

00:04:16.220 you

00:04:34.639 measuring
00:04:35.539 cup

00:04:35.660 and
00:04:36.050 then
00:04:36.139 just

00:04:38.330 you
00:04:38.389 want
00:04:38.750 and
00:04:38.990 of
00:04:39.680 course
00:04:39.919 you
00:04:40.070 can
00:04:40.220 make
00:04:40.340 your

00:04:40.460 pancakes
00:04:40.639 as
00:04:41.120 big
00:04:41.360 or
00:04:41.539 as
00:04:41.810 small
00:04:41.840 as
00:04:42.289 you
00:04:42.440 want

00:04:43.780 just
00:04:44.780 make
00:04:45.169 sure
00:04:45.410 that
00:04:45.710 you
00:04:45.860 space
00:04:46.250 them
00:04:46.280 a

00:04:46.639 little
00:04:46.940 bit
00:04:47.090 apart
00:04:47.449 because
00:04:47.960 as
00:04:48.620 you
00:04:48.800 know
00:04:48.949 the

00:04:49.160 batter
00:04:49.400 will
00:04:49.639 spread

00:05:05.669 course
00:05:05.880 I
00:05:06.000 could
00:05:06.120 probably
00:05:06.330 do

00:05:06.570 more
00:05:06.780 on
00:05:07.020 this
00:05:07.340 pan
00:05:08.340 but
00:05:09.710 and
00:05:10.710 then

00:05:31.680 is
00:05:31.919 pretty

00:05:32.220 well

00:05:48.780 two
00:05:49.110 three

00:05:49.380 minutes

00:06:57.960 them
00:06:58.259 all
00:06:58.380 up
00:06:58.440 one
00:06:58.800 on
00:06:58.949 top
00:06:59.099 of

00:06:59.159 the
00:06:59.370 other
00:06:59.580 but
00:07:00.180 don't
00:07:00.389 do
00:07:00.509 that
00:07:00.539 because
00:07:01.020 what

00:07:01.199 happens
00:07:01.620 is
00:07:01.830 the
00:07:02.099 bottom
00:07:02.280 ones
00:07:02.580 get
00:07:02.820 all
00:07:03.000 soggy

00:07:03.300 so
00:07:03.900 try
00:07:04.139 to
00:07:04.169 have
00:07:04.500 a
00:07:04.530 plate
00:07:04.949 or
00:07:04.979 a
00:07:05.190 platter
00:07:05.520 like

00:07:05.880 this
00:07:06.210 and
00:07:06.570 just
00:07:09.590 do
00:07:10.590 it
00:07:10.740 this
00:07:11.219 way
00:07:11.490 now
00:07:12.000 if
00:07:12.270 you

00:07:12.419 weren't
00:07:12.719 serving
00:07:12.990 these

00:07:13.800 right
00:07:13.949 away
00:07:14.099 so
00:07:14.280 your
00:07:14.639 family's
00:07:15.120 still
00:07:15.479 in
00:07:15.870 bed

00:07:16.139 you
00:07:16.680 could
00:07:16.949 just
00:07:17.220 turn
00:07:17.520 your
00:07:17.699 oven
00:07:17.879 to
00:07:18.110 175

00:07:19.110 degrees
00:07:19.520 Fahrenheit
00:07:20.520 that's
00:07:20.699 about
00:07:21.000 80

00:07:21.210 degrees
00:07:21.419 Celsius
00:07:22.199 and
00:07:22.319 just
00:07:22.860 put
00:07:23.069 these

00:07:23.220 pancakes
00:07:23.610 directly
00:07:24.479 on
00:07:24.629 the
00:07:24.780 wire
00:07:24.960 rack
00:07:25.319 and

00:07:25.349 they
00:07:25.620 you
00:07:25.740 can
00:07:25.889 keep
00:07:26.039 them
00:07:26.220 there
00:07:26.430 for

00:07:26.789 15-20
00:07:27.389 minutes
00:07:28.020 so

00:07:31.319 pancakes
00:07:31.949 what
00:07:32.310 I
00:07:32.340 would
00:07:32.639 do
