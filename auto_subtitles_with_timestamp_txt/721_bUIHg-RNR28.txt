00:03:00.040 using
00:03:00.220 a
00:03:00.489 very
00:03:00.730 simple

00:03:01.470 seasoned
00:03:02.470 flour
00:03:02.709 mixture
00:03:03.959 for
00:03:04.959 the
00:03:04.989 calamari

00:03:05.709 now
00:03:06.340 it's
00:03:06.579 all-purpose
00:03:07.269 flour
00:03:07.420 a
00:03:07.720 little
00:03:07.900 bit

00:03:08.290 of
00:03:08.379 pepper
00:03:08.620 coarse
00:03:09.549 salt
00:03:09.849 paprika
00:03:10.629 and

00:03:11.260 cayenne
00:03:11.680 but
00:03:12.099 you
00:03:12.220 could
00:03:12.400 use
00:03:12.639 anything
00:03:12.970 in

00:03:13.239 this
00:03:13.420 mix
00:03:13.690 you
00:03:13.870 could
00:03:14.079 use
00:03:14.260 a
00:03:14.290 little
00:03:14.590 bit
00:03:14.829 of

00:03:14.950 old

00:03:19.349 again
00:03:20.349 I'm
00:03:20.650 using

00:03:20.829 all-purpose
00:03:21.549 flour
00:03:21.639 but
00:03:22.030 you
00:03:22.120 could
00:03:22.329 use
00:03:22.450 rice

00:03:22.750 flour
00:03:22.780 that
00:03:23.319 would

00:03:23.829 a
00:03:23.859 lighter

00:03:24.340 coating

00:03:45.329 any
00:03:46.329 residual

00:03:47.319 moisture

00:03:55.269 bigger

00:03:55.450 than

00:04:04.900 your
00:04:05.620 pot
00:04:05.889 because

00:04:06.519 what
00:04:06.700 it
00:04:06.790 does
00:04:06.910 is
00:04:07.030 it
00:04:07.150 brings

00:04:10.629 soak

00:04:16.690 over

00:04:17.450 crowd
00:04:17.830 make

00:04:19.580 watching
00:04:19.790 the

00:04:20.930 staying
00:04:21.500 at
00:04:21.860 around
