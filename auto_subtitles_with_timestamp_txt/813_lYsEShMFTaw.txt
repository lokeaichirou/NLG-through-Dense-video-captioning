00:02:32.400 little
00:02:32.549 bit

00:02:32.760 salty

00:02:36.660 bit
00:02:36.840 too
00:02:37.170 salty

00:02:37.799 but
00:02:38.060 it'll
00:02:39.060 have
00:02:39.209 to
00:02:39.330 do
00:02:39.540 so
00:02:40.190 you
00:02:41.190 know
00:02:41.280 it's

00:02:41.430 not
00:02:41.549 much
00:02:41.910 you

00:02:44.970 thought
00:02:45.150 you
00:02:45.239 are
00:02:45.390 the
00:02:45.690 easier

00:02:46.260 is
00:02:46.410 to
00:02:47.090 into
00:02:48.090 the
00:02:48.180 job
00:02:50.120 so
00:02:51.120 it's
00:02:51.900 not
00:02:52.080 such
00:02:52.349 a

00:02:52.380 bad
00:02:52.620 thing
00:02:52.680 I've
00:02:53.069 actually
00:02:53.400 found
00:02:53.730 what
00:02:53.910 I

00:02:58.519 enjoy
00:02:59.519 it
00:02:59.670 as
00:02:59.790 much
00:02:59.820 so
00:03:00.299 it's
00:03:00.959 a
00:03:01.049 personal

00:03:01.500 preference
00:03:01.739 thing
00:03:02.600 around
00:03:09.769 really
00:03:11.090 puts
00:03:12.090 it

00:03:12.390 down
00:03:12.739 really
00:03:13.739 hard
00:03:14.220 and
00:03:17.420 moisture
00:03:18.420 out
00:03:18.680 the

00:03:19.680 crap
00:03:20.010 and
00:03:22.760 because
00:03:23.760 we
00:03:23.880 want
00:03:24.299 the

00:03:24.480 fermentation

00:03:25.139 happen
00:03:25.380 under
00:03:25.709 liquid
00:03:26.100 and

00:03:26.310 you're
00:03:26.579 not
00:03:26.730 gonna
00:03:26.880 believe
00:03:27.180 this
00:03:27.389 when
00:03:27.600 you

00:03:27.660 start
00:03:27.930 packing
00:03:28.260 into

00:03:28.470 job
00:03:28.680 oh
00:03:29.280 I
00:03:29.370 think
00:03:29.579 you

00:03:30.000 know
00:03:30.090 it's
00:03:30.239 never
00:03:30.359 gonna
00:03:30.600 get
00:03:30.840 enough
00:03:31.260 liquid

00:03:31.950 art
00:03:32.280 and
00:03:32.519 in
00:03:33.120 the
00:03:33.840 end
00:03:33.989 it
00:03:34.170 always

00:03:38.310 easier
00:03:38.370 with
00:03:38.609 my

00:03:38.760 hand
00:03:39.000 just

00:03:50.990 you
00:03:51.709 know
00:03:51.770 I
00:03:51.830 think

00:03:54.709 I
00:03:54.770 do
00:03:54.890 it
00:03:55.160 so
00:03:56.060 I've
00:03:56.120 just
00:03:56.150 spent
00:03:56.420 a
00:03:56.540 few

00:03:56.750 minutes
00:03:56.900 really
00:03:57.440 packing
00:03:57.740 it
00:03:58.010 down
00:03:58.220 with
00:03:58.430 my

00:03:58.550 hand
00:03:59.030 with
00:03:59.120 a
00:03:59.240 spoon
00:03:59.830 hopefully
00:04:00.830 you've
00:04:00.980 gotta

00:04:01.160 see
00:04:01.459 that
00:04:02.209 there's
00:04:02.450 a
00:04:02.690 fair
00:04:03.380 bit
00:04:03.410 of
00:04:03.740 liquid
00:04:04.130 in

00:04:04.610 there
00:04:04.910 it's
00:04:05.090 not
00:04:05.410 it's
00:04:06.410 you
00:04:06.800 know
00:04:06.890 more
00:04:07.220 and

00:04:07.370 more
00:04:07.430 is
00:04:07.670 coming
00:04:07.700 out
00:04:08.180 each
00:04:08.450 time
00:04:08.750 and
00:04:09.080 like
00:04:09.440 it

00:04:10.100 takes
00:04:10.370 a
00:04:10.520 little
00:04:10.640 while
00:04:10.880 and
00:04:11.570 well
00:04:12.170 sometimes

00:04:12.530 what
00:04:12.590 I
00:04:12.680 do
00:04:12.770 is
00:04:12.890 that
00:04:13.069 I
00:04:13.250 pack
00:04:13.760 it
00:04:13.790 in
00:04:14.300 and
00:04:14.510 I'm

00:04:14.840 not
00:04:14.900 getting
00:04:15.110 the
00:04:15.350 liquid
00:04:15.530 I
00:04:15.860 just
00:04:16.040 let
00:04:16.190 it
00:04:16.220 sit

00:04:16.579 for
00:04:16.609 five
00:04:17.120 minutes
00:04:17.359 walk
00:04:17.660 away
00:04:17.690 from
00:04:18.140 it
00:04:18.290 and

00:04:18.440 then
00:04:18.590 come
00:04:18.829 back
00:04:18.859 to
00:04:19.040 it
00:04:19.280 and
00:04:19.430 like
00:04:19.730 this
00:04:19.880 salt

00:04:20.150 draw
00:04:21.140 the
00:04:21.200 liquid
00:04:21.440 I
00:04:21.709 hope
00:04:21.980 this
00:04:22.100 furball
00:04:22.520 in

00:04:22.610 the
00:04:22.760 background
00:04:24.040 is
00:04:25.040 this
00:04:25.190 story
00:04:25.460 so
00:04:26.330 what
00:04:27.020 we

00:04:27.230 liquid
00:04:27.950 is
00:04:28.010 really
00:04:28.190 important
00:04:28.730 because
00:04:28.850 the

00:04:29.210 fermentation
00:04:29.570 has
00:04:30.200 to
00:04:30.410 be
00:04:30.590 has
00:04:31.580 to
00:04:31.610 happen

00:04:31.970 under
00:04:32.210 under
00:04:32.780 the
00:04:32.810 liquid
00:04:33.230 in
00:04:33.350 anaerobic

00:04:33.770 environments
00:04:34.669 if
00:04:34.790 it's
00:04:34.940 air
00:04:35.240 there
00:04:35.540 they

00:04:36.290 lactic
00:04:36.650 acid
00:04:36.950 bacteria
00:04:37.400 can't
00:04:37.669 do
00:04:37.880 their

00:04:38.060 thing
00:04:38.360 so
00:04:38.750 just
00:04:39.200 keep
00:04:40.540 pushing
00:04:41.540 down
00:04:41.690 with
00:04:41.810 the

00:04:41.900 screen
00:04:42.200 and
00:04:42.440 if
00:04:42.590 you
00:04:42.650 get
00:04:42.890 really
00:04:43.190 you
00:04:43.490 know

00:04:43.520 frustrated
00:04:44.419 and
00:04:44.480 you
00:04:44.570 finally
00:04:44.840 not
00:04:45.110 getting

00:04:45.440 the
00:04:45.680 liquid
00:04:45.860 out
00:04:46.280 you
00:04:46.790 can
00:04:47.060 always
00:04:47.180 just
00:04:47.480 top

00:04:47.690 it
00:04:47.720 up
00:04:47.900 with
00:04:47.930 a
00:04:48.080 little
00:04:48.290 bit
00:04:48.470 of
00:04:48.590 water
00:04:48.830 but
00:04:49.280 the

00:04:49.370 problem
00:04:49.669 with
00:04:49.790 water
00:04:50.030 is
00:04:50.620 it's
00:04:51.620 going
00:04:51.919 to

00:04:52.040 dilute
00:04:52.520 the
00:04:52.790 flavor
00:04:52.820 of
00:04:53.150 the
00:04:53.330 sauerkraut

00:04:53.950 sometimes
00:04:54.950 you'll
00:04:55.070 get
00:04:55.130 to
00:04:55.280 a
00:04:55.310 point
00:04:55.520 where

00:04:55.729 you
00:04:55.820 just
00:04:55.850 go
00:04:56.090 oh
00:04:56.120 I
00:04:56.360 couldn't
00:04:56.750 be
00:04:56.810 bothered
00:04:56.990 so

00:04:57.470 that's
00:04:58.460 looking
00:04:58.610 pretty
00:04:58.790 good
00:04:59.150 to
00:04:59.270 me
00:04:59.419 so
00:05:00.040 okay

00:05:01.040 so
00:05:01.430 you
00:05:02.300 know
00:05:02.360 that
00:05:02.690 you
00:05:02.870 not
00:05:02.990 completely

00:05:03.710 submerge
00:05:04.340 there's
00:05:04.700 a
00:05:04.790 lot
00:05:05.270 of
00:05:05.390 fair
00:05:05.600 bit
00:05:05.810 of

00:05:05.900 that
00:05:06.020 going
00:05:06.260 around
00:05:07.060 so
00:05:08.060 what
00:05:08.360 we're
00:05:08.479 gonna
00:05:08.540 do

00:05:08.780 now
00:05:08.930 is
00:05:09.200 just
00:05:09.380 put
00:05:09.770 the
00:05:10.220 lid
00:05:10.490 on
00:05:10.580 and
00:05:10.910 let
00:05:11.000 it

00:05:11.210 sit
00:05:11.620 at
00:05:12.620 for
00:05:13.040 a
00:05:13.070 few
00:05:13.460 days
00:05:13.610 so
00:05:13.850 I'll
00:05:14.210 take

00:05:14.390 another
00:05:14.510 game
00:05:14.900 tomorrow

00:05:19.740 sauerkraut
00:05:20.740 have
00:05:21.639 you
00:05:21.759 look
00:05:21.879 on
00:05:22.029 the
00:05:22.089 side

00:05:27.089 again
00:05:28.089 can't
00:05:28.959 hear
00:05:29.289 any
00:05:29.409 gas
00:05:29.679 coming
00:05:30.069 out
00:05:30.539 but

00:05:31.539 when
00:05:31.659 I
00:05:31.689 push
00:05:32.080 you
00:05:32.740 can
00:05:32.830 see
00:05:33.069 the
00:05:33.189 heaps
00:05:33.669 of

00:05:33.909 liquid
00:05:34.240 there
00:05:34.419 now
00:05:34.599 so
00:05:34.839 glad
00:05:35.080 I
00:05:35.110 didn't
00:05:35.889 put

00:05:36.039 any
00:05:36.159 extra
00:05:36.520 liquid
00:05:36.879 in
00:05:36.969 what
00:05:37.119 we're
00:05:37.270 just

00:05:37.389 gonna
00:05:37.539 do
00:05:37.869 just
00:05:38.800 push
00:05:38.979 it
00:05:39.129 down
00:05:39.159 so
00:05:39.819 that
00:05:39.849 the

00:05:40.229 the
00:05:41.229 layers
00:05:41.469 on
00:05:41.770 the
00:05:41.889 top
00:05:41.919 are
00:05:42.309 submerged
00:05:42.639 but

00:05:43.059 you
00:05:43.119 can
00:05:43.240 see
00:05:43.479 there's
00:05:43.809 bubbles
00:05:44.349 so
00:05:45.249 it

00:05:45.339 definitely
00:05:45.459 looks
00:05:45.849 like
00:05:45.939 fermentation
00:05:46.599 is

00:05:46.719 starting
00:05:47.080 to
00:05:47.199 Hamilton
00:05:47.649 and
00:05:47.800 sometimes
00:05:48.610 it

00:05:48.759 will
00:05:48.939 take
00:05:48.999 more
00:05:49.389 than
00:05:49.449 a
00:05:49.659 day
00:05:49.689 for
00:05:50.229 the

00:05:50.319 fermentation
00:05:50.529 is
00:05:50.919 disturbed
00:05:51.669 I'm
00:05:51.999 kind
00:05:52.360 of

00:05:52.389 surprised

00:05:52.869 winter
00:05:53.169 here
00:05:53.409 and
00:05:53.499 it's
00:05:53.649 been

00:05:53.800 really
00:05:53.979 cold
00:05:54.339 but

00:05:56.139 had
00:05:56.860 they
00:05:57.119 had
00:05:58.119 it

00:06:00.999 a
00:06:01.029 fire
00:06:01.300 going
00:06:01.629 so

00:06:01.779 that's
00:06:02.349 keeping
00:06:03.339 them
00:06:03.430 warm
00:06:03.580 enough
00:06:03.849 so
00:06:04.569 just

00:06:04.959 push
00:06:05.439 it
00:06:05.559 push
00:06:05.860 down
00:06:06.149 keep
00:06:07.149 up
00:06:07.360 on
00:06:07.629 it
00:06:07.659 and
00:06:07.899 then

00:06:08.110 just
00:06:08.499 lay
