00:00:00.390 G
00:00:00.599 here
00:00:00.780 with
00:00:00.930 natural
00:00:01.290 foods
00:00:01.530 diet
00:00:01.800 org

00:00:02.490 today
00:00:03.300 I'm
00:00:03.389 going
00:00:03.480 to
00:00:03.570 show
00:00:03.720 you
00:00:03.750 how
00:00:04.020 to
00:00:04.080 make

00:00:04.410 a
00:00:04.440 simple
00:00:05.190 fermented
00:00:05.910 food
00:00:06.120 it's
00:00:06.420 a

00:00:06.540 sauerkraut
00:00:07.080 one
00:00:07.589 of
00:00:07.740 the
00:00:08.030 original

00:00:09.030 traditional
00:00:09.450 fermented
00:00:10.440 foods
00:00:10.950 now
00:00:11.730 why
00:00:12.599 do

00:00:12.660 we
00:00:12.870 want
00:00:13.080 to
00:00:13.139 eat
00:00:13.200 fermented
00:00:13.769 foods
00:00:14.429 well

00:00:14.790 briefly
00:00:15.599 the
00:00:16.560 lacto-fermentation
00:00:17.510 process

00:00:18.590 makes
00:00:19.590 the
00:00:20.070 vegetables
00:00:20.970 more
00:00:21.210 digestible
00:00:21.650 it

00:00:22.650 preserves
00:00:23.250 them
00:00:23.519 so
00:00:24.300 let's
00:00:24.630 say
00:00:24.779 that
00:00:24.810 power

00:00:25.230 grid
00:00:25.590 goes
00:00:25.800 out
00:00:26.039 well
00:00:27.000 we
00:00:27.269 don't
00:00:27.420 need
00:00:27.630 to

00:00:27.779 refrigerate
00:00:28.140 these
00:00:28.560 foods
00:00:28.890 or
00:00:30.199 if
00:00:31.199 you

00:00:31.920 refrigerate
00:00:32.790 them
00:00:32.969 they
00:00:33.120 love
00:00:33.329 they
00:00:33.510 last
00:00:33.750 a

00:00:33.899 lot
00:00:34.079 longer

00:00:34.739 so
00:00:35.040 the
00:00:35.190 lacto-fermentation
00:00:36.980 creates
00:00:37.980 an

00:00:38.129 acidic
00:00:38.790 environment
00:00:39.059 that
00:00:39.660 doesn't
00:00:39.870 allow

00:00:40.290 pathogens
00:00:41.190 to
00:00:41.280 grow
00:00:41.579 so
00:00:41.969 it
00:00:42.480 improves
00:00:42.930 the

00:00:43.079 digestibility
00:00:43.920 it
00:00:44.850 preserves
00:00:45.570 the
00:00:46.020 food
00:00:46.770 as

00:00:47.010 well
00:00:47.489 plus
00:00:48.000 it
00:00:48.239 reduces
00:00:48.420 the
00:00:49.020 sugar
00:00:49.350 content

00:00:49.710 of
00:00:51.050 vegetables
00:00:52.050 because
00:00:52.440 the
00:00:52.969 lactobacillus

00:00:53.969 feed
00:00:54.300 on
00:00:54.480 the
00:00:54.600 sugar
00:00:54.840 so
00:00:55.559 it
00:00:55.680 makes
00:00:55.949 the
00:00:56.370 food

00:00:57.710 less
00:00:58.710 of
00:00:58.949 a
00:00:59.010 glycemic
00:00:59.520 load
00:00:59.969 for
00:01:00.510 those
00:01:00.690 with

00:01:00.989 diabetes
00:01:01.230 or
00:01:01.829 prediabetes
00:01:02.449 so
00:01:03.449 today
00:01:03.899 we're

00:01:04.199 going
00:01:04.530 to
00:01:04.710 take
00:01:05.010 a
00:01:05.309 cabbage
00:01:06.080 we
00:01:07.080 want
00:01:07.229 to
00:01:07.320 take

00:01:07.439 a
00:01:07.470 fresh
00:01:07.860 cabbage
00:01:08.220 I
00:01:08.610 got
00:01:08.820 this
00:01:09.000 from
00:01:09.330 the

00:01:09.900 farmers
00:01:10.350 market
00:01:10.380 organically
00:01:11.310 grown

00:01:12.030 I
00:01:12.140 guess
00:01:13.140 maybe
00:01:13.409 not
00:01:13.770 fresh
00:01:14.189 but
00:01:14.990 will
00:01:15.990 peel

00:01:16.320 off
00:01:16.530 this
00:01:16.770 dead
00:01:17.130 outer
00:01:17.460 layer
00:01:18.409 rivo
00:01:19.409 revealing

00:01:20.310 the
00:01:20.430 cabbage
00:01:20.820 remember
00:01:21.150 cabbage
00:01:22.080 has
00:01:22.350 many

00:01:23.189 beneficial
00:01:23.790 nutrients
00:01:24.450 and
00:01:24.840 we
00:01:25.380 make
00:01:25.619 them

00:01:25.830 more
00:01:25.860 bioavailable
00:01:26.640 we
00:01:27.540 want
00:01:27.780 to
00:01:27.900 cut
00:01:28.200 out
00:01:28.380 the

00:01:28.950 stem
00:01:29.009 so
00:01:29.909 we
00:01:30.060 slice
00:01:30.479 out
00:01:30.750 the
00:01:30.930 stem
00:01:32.750 like
00:01:33.750 this

00:01:33.780 we
00:01:34.229 want
00:01:34.439 to
00:01:34.560 save
00:01:35.240 this
00:01:36.240 organic
00:01:36.659 material
00:01:37.229 to

00:01:37.290 put
00:01:37.500 in
00:01:37.650 our
00:01:37.740 compost
00:01:38.280 we
00:01:38.610 want
00:01:38.850 to
00:01:39.150 be

00:01:40.340 efficient
00:01:41.340 and
00:01:41.549 we
00:01:41.700 want
00:01:41.939 to
00:01:42.270 create
00:01:42.659 a

00:01:42.720 sustainable
00:01:44.119 food
00:01:45.500 processing
00:01:46.500 environment

00:01:47.119 so
00:01:48.119 we
00:01:48.240 just
00:01:48.450 slice
00:01:48.990 up
00:01:49.200 the
00:01:49.320 cabbage
00:01:49.740 which
00:01:50.220 is

00:01:50.430 very
00:01:50.670 simple
00:01:51.350 you
00:01:52.350 take
00:01:52.380 the
00:01:52.710 cabbage
00:01:53.159 and
00:01:53.369 we

00:01:53.790 slice
00:01:54.149 it
00:01:54.180 into
00:01:54.570 thin
00:01:54.990 sections
00:01:55.979 if
00:01:56.369 you've

00:01:56.549 ever
00:01:57.060 eaten
00:01:57.299 sour
00:01:57.659 kraut
00:01:58.070 sauerkraut
00:01:59.070 tends

00:01:59.909 to
00:02:00.180 be
00:02:00.390 in
00:02:00.770 thin
00:02:01.770 long
00:02:02.579 strips
00:02:02.990 generally

00:02:03.990 although
00:02:04.140 you
00:02:04.320 can
00:02:04.619 do
00:02:04.740 it
00:02:04.829 any
00:02:05.009 way
00:02:05.100 you
00:02:05.310 like

00:02:06.259 next
00:02:07.259 we
00:02:07.409 want
00:02:07.710 to
00:02:07.829 take
00:02:08.129 our
00:02:08.399 shredded

00:02:08.759 cabbage
00:02:09.119 and
00:02:10.310 put
00:02:11.310 it
00:02:11.430 into
00:02:11.849 a
00:02:11.879 large
00:02:12.840 bowl

00:02:14.330 so
00:02:15.330 we'll
00:02:15.510 do
00:02:15.660 that
00:02:17.030 all
00:02:18.030 right
00:02:18.209 so
00:02:18.420 we
00:02:18.540 have

00:02:18.569 the
00:02:18.840 cabbage
00:02:19.290 in
00:02:19.470 our
00:02:19.650 bowl
00:02:21.019 so
00:02:22.019 we
00:02:22.110 take
00:02:22.349 the

00:02:22.530 bowl
00:02:22.769 and
00:02:23.190 next
00:02:23.940 we
00:02:24.060 want
00:02:24.239 to
00:02:24.300 add
00:02:24.360 sea
00:02:24.780 salt
00:02:25.700 so

00:02:26.700 we
00:02:26.879 add
00:02:27.090 some
00:02:27.840 sea
00:02:28.080 salt
00:02:28.730 sprinkle
00:02:29.730 it
00:02:29.819 in
00:02:30.590 for

00:02:31.590 one
00:02:32.400 cabbage
00:02:33.030 about
00:02:33.629 one
00:02:33.920 tablespoon
00:02:34.920 of
00:02:35.069 sea

00:02:35.310 salt
00:02:35.549 and
00:02:36.260 so
00:02:37.260 here
00:02:37.530 we
00:02:37.650 have
00:02:37.680 a
00:02:37.799 nice
00:02:38.010 bowl

00:02:38.459 full
00:02:38.760 of
00:02:38.819 cabbage
00:02:39.390 and
00:02:39.660 what
00:02:40.349 we're
00:02:40.530 going
00:02:40.799 to

00:02:40.830 do
00:02:41.129 is
00:02:41.519 squeeze
00:02:42.450 the
00:02:42.750 cabbage
00:02:43.170 with
00:02:43.379 our
00:02:43.500 hands

00:02:47.510 and
00:02:48.510 we're
00:02:48.799 squeezing
00:02:49.799 the
00:02:49.920 cabbage
00:02:50.489 to
00:02:51.180 get

00:02:51.360 the
00:02:51.540 juices
00:02:52.140 out
00:02:52.349 of
00:02:52.410 it

00:02:52.860 and
00:02:53.480 this
00:02:54.480 is
00:02:54.690 also
00:02:55.110 a
00:02:55.620 very
00:02:56.250 good
00:02:56.610 exercise
00:02:56.970 I

00:02:57.480 think
00:02:57.510 it
00:02:57.810 burns
00:02:58.079 about
00:02:58.849 900
00:02:59.849 calories
00:03:00.030 a

00:03:00.329 minute
00:03:00.650 actually
00:03:01.650 not
00:03:01.799 quite
00:03:02.040 that
00:03:02.310 many
00:03:02.690 but

00:03:03.690 I'm
00:03:03.780 sure
00:03:04.049 this
00:03:04.260 burns
00:03:04.530 lots
00:03:04.860 of
00:03:05.010 cabbage

00:03:06.260 squeezing
00:03:08.390 burns
00:03:09.390 lots
00:03:09.750 of
00:03:09.930 calories

00:03:11.150 squeezing
00:03:12.150 this
00:03:12.540 cabbage
00:03:18.109 so
00:03:19.109 we
00:03:19.230 want
00:03:19.440 to

00:03:19.530 squeeze
00:03:19.829 it
00:03:20.069 for
00:03:20.310 about
00:03:21.260 5
00:03:22.260 minutes
00:03:23.030 next

00:03:24.030 thing
00:03:24.299 we
00:03:24.450 want
00:03:24.660 to
00:03:24.720 do
00:03:24.870 is
00:03:24.989 transfer
00:03:26.299 the

00:03:27.299 cabbage
00:03:27.840 into
00:03:28.079 our
00:03:28.819 jar
00:03:29.819 and
00:03:30.150 so
00:03:30.660 we
00:03:30.810 get
00:03:30.989 some

00:03:31.349 of
00:03:31.500 the
00:03:31.620 liquid
00:03:32.540 here
00:03:33.829 as
00:03:34.829 well
00:03:35.160 as
00:03:35.310 our

00:03:35.489 cabbage
00:03:36.739 and
00:03:37.739 we
00:03:38.069 place
00:03:38.579 it
00:03:38.790 in
00:03:38.880 the
00:03:39.000 jar
00:03:39.239 we

00:03:39.420 press
00:03:39.750 it
00:03:39.930 down
00:03:43.040 now
00:03:44.040 we
00:03:44.099 put
00:03:44.609 in
00:03:44.760 about
00:03:44.940 a

00:03:45.120 tablespoon
00:03:45.569 of
00:03:46.470 sea
00:03:47.190 salt
00:03:48.109 now
00:03:49.109 in
00:03:49.290 addition

00:03:49.590 to
00:03:49.799 what
00:03:50.250 this
00:03:50.400 what
00:03:50.819 the
00:03:50.970 salt
00:03:51.209 does
00:03:51.540 is
00:03:51.810 salt

00:03:52.349 inhibits
00:03:53.340 the
00:03:53.609 growth
00:03:53.639 of
00:03:54.000 the
00:03:54.450 pathogenic

00:03:55.190 bacteria
00:03:56.190 and
00:03:56.430 that's
00:03:56.940 how
00:03:58.069 ancestrally
00:03:59.069 they

00:03:59.250 preserve
00:03:59.669 food
00:04:00.000 with
00:04:00.299 salt
00:04:00.599 and
00:04:01.109 so
00:04:01.680 it
00:04:01.769 does

00:04:01.919 the
00:04:02.040 same
00:04:02.220 thing
00:04:02.280 here
00:04:02.790 now
00:04:02.970 one
00:04:03.780 of
00:04:03.810 the

00:04:05.579 add
00:04:06.650 lactobacillus
00:04:07.880 to

00:04:08.880 our
00:04:09.209 mix
00:04:09.690 here
00:04:10.139 is
00:04:10.639 remember
00:04:11.639 we
00:04:11.819 had
00:04:12.030 a
00:04:12.060 video

00:04:12.329 on
00:04:12.599 making
00:04:12.989 way
00:04:13.200 well
00:04:13.500 we
00:04:13.530 take
00:04:13.889 the
00:04:14.700 way
00:04:15.500 that

00:04:16.500 we
00:04:16.680 made
00:04:16.919 ourselves
00:04:17.130 from
00:04:17.760 raw
00:04:18.000 goat's
00:04:18.810 milk

00:04:18.959 we
00:04:19.680 take
00:04:19.950 the
00:04:20.130 way
00:04:20.310 which
00:04:21.380 we
00:04:22.380 want
00:04:22.620 to
00:04:22.710 add

00:04:22.770 exactly
00:04:24.349 three
00:04:25.349 tablespoons
00:04:26.039 or
00:04:26.400 maybe
00:04:26.820 two

00:04:27.550 tablespoons
00:04:28.060 or
00:04:28.300 maybe
00:04:28.539 four
00:04:28.930 tablespoons
00:04:29.530 or

00:04:29.740 we
00:04:30.460 could
00:04:30.729 do
00:04:30.909 like
00:04:31.090 I
00:04:31.270 do
00:04:31.330 and
00:04:31.690 just
00:04:31.720 kind
00:04:32.110 of

00:04:32.199 pour
00:04:32.530 some
00:04:32.889 and
00:04:33.190 guess
00:04:34.180 that
00:04:34.479 it's
00:04:34.680 three
00:04:35.680 or

00:04:36.900 like
00:04:37.900 that
00:04:39.000 and
00:04:40.000 so
00:04:40.960 we'd

00:04:41.139 be
00:04:41.289 sure
00:04:41.530 be
00:04:42.490 sure
00:04:42.520 the

00:04:43.900 is

00:04:44.500 covered
00:04:45.099 with
00:04:45.759 liquid
00:04:46.000 as

00:04:50.379 of
00:04:50.830 the
00:04:51.250 liquid
00:04:51.849 then
00:04:52.060 we
00:04:52.300 don't
00:04:52.569 have
00:04:52.900 to

00:04:53.169 worry
00:04:53.500 about
00:04:54.449 too
