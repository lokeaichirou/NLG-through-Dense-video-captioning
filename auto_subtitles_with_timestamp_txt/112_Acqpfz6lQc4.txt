00:02:48.440 the
00:02:49.440 trick
00:02:49.650 is

00:02:49.830 actually
00:02:50.190 to
00:02:50.819 go
00:02:51.209 sort
00:02:51.480 of
00:02:51.569 to
00:02:51.660 the
00:02:51.780 middle
00:02:52.080 and

00:02:52.290 pull
00:02:53.010 them
00:02:53.100 into
00:02:53.400 two
00:02:53.760 and
00:02:54.390 then
00:02:54.630 keep

00:02:55.110 dividing
00:02:55.500 if
00:02:56.340 you're
00:02:56.489 having
00:02:56.610 a
00:02:56.730 problem
00:02:56.850 with

00:02:57.000 them
00:02:57.180 sticking
00:02:57.420 because
00:02:57.600 they
00:02:57.810 just

00:02:57.959 sometimes
00:02:58.290 they
00:02:58.410 really
00:02:58.620 stick
00:02:58.860 now
00:02:59.519 making

00:02:59.760 spring
00:03:00.090 rolls
00:03:00.230 is
00:03:01.230 really
00:03:01.950 is
00:03:02.040 rocket
00:03:02.400 science

00:03:02.660 and
00:03:03.660 so
00:03:03.870 it's
00:03:04.019 really
00:03:04.350 hard
00:03:04.500 and
00:03:04.920 none
00:03:05.040 of
00:03:05.070 you

00:03:05.190 will
00:03:05.220 ever
00:03:05.489 be
00:03:05.730 able
00:03:05.880 to
00:03:06.030 I
00:03:07.070 can
00:03:08.070 do
00:03:08.220 this
00:03:08.430 so

00:03:09.420 you
00:03:09.510 take
00:03:09.690 the
00:03:09.810 spring
00:03:09.989 roll
00:03:10.140 wrapper
00:03:10.350 and
00:03:10.680 you

00:03:10.890 can
00:03:11.010 also
00:03:11.160 get
00:03:11.430 these
00:03:11.579 smaller
00:03:11.910 you
00:03:12.120 can
00:03:12.239 cut

00:03:12.510 them
00:03:12.690 and
00:03:12.780 make
00:03:12.930 them
00:03:13.079 smaller
00:03:13.310 okay
00:03:14.310 you
00:03:14.610 lay

00:03:14.760 it
00:03:14.910 down
00:03:17.480 you
00:03:18.480 don't
00:03:18.690 have
00:03:18.900 to
00:03:19.110 let
00:03:19.290 this

00:03:19.380 really
00:03:19.769 seem
00:03:19.920 to
00:03:19.950 work

00:04:29.210 a
00:04:29.540 vegan
00:04:30.520 you

00:04:31.520 could
00:04:31.669 use
00:04:31.880 a
00:04:31.910 little
00:04:32.979 library
00:04:33.979 case

00:04:38.060 you
00:04:38.120 roll
00:04:38.270 it
00:04:38.300 up
00:04:38.479 and
00:04:38.780 that's
00:04:38.960 it

00:04:39.400 these
00:04:40.400 are
00:04:40.550 hard
00:04:40.760 to
00:04:41.000 make
00:04:41.180 yeah
00:04:41.630 and
00:04:41.960 they're

00:04:42.200 very
00:04:42.410 delicate
00:04:42.590 and

00:04:53.210 same
00:04:53.360 amount

00:04:53.660 so
00:04:53.780 it'll
00:04:53.930 be
00:04:53.990 slightly
00:04:54.229 different
00:04:54.620 if

00:05:02.630 the

00:05:02.750 size
00:05:02.960 I
00:05:03.260 would
00:05:03.770 put

00:05:04.040 down
00:05:04.220 and
00:05:05.030 then
00:05:05.210 I
