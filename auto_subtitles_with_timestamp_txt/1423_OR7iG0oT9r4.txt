00:00:00.269 times
00:00:01.170 are
00:00:01.350 tough
00:00:01.469 at
00:00:01.650 the
00:00:01.740 moment
00:00:01.770 we
00:00:02.399 have
00:00:02.550 to

00:00:02.639 save
00:00:02.820 money
00:00:03.090 and
00:00:03.540 we
00:00:03.600 can't
00:00:03.870 afford
00:00:03.959 them

00:00:04.290 luxury
00:00:04.710 things
00:00:04.950 like
00:00:05.190 going
00:00:05.370 over
00:00:05.580 takeaway

00:00:06.180 or
00:00:06.450 cooking
00:00:06.629 expensive
00:00:07.440 and
00:00:07.620 intricate
00:00:07.980 meals

00:00:08.189 so
00:00:08.760 I
00:00:08.790 thought
00:00:09.059 I'd
00:00:09.150 bring
00:00:09.240 back
00:00:09.480 an
00:00:09.599 old

00:00:09.660 classic
00:00:09.990 one
00:00:10.559 that
00:00:10.710 you
00:00:10.769 probably
00:00:10.950 won't
00:00:11.340 find

00:00:11.580 to
00:00:11.849 get
00:00:11.969 a
00:00:12.000 five-star
00:00:12.420 hotel
00:00:12.450 or
00:00:13.320 at
00:00:13.590 any

00:00:13.920 fancy-schmancy
00:00:14.759 dinner
00:00:14.940 parties
00:00:15.420 but
00:00:15.690 trust

00:00:16.350 me
00:00:16.440 your
00:00:16.740 family
00:00:16.949 will
00:00:17.220 love
00:00:17.340 it

00:00:17.609 it's
00:00:17.880 shepherd's
00:00:18.270 pie
00:00:18.590 other
00:00:19.590 one-putt
00:00:19.980 chef

00:00:36.920 okay
00:00:37.920 shepherd's
00:00:38.370 pie
00:00:38.610 real
00:00:39.030 easy
00:00:39.270 to
00:00:39.360 do

00:00:39.660 first
00:00:40.230 of
00:00:40.379 all
00:00:40.500 we've
00:00:40.710 got
00:00:40.739 some
00:00:41.010 garlic

00:00:41.160 infused
00:00:41.430 olive
00:00:41.820 oil
00:00:42.120 in
00:00:42.300 our
00:00:42.390 pot
00:00:42.750 which
00:00:43.020 I've

00:00:43.199 just
00:00:43.410 nice
00:00:43.590 and
00:00:43.620 heated
00:00:44.010 up
00:00:44.280 to
00:00:45.000 that
00:00:45.210 we're

00:00:45.390 going
00:00:45.570 to
00:00:45.750 add
00:00:46.019 one
00:00:46.680 small
00:00:46.949 onion
00:00:47.309 finely

00:00:47.790 chopped
00:00:48.210 I'm
00:00:48.500 cheating
00:00:49.500 I'm
00:00:49.710 using
00:00:49.980 sizzle

00:00:50.940 sizzle
00:00:51.059 sizzle
00:00:51.530 I'm
00:00:52.530 shooting
00:00:53.010 and
00:00:53.129 using

00:00:53.329 rehydrated
00:00:54.329 onion
00:00:54.629 flakes
00:00:54.900 but
00:00:55.350 feel
00:00:55.620 pretty

00:00:55.890 is
00:00:56.040 a
00:00:56.070 fresh
00:00:56.309 onion
00:00:56.610 I
00:00:56.699 just
00:00:56.940 didn't
00:00:57.390 have
00:00:57.480 one

00:00:57.690 today
00:00:58.339 so
00:00:59.420 let
00:01:00.420 that
00:01:00.570 sizzle
00:01:00.899 up
00:01:01.170 in
00:01:01.320 the
00:01:01.440 air

00:01:01.980 and
00:01:03.409 to
00:01:04.409 that
00:01:04.589 you're
00:01:04.769 going
00:01:04.979 to
00:01:05.129 add
00:01:05.720 500

00:01:06.720 grams
00:01:06.750 of
00:01:07.400 beef
00:01:08.400 mince
00:01:09.030 or
00:01:09.299 ground
00:01:09.630 beef
00:01:09.780 as

00:01:10.200 you
00:01:10.320 Americans
00:01:10.530 will
00:01:10.920 call
00:01:11.100 it
00:01:11.220 now
00:01:12.290 purists

00:01:13.290 will
00:01:13.409 say
00:01:13.619 this
00:01:13.830 isn't
00:01:13.979 shepherd's
00:01:14.430 pie
00:01:14.610 this

00:01:14.670 is
00:01:14.909 cottage
00:01:15.330 pie
00:01:15.360 because
00:01:15.960 I'm
00:01:16.080 using
00:01:16.259 beef

00:01:16.560 instead
00:01:16.950 of
00:01:17.070 land
00:01:17.369 which
00:01:17.640 is
00:01:17.670 the
00:01:17.880 traditional

00:01:18.000 one
00:01:18.450 but
00:01:19.290 long
00:01:19.950 story
00:01:19.979 short
00:01:20.520 is
00:01:20.670 it's
00:01:20.939 much

00:01:21.299 cheaper
00:01:21.330 to
00:01:21.840 feed
00:01:22.530 than
00:01:22.860 it
00:01:22.979 is
00:01:23.100 to
00:01:23.250 use
00:01:23.369 lamb

00:01:23.610 because
00:01:24.000 it's
00:01:24.150 about
00:01:24.299 twice
00:01:24.570 the
00:01:24.630 price
00:01:25.020 and
00:01:25.920 I

00:01:26.040 just
00:01:26.250 don't
00:01:26.340 think
00:01:26.490 it
00:01:26.670 has
00:01:26.759 as
00:01:26.880 much
00:01:27.090 flavor

00:01:27.330 so
00:01:28.250 we're
00:01:29.250 just
00:01:29.460 going
00:01:29.729 to
00:01:30.079 brown
00:01:31.079 this
00:01:31.290 meat

00:01:33.380 right
00:01:34.380 I
00:01:34.530 make
00:01:34.860 is
00:01:35.040 nice
00:01:35.460 browned
00:01:36.090 there
00:01:36.570 as

00:01:37.260 you
00:01:37.440 can
00:01:37.620 see
00:01:37.860 all
00:01:38.070 this
00:01:38.220 not
00:01:38.430 steamed
00:01:38.780 so
00:01:39.780 to

00:01:40.590 add
00:01:40.740 one
00:01:41.040 cup
00:01:41.070 of
00:01:41.610 beef

00:01:41.940 stock
00:01:44.270 that
00:01:45.270 just
00:01:45.920 helps
00:01:46.920 to
00:01:46.950 give
00:01:47.130 it
00:01:47.220 a
00:01:47.280 bit

00:01:47.430 more
00:01:47.810 liquidity
00:01:48.810 because
00:01:48.960 basically
00:01:49.710 what

00:01:49.830 we're
00:01:50.010 making
00:01:50.130 a

00:01:50.580 met
00:01:50.850 some
00:01:51.000 gravy
00:01:51.330 in

00:01:51.630 it
00:01:51.750 and
00:01:52.970 it
00:01:53.970 comes
00:01:54.150 out
00:01:54.330 of

00:01:55.770 liquid
00:01:55.920 in
00:01:56.100 it

00:01:56.400 a

00:01:56.640 cup
00:01:56.880 of
00:01:57.000 beef
