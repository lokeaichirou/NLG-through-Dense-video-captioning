00:00:14.490 degree

00:00:14.639 oven
00:00:15.109 so
00:00:16.109 this
00:00:16.260 is
00:00:16.440 this
00:00:16.740 is
00:00:16.920 the
00:00:17.039 dough
00:00:17.220 it

00:00:17.430 ferments

00:00:19.410 8

00:00:19.560 ounce
00:00:19.710 ball
00:00:20.100 and
00:00:20.369 you
00:00:21.210 can
00:00:21.359 tell
00:00:21.510 it's
00:00:21.660 very

00:00:21.810 loose
00:00:22.380 and
00:00:22.650 texture
00:00:23.519 and
00:00:23.699 that
00:00:24.390 is
00:00:24.539 because

00:00:24.810 the
00:00:25.019 the
00:00:25.619 gluten
00:00:25.949 has
00:00:26.070 had

00:00:28.109 in
00:00:28.470 the
00:00:28.859 refrigerator
00:00:29.279 overnight
00:00:29.550 and

00:00:30.320 develop
00:00:31.320 the
00:00:31.470 nice
00:00:31.650 bubbles
00:00:32.130 that
00:00:32.610 we're

00:00:32.759 going
00:00:32.880 to
00:00:32.940 see
00:00:33.120 on
00:00:33.300 the
00:00:33.450 edge
00:00:33.690 of
00:00:34.020 the
00:00:34.410 crust

00:00:34.649 and
00:00:34.980 then
00:00:35.370 the
00:00:35.640 tomatoes
00:00:36.149 are
00:00:36.420 a
00:00:36.450 Spanish

00:00:37.350 canned
00:00:37.829 tomato
00:00:38.190 very
00:00:39.059 similar
00:00:39.420 to
00:00:39.570 a
00:00:39.600 san

00:00:39.870 marzano
00:00:40.110 but
00:00:40.820 not
00:00:41.820 quite
00:00:42.210 as
00:00:42.360 sweet
00:00:42.629 I
00:00:42.660 like
00:00:42.870 it

00:00:43.020 to
00:00:43.110 have
00:00:43.140 a
00:00:43.260 little
00:00:43.500 bit
00:00:43.590 more
00:00:43.739 acid
00:00:43.920 than
00:00:44.190 the

00:00:44.850 San
00:00:45.030 Marzano
00:00:45.590 and
00:00:46.590 then
00:00:46.829 we
00:00:46.950 have
00:00:47.100 a
00:00:47.149 handmade

00:00:48.350 mozzarella
00:00:49.350 cheese
00:00:49.680 that's
00:00:50.190 made
00:00:50.789 in
00:00:50.910 Los

00:00:51.059 Angeles
00:00:51.510 they
00:00:51.960 make
00:00:52.140 it
00:00:52.260 daily
00:00:52.590 and
00:00:52.770 then

00:00:53.280 fresh
00:00:54.000 basil
00:00:54.239 and
00:00:54.600 then
00:00:55.320 extra-virgin
00:00:55.860 olive

00:00:57.410 okay
00:00:58.410 so
00:00:58.469 we've
00:00:58.829 replaced
00:00:59.370 the
00:00:59.550 dough

00:00:59.730 directly
00:01:00.480 into
00:01:00.780 the
00:01:00.989 Caputo
00:01:01.890 flour
00:01:02.160 that
00:01:02.430 we

00:01:02.550 import
00:01:03.059 from
00:01:03.210 Italy
00:01:03.510 it's
00:01:03.629 the
00:01:03.719 same
00:01:03.930 flour

00:01:04.260 that
00:01:04.559 we
00:01:04.650 make
00:01:04.830 the
00:01:04.979 dough
00:01:05.129 with
00:01:05.339 and
00:01:05.610 then
00:01:06.240 we

00:01:06.810 give
00:01:07.080 it
00:01:07.110 a
00:01:07.229 flip
00:01:07.500 as
00:01:08.460 I've
00:01:08.670 read
00:01:08.850 in
00:01:09.000 some
00:01:09.270 some

00:01:10.260 manuals
00:01:10.710 of
00:01:11.540 for
00:01:12.540 Italian
00:01:13.080 pizza
00:01:13.280 that
00:01:14.280 are

00:01:14.570 Neapolitan
00:01:15.570 and
00:01:15.659 style
00:01:15.930 they
00:01:16.110 say
00:01:16.259 this
00:01:16.439 is

00:01:16.650 something
00:01:17.549 you
00:01:17.640 have
00:01:17.820 to
00:01:17.850 do
00:01:18.090 in
00:01:18.240 order
00:01:18.360 for
00:01:18.659 it

00:01:18.720 to
00:01:18.750 be
00:01:18.930 traditional
00:01:19.229 you
00:01:19.650 have
00:01:19.799 to
00:01:19.950 actually

00:01:20.340 dip
00:01:20.549 it
00:01:20.670 in
00:01:20.790 the
00:01:20.880 flour
00:01:21.110 although
00:01:22.110 I'm
00:01:22.229 not

00:01:22.380 quite
00:01:22.439 sure
00:01:22.850 but
00:01:23.850 that's
00:01:24.299 what
00:01:24.479 we
00:01:24.600 do
00:01:24.720 anyway

00:01:25.580 we
00:01:26.580 sprinkle
00:01:27.000 the
00:01:27.420 surface
00:01:27.810 and
00:01:28.049 then
00:01:28.380 real

00:01:29.220 quick
00:01:29.250 we
00:01:29.610 just
00:01:29.790 give
00:01:30.360 a
00:01:30.390 squish
00:01:31.020 with
00:01:31.409 our

00:01:31.590 palm
00:01:31.770 and
00:01:32.420 make
00:01:33.420 it
00:01:33.540 flat
00:01:33.750 in
00:01:33.930 the
00:01:34.020 center
00:01:34.350 not

00:01:34.710 really
00:01:35.040 disturbing
00:01:35.549 the
00:01:35.640 outside
00:01:36.000 edge
00:01:36.240 and

00:01:36.450 then
00:01:36.960 with
00:01:37.140 our
00:01:37.290 fingertips
00:01:37.650 we
00:01:38.009 read
00:01:38.400 imple

00:01:38.790 the
00:01:38.909 rest
00:01:39.090 of
00:01:39.210 the
00:01:39.299 pizza
00:01:40.820 moving
00:01:41.820 the
00:01:41.909 pizza

00:01:42.210 around
00:01:43.310 definitely

00:01:44.710 made
00:01:44.920 definitely
00:01:45.700 handmade
00:01:46.060 not

00:01:47.830 your

00:01:47.979 best
00:01:48.010 not
00:01:48.280 to
00:01:48.340 disturb
00:01:48.760 the
00:01:49.090 edge
00:01:49.420 because

00:01:49.780 that's
00:01:49.960 where

00:01:50.799 of
00:01:51.600 natural
00:01:52.600 bubbles
00:01:53.200 from
00:01:53.500 the

00:02:02.590 the
00:02:03.400 just
00:02:03.820 the
00:02:03.940 edge

00:02:04.090 of
00:02:04.360 the
00:02:04.479 dough
00:02:04.630 out

00:02:07.960 to
00:02:08.310 disturb
00:02:09.310 the
00:02:09.610 center
00:02:10.060 the

00:02:11.050 center
00:02:11.380 generally
00:02:11.830 stretches
00:02:12.160 out
00:02:12.310 on
00:02:12.459 its

00:02:12.610 own
00:02:12.760 you
00:02:12.940 won't
00:02:13.000 have

00:02:13.480 too
00:02:13.750 much

00:02:13.780 about
00:02:13.930 it
00:02:14.260 really
00:02:14.500 just
00:02:14.800 stretching
00:02:15.640 the
00:02:15.760 edge

00:02:15.850 and
00:02:16.000 you
00:02:16.090 can
00:02:16.209 see
00:02:16.420 with
00:02:16.569 not
00:02:17.110 too
00:02:17.260 much

00:02:17.440 fanfare
00:02:18.340 we've

00:02:22.390 much
00:02:22.620 pullback
00:02:23.620 you

00:02:23.800 actually
00:02:24.100 see
00:02:24.280 almost
00:02:24.610 none

00:05:12.389 off
00:05:13.110 it
00:05:13.260 goes

00:05:17.280 generally

00:05:26.669 to
00:05:26.789 give
00:05:26.970 rise
00:05:27.240 and
00:05:28.009 the
00:05:29.009 cheese

00:05:29.820 to
00:05:30.000 kind
00:05:30.630 of
00:05:30.690 sweat
00:05:31.020 a
00:05:31.050 little
00:05:31.199 bit
00:05:31.350 the
00:05:32.190 sauce

00:05:32.789 will
00:05:33.090 start
00:05:33.570 to
00:05:33.690 boil
00:05:33.900 and
00:05:34.199 you'll
00:05:34.620 get
00:05:34.830 some

00:05:35.479 characteristic
00:05:36.479 charring
00:05:36.930 on
00:05:37.100 the
