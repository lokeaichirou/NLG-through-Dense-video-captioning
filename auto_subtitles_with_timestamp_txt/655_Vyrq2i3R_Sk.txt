00:00:55.469 a
00:00:55.559 lot
00:00:55.590 of
00:00:55.770 people
00:00:56.070 that's
00:00:56.370 it
00:00:56.640 it's

00:00:57.000 never
00:00:57.210 something
00:00:57.420 that
00:00:57.690 I
00:00:57.840 would
00:00:58.020 order
00:00:58.199 in
00:00:58.559 a

00:00:58.649 restaurant
00:00:58.680 because
00:00:59.520 I
00:00:59.550 don't
00:00:59.760 think
00:00:59.789 I've

00:01:00.989 I

00:01:01.079 don't

00:01:01.710 considered
00:01:02.250 restaurant

00:01:02.969 fare

00:01:05.159 but

00:01:05.640 there's
00:01:05.790 no
00:01:05.850 reason
00:01:06.090 why
00:01:06.180 it
00:01:06.240 shouldn't

00:01:06.450 because
00:01:06.600 the

00:02:11.580 into

00:02:12.319 says
00:02:12.620 that
00:02:13.609 golf
00:02:13.909 ball-sized
00:02:14.480 some
00:02:15.230 people

00:02:15.499 cutting
00:02:15.709 up
00:02:15.769 a
00:02:15.829 lot
00:02:15.950 smaller
00:02:16.280 which
00:02:16.519 means
00:02:16.700 up

00:02:16.790 cook
00:02:16.999 quicker
00:02:17.239 but
00:02:17.689 they
00:02:17.749 take
00:02:17.959 on
00:02:18.109 a
00:02:18.230 lot
00:02:18.409 of

00:02:18.439 water
00:02:18.680 and
00:02:19.069 become
00:02:19.249 quite
00:02:19.370 waterlogged
00:02:19.909 it's

00:02:20.239 a
00:02:20.329 wet
00:02:20.569 match
00:02:20.719 rather
00:02:21.019 than
00:02:21.349 a
00:02:21.379 nice
00:02:21.799 creamy

00:02:22.249 mesh
00:02:22.519 I
00:02:22.849 chose
00:02:23.269 a
00:02:23.299 marriage
00:02:23.629 piper
00:02:24.049 to
00:02:24.409 use

00:02:24.590 because
00:02:24.950 I
00:02:24.980 think
00:02:25.040 it
00:02:25.249 just
00:02:25.370 needs
00:02:25.519 a
00:02:25.579 fluffier

00:02:26.060 mesh
00:02:26.269 as
00:02:26.569 well
00:02:26.810 Marisa
00:02:27.319 Piper
00:02:27.709 I
00:02:27.739 don't
00:02:28.249 know

00:02:28.340 it's
00:02:29.030 type
00:02:29.269 of
00:02:29.329 potato
00:02:29.540 but
00:02:30.079 you
00:02:30.799 can
00:02:30.920 just
00:02:31.099 get

00:02:31.250 white
00:02:31.549 potatoes
00:02:32.000 now
00:02:32.180 they
00:02:32.299 call
00:02:32.480 in
00:02:32.569 just

00:02:32.750 generic
00:02:33.109 white
00:02:33.260 potatoes
00:02:33.739 or
00:02:33.980 often

00:02:34.579 supermarkets
00:02:35.150 actually
00:02:35.389 labeled
00:02:35.659 off
00:02:35.750 as

00:02:35.900 what
00:02:36.079 they're
00:02:36.200 good
00:02:36.349 for

00:02:36.590 all
00:02:37.099 these
00:02:37.370 spuds
00:02:37.670 can
00:02:37.909 go
00:02:38.030 into
00:02:38.329 our
00:02:38.810 cold

00:02:39.260 salted
00:02:39.889 water
00:02:40.099 and
00:02:40.400 the
00:02:40.669 reason
00:02:40.939 it's
00:02:41.060 cold
00:02:41.329 I

00:02:41.510 guess
00:02:41.659 another
00:02:41.840 tip
00:02:42.139 as
00:02:42.260 to
00:02:42.379 how
00:02:42.499 to
00:02:42.560 make
00:02:42.769 nan

00:02:43.159 lumpy
00:02:43.489 mashed
00:02:43.639 potato
00:02:43.909 you
00:02:44.060 wanna
00:02:44.180 cook
00:02:44.299 all

00:02:44.480 the
00:02:44.569 way
00:02:44.599 through
00:02:44.900 so
00:02:45.560 it's
00:02:45.799 a
00:02:45.829 really
00:02:46.040 hard

00:02:46.219 vegetable
00:02:46.669 you
00:02:47.090 start
00:02:47.389 with
00:02:47.569 cold
00:02:47.900 or

00:02:48.230 lukewarm
00:02:48.260 water
00:02:48.650 and
00:02:49.040 as
00:02:49.129 it
00:02:49.250 comes
00:02:49.459 up
00:02:49.700 to
00:02:49.969 a

00:02:50.000 boil
00:02:50.180 it
00:02:50.389 starts
00:02:50.780 to
00:02:50.900 cook
00:02:51.109 right
00:02:51.650 through
00:02:51.829 the

00:02:51.980 core
00:02:52.159 before
00:02:52.489 the
00:02:52.579 outsides
00:02:52.879 get
00:02:53.030 overcooked

00:02:53.389 so
00:02:53.659 bring
00:02:53.900 that
00:02:53.930 up
00:02:54.260 to
00:02:54.620 a
00:02:54.650 boil
00:02:55.040 and
00:02:55.159 they
00:02:55.280 need

00:02:55.430 to
00:02:55.489 simmer
00:02:55.699 for
00:02:55.819 a
00:02:56.000 good
00:02:56.209 15
00:02:56.810 or
00:02:56.989 20
00:02:57.290 minutes

00:02:57.469 until
00:02:57.709 they
00:02:57.799 cook
00:02:57.980 the
00:02:58.069 way
00:02:58.129 through
00:02:58.340 test

00:02:58.609 them
00:02:58.819 with
00:02:58.969 a
00:02:59.030 knife
00:02:59.269 right
00:02:59.840 now
00:03:00.079 our

00:03:00.889 shepherd's
00:03:01.250 pie
00:03:01.400 that
00:03:01.549 lamb
00:03:01.760 mixture
00:03:02.299 nice

00:03:02.930 and
00:03:03.290 cooked
00:03:03.530 all
00:03:03.769 the
00:03:03.889 way
00:03:03.919 through
00:03:03.980 and

00:03:04.459 golden
00:03:04.879 colors
00:03:05.269 starting
00:03:05.689 to
00:03:05.780 fall
00:03:05.989 we
00:03:06.439 can

00:03:06.469 add
00:03:06.709 in
00:03:06.859 all
00:03:07.040 of
00:03:07.069 our
00:03:07.219 sauce
00:03:07.489 ingredients
00:03:07.849 so

00:03:08.299 lamb
00:03:08.810 stock
00:03:09.079 and
00:03:09.709 tomato
00:03:09.829 puree

00:03:10.519 next
00:03:11.000 up
00:03:11.150 tomato
00:03:11.599 passata
00:03:11.900 now
00:03:12.290 this
00:03:12.409 isn't

00:03:12.560 quite
00:03:12.709 so
00:03:12.859 traditional
00:03:13.430 traditionally
00:03:14.120 it

00:03:14.180 would
00:03:14.239 just
00:03:14.449 be
00:03:14.540 lamb
00:03:14.750 stock
00:03:15.019 a
00:03:15.199 lot
00:03:15.319 more
00:03:15.530 of

00:03:15.650 it
00:03:15.799 and
00:03:15.980 juiced
00:03:16.340 right
00:03:16.459 down
00:03:16.939 but
00:03:17.750 when
00:03:18.079 you

00:03:18.169 guys
00:03:18.290 with
00:03:18.439 the
00:03:18.530 factory
00:03:18.889 Jamie
00:03:19.669 did
00:03:19.849 the

00:03:19.909 flavor
00:03:20.090 combination
00:03:20.569 said
00:03:20.750 it
00:03:20.840 works
00:03:21.019 really

00:03:21.199 well
00:03:21.290 with
00:03:21.409 tomatoes
00:03:22.040 they
00:03:22.159 leave
00:03:22.310 Paris

00:03:22.639 tomato
00:03:22.909 yeah
00:03:23.540 Bloody
00:03:24.049 Marys
00:03:24.530 things
00:03:24.859 like

00:03:24.979 that
00:03:25.159 so
00:03:25.579 it's
00:03:25.729 a
00:03:25.819 lot
00:03:25.939 softer
00:03:26.299 going
00:03:26.629 in
00:03:26.720 there

00:03:26.900 and
00:03:27.049 finally
00:03:27.769 we
00:03:27.919 need
00:03:28.040 to
00:03:28.159 add
00:03:28.310 in
00:03:28.699 some
00:03:29.000 Lea

00:03:29.269 and
00:03:29.419 Perrins
00:03:29.479 so
00:03:30.109 generous
00:03:30.620 splash
00:03:30.769 that
00:03:31.489 goes

00:03:31.729 in
00:03:31.849 there
00:03:32.000 and
00:03:32.060 then
00:03:32.180 just
00:03:32.209 before
00:03:32.689 we
00:03:33.019 leave

00:03:33.169 it
00:03:33.290 to
00:03:33.319 simmer
00:03:33.590 gently
00:03:33.949 for
00:03:34.220 about
00:03:35.060 an
00:03:35.150 hour
00:03:35.209 we

00:03:35.900 add
00:03:36.109 in
00:03:36.319 a
00:03:36.439 bit
00:03:36.620 more
00:03:37.009 water
00:03:37.459 now
00:03:37.819 the
00:03:38.299 reason

00:03:38.509 is
00:03:38.629 we
00:03:38.689 put
00:03:38.840 the
00:03:38.900 stock
00:03:39.079 cube
00:03:39.290 in
00:03:39.379 so
00:03:39.829 this
00:03:39.949 is

00:03:40.009 kind
00:03:40.340 of
00:03:40.400 the
00:03:40.489 balance
00:03:40.609 of
00:03:40.879 that
00:03:41.060 that
00:03:41.959 will

00:03:42.169 get
00:03:42.259 evaporated
00:03:42.349 off
00:03:42.829 and
00:03:42.979 you'll
00:03:43.069 still
00:03:43.220 be

00:03:43.310 left
00:03:43.549 in
00:03:43.669 the
00:03:43.729 same
00:03:43.879 consistency
00:03:44.329 you
00:03:44.509 started

00:03:44.930 with
00:03:45.079 accepts
00:03:45.919 her
00:03:46.009 chance
