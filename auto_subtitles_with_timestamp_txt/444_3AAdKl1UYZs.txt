00:03:32.319 exactly
00:03:32.739 what
00:03:32.949 I

00:03:33.040 don't
00:03:33.099 want
00:03:33.519 to
00:03:33.940 be
00:03:34.030 too
00:03:34.269 hot
00:03:34.739 so
00:03:35.739 now
00:03:35.949 I
00:03:35.980 take

00:03:36.430 the
00:03:36.639 pasta
00:03:37.120 and
00:03:37.389 I
00:03:37.750 put
00:03:37.989 it
00:03:38.139 into
00:03:38.500 the
00:03:38.919 yes
00:03:40.230 and

00:03:41.230 you
00:03:41.949 flavor
00:03:42.340 it
00:03:42.609 like
00:03:42.819 this
00:03:43.030 you
00:03:43.690 let
00:03:43.870 it
00:03:44.019 cool

00:03:44.410 down
00:03:44.470 in
00:03:45.160 doing
00:03:45.760 this
00:03:46.000 and
00:03:46.329 it
00:03:46.480 shouldn't
00:03:46.780 be

00:03:46.840 too
00:03:47.169 hot
00:03:47.470 because
00:03:47.879 what
00:03:48.879 is
00:03:49.060 going
00:03:49.419 to
00:03:49.449 happen

00:03:49.780 now
00:03:50.730 should
00:03:51.730 be
00:03:51.760 the
00:03:52.030 temperature
00:03:52.449 enough
00:03:53.139 to

00:03:53.650 coat
00:03:54.069 the
00:03:54.389 egg
00:03:55.389 around
00:03:55.780 the
00:03:56.379 pasta
00:03:56.829 and
00:03:57.250 now
00:03:58.150 it

00:03:58.419 comes
00:03:58.720 to
00:03:58.930 yes
00:03:59.409 the
00:03:59.769 resistance
00:04:00.400 the
00:04:01.199 actual

00:04:02.199 sauce
00:04:03.449 there
00:04:04.449 you
00:04:04.690 are
00:04:04.810 and
00:04:05.729 now
00:04:06.729 we
00:04:07.120 stir
00:04:07.750 it

00:04:07.780 like
00:04:08.139 this
00:04:09.299 this
00:04:10.299 usually
00:04:11.109 by
00:04:11.470 this
00:04:11.530 stage
00:04:12.069 the

00:04:12.729 heat
00:04:13.000 is
00:04:13.239 so
00:04:13.629 much
00:04:13.959 in
00:04:14.319 the
00:04:15.250 wrong
00:04:15.570 cooking

00:04:16.570 that
00:04:17.409 the
00:04:17.950 egg

00:04:18.900 with
00:04:19.109 some
00:04:19.320 scrambled
00:04:19.769 eggs
00:04:20.070 not
00:04:20.790 too

00:04:21.419 scrambling
00:04:22.229 and
00:04:22.500 this
00:04:23.400 is
00:04:23.669 the
00:04:24.050 carbonara
00:04:25.190 and

00:04:26.690 now
00:04:27.690 the
00:04:27.750 last
00:04:28.290 touch
00:04:29.419 which
00:04:30.419 is
00:04:30.600 the

00:04:30.780 embellishment
00:04:31.970 Parmesan
00:04:32.970 or
00:04:33.210 pecorino

00:04:34.070 depending
00:04:35.070 what
00:04:35.190 you
00:04:35.340 write
00:04:35.550 and
00:04:36.000 in
00:04:36.479 my

00:04:36.690 opinion
00:04:36.870 also
00:04:37.500 a
00:04:38.010 nice
00:04:38.310 touch
00:04:38.699 of
00:04:39.000 pepper

00:04:40.080 this
00:04:40.560 is
00:04:40.830 decoration
00:04:41.520 for
00:04:41.760 me
00:04:41.910 and
00:04:42.229 this
00:04:43.229 is

00:04:43.470 the
00:04:43.680 real
00:04:43.860 carbonara
00:04:44.699 the
00:04:45.419 only
00:04:45.810 one

00:04:46.260 this

00:04:46.800 exactly
00:04:47.400 or
00:04:47.580 should
00:04:47.790 it
00:04:47.910 be
00:04:47.970 creamy
00:04:48.810 without

00:04:49.680 adding
00:04:50.340 cream
00:04:50.669 because
00:04:51.510 this
00:04:51.690 is
00:04:51.840 the
00:04:51.990 usual
