00:01:46.530 and
00:01:47.390 I
00:01:48.390 had
00:01:48.689 a
00:01:48.720 about
00:01:49.380 1/2
00:01:49.710 TSP

00:01:50.310 of

00:01:50.640 that
00:01:50.909 you
00:01:51.119 saw
00:01:51.329 me
00:01:51.509 do
00:01:51.720 because
00:01:52.140 these

00:01:52.439 tomatoes
00:01:53.390 really
00:01:54.390 don't
00:01:54.630 have
00:01:54.780 any
00:01:55.020 salt
00:01:55.290 they

00:01:55.920 actually

00:01:56.549 a
00:01:56.579 little
00:01:56.850 bit
00:01:57.000 but
00:01:57.450 it's
00:01:58.250 says

00:01:59.250 on
00:01:59.460 the
00:01:59.610 ax
00:01:59.640 can

00:02:00.630 milligrams
00:02:01.229 per
00:02:01.649 serving

00:02:02.390 we're
00:02:03.390 American
00:02:04.229 Tomatoes
00:02:04.710 usually
00:02:05.189 have

00:02:07.649 milligrams
00:02:08.250 or
00:02:08.670 more
00:02:09.979 so
00:02:10.979 they're
00:02:11.160 virtually

00:02:12.970 and
00:02:13.780 I'm
00:02:13.900 just
00:02:14.080 gonna
00:02:14.230 let

00:02:14.680 gently

00:02:16.050 simmer
00:02:17.050 for
00:02:17.740 about
00:02:17.890 20
00:02:18.400 minutes
00:02:20.220 it's
00:02:21.220 been

00:02:21.370 going
00:02:21.750 for
00:02:22.750 20
00:02:22.900 minutes
00:02:23.410 and
00:02:23.560 I
00:02:23.770 took
00:02:24.070 some
00:02:24.550 of

00:02:24.700 the
00:02:24.820 oil
00:02:25.680 and
00:02:26.680 skim
00:02:27.070 some
00:02:27.400 of
00:02:27.550 the
00:02:27.640 oil
00:02:27.910 off
00:02:28.240 the

00:02:28.270 top
00:02:28.720 and
00:02:29.080 put
00:02:29.290 it
00:02:29.470 in
00:02:29.620 here
00:02:29.920 because
00:02:30.910 I
00:02:31.150 thought

00:02:31.330 I
00:02:31.600 put
00:02:31.630 just
00:02:32.170 a

00:02:33.360 now
00:02:34.360 I'm

00:02:34.450 going
00:02:34.630 to
00:02:34.690 add
00:02:34.810 the
00:02:35.020 beans
00:02:39.060 and
00:02:40.060 stir
00:02:40.540 those
00:02:40.750 in

00:02:41.110 and
00:02:42.450 once
00:02:43.450 it
00:02:43.630 comes
00:02:43.660 back
00:02:44.110 up
00:02:44.170 to
00:02:44.560 a
00:02:44.590 bubble

00:02:44.970 well
00:02:45.970 let

00:02:46.210 bubble
00:02:46.570 for
00:02:47.020 another
00:02:47.260 15

00:02:47.770 minutes
00:02:48.160 just
00:02:48.370 so
00:02:48.760 everything
00:02:49.330 can
00:02:49.510 kind
00:02:49.840 of

00:02:50.220 combine
00:02:51.220 and
