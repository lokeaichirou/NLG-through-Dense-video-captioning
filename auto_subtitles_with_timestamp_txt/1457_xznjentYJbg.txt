00:01:38.000 is
00:01:38.240 extremely
00:01:38.660 important
00:01:39.230 because

00:01:48.590 now
00:01:49.159 what
00:01:49.400 that
00:01:49.430 does
00:01:49.909 is

00:01:50.590 helps
00:01:51.590 take
00:01:51.950 out
00:01:52.190 some
00:01:52.940 of
00:01:53.060 the
00:01:53.150 starch
00:01:53.510 from

00:01:53.570 the
00:01:53.840 potato
00:01:54.200 that
00:01:54.890 stops
00:01:55.250 it
00:01:55.460 from
00:01:55.490 going

00:01:55.670 crispy

00:05:57.020 to
00:05:57.110 be
00:05:57.200 deep-frying
00:05:57.770 which
00:05:58.280 you

00:06:05.210 does
00:06:05.360 vary
00:06:05.690 and
