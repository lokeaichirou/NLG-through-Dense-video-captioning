00:02:50.580 blog
00:02:50.760 of
00:02:50.910 course
00:02:51.110 alright
00:02:52.110 we're
00:02:52.290 going
00:02:52.380 to
00:02:52.470 go

00:02:52.560 back
00:02:52.739 over
00:02:52.770 the
00:02:53.070 stove
00:02:53.280 check
00:02:53.550 the
00:02:53.670 onions
00:02:54.000 and

00:02:54.270 now
00:02:54.480 we're
00:02:54.840 talking
00:02:55.290 that's
00:02:55.830 what
00:02:56.489 we
00:02:56.610 want

00:02:57.150 nicely
00:02:57.900 browned
00:02:58.200 very
00:02:58.709 dark
00:02:59.040 edges
00:02:59.360 perfect

00:03:00.360 and
00:03:00.630 at
00:03:01.140 that
00:03:01.290 point
00:03:01.530 we're
00:03:01.650 going
00:03:01.739 to
00:03:01.800 back

00:03:01.980 the
00:03:02.130 heat
00:03:02.250 down
00:03:02.400 to
00:03:02.459 medium
00:03:02.940 and
00:03:03.090 dump
00:03:03.510 in
00:03:03.630 the

00:03:03.750 spices
00:03:04.050 and
00:03:04.770 we're
00:03:04.860 going
00:03:04.980 to
00:03:05.040 kind
00:03:05.190 of
00:03:05.310 toast

00:03:05.580 the
00:03:05.850 spices
00:03:05.970 in
00:03:06.540 that
00:03:06.930 hot
00:03:07.260 butter
00:03:07.560 and
00:03:07.890 that

00:03:08.160 really
00:03:08.489 wakes
00:03:08.700 up
00:03:08.910 the
00:03:09.030 flavor
00:03:09.300 and
00:03:09.660 it
00:03:09.780 really

00:03:10.170 really
00:03:10.530 adds
00:03:10.950 an
00:03:11.430 extra
00:03:11.880 dimension
00:03:12.200 which
00:03:13.200 I

00:03:13.320 guess
00:03:13.470 would
00:03:13.620 be
00:03:13.650 the
00:03:13.800 fifth
00:03:14.040 dimension
00:03:14.300 but

00:03:15.300 who's
00:03:15.420 keeping
00:03:15.630 tract
00:03:15.989 and
00:03:16.230 that
00:03:16.830 only
00:03:16.980 needs

00:03:17.250 to
00:03:17.340 cook
00:03:17.459 for
00:03:17.520 about
00:03:17.820 two
00:03:18.030 minutes
00:03:18.150 but
00:03:19.019 it

00:03:19.140 really
00:03:19.350 does
00:03:19.500 make
00:03:19.650 a
00:03:19.709 difference
00:03:19.799 all
00:03:20.580 right

00:03:20.730 after
00:03:20.910 that
00:03:21.120 we're
00:03:22.080 going
00:03:22.170 to
00:03:22.260 go
00:03:22.320 ahead
00:03:22.440 and

00:03:22.620 dump
00:03:22.799 in
00:03:22.920 the
00:03:23.100 marinade
00:03:23.489 that
00:03:23.730 was
00:03:23.850 left
00:03:24.090 over

00:03:24.239 from
00:03:24.360 the
00:03:24.630 bag
00:03:24.810 of
00:03:25.019 lamb
00:03:25.230 alright
00:03:26.130 remember

00:03:26.310 that
00:03:26.700 was
00:03:26.820 the
00:03:26.970 cider
00:03:27.239 and
00:03:27.630 the
00:03:27.720 tamarind
00:03:28.200 and

00:03:28.440 the
00:03:28.739 oil
00:03:28.980 all
00:03:29.670 right
00:03:29.790 so
00:03:29.880 I'm
00:03:29.940 going
00:03:30.030 to
00:03:30.090 dump

00:03:30.299 that
00:03:30.360 in
00:03:30.720 and
00:03:30.989 then
00:03:31.769 we're
00:03:31.860 going
00:03:31.950 to
00:03:32.010 dump
00:03:32.250 in

00:03:32.489 the
00:03:32.670 mixture
00:03:33.000 from
00:03:33.120 the
00:03:33.209 blender
00:03:33.600 the
00:03:33.840 onion

00:03:34.170 the
00:03:34.320 tomato
00:03:34.620 the
00:03:34.739 ginger
00:03:35.160 the
00:03:35.310 garlic
00:03:35.450 we're

00:03:36.450 going
00:03:36.570 to
00:03:36.630 give
00:03:36.720 that
00:03:36.750 a
00:03:36.930 stir
00:03:37.049 we're
00:03:37.920 going
00:03:38.040 to

00:03:38.100 raise
00:03:38.280 the
00:03:38.459 heat
00:03:38.640 up
00:03:38.760 to
00:03:38.910 high
00:03:38.940 we
00:03:39.510 want
00:03:39.690 to

00:03:39.750 bring
00:03:39.930 this
00:03:40.019 up
00:03:40.200 to
00:03:40.350 a
00:03:40.380 simmer
00:03:40.680 and
00:03:41.040 before
00:03:41.670 we

00:03:41.790 put
00:03:41.940 the
00:03:42.030 lamb
00:03:42.239 back
00:03:42.450 in
00:03:42.690 we're
00:03:42.900 going
00:03:42.989 to
00:03:43.049 go

00:03:43.230 ahead
00:03:43.290 and
00:03:43.500 add
00:03:43.560 a
00:03:43.590 little
00:03:43.709 bit
00:03:44.100 of
00:03:44.130 brown

00:03:44.400 sugar
00:03:44.430 all
00:03:45.209 right
00:03:45.330 just
00:03:45.510 to
00:03:45.600 balance
00:03:45.780 out
00:03:46.080 that

00:03:46.110 acidity
00:03:46.680 and
00:03:46.799 heat

00:03:47.310 alright
00:03:47.940 so
00:03:48.120 stir
00:03:48.330 that
00:03:48.480 in
00:03:48.720 and
00:03:49.019 then
00:03:49.530 we
00:03:50.340 can

00:03:50.370 place
00:03:50.700 our
00:03:50.820 lamb
00:03:51.060 back
00:03:51.330 in
00:03:51.570 and
00:03:51.870 if
00:03:52.410 using
00:03:52.739 a

00:03:52.769 similar
00:03:53.190 size
00:03:53.430 pot
00:03:53.820 you
00:03:54.450 should
00:03:54.480 have
00:03:54.810 enough

00:03:55.140 liquid
00:03:55.739 to
00:03:55.860 just
00:03:56.370 almost
00:03:56.970 come
00:03:57.180 up
00:03:57.299 to
00:03:57.420 the
00:03:57.540 top

00:03:57.750 it
00:03:58.350 doesn't
00:03:58.410 have
00:03:58.739 to
00:03:58.830 be
00:03:58.920 totally
00:03:59.100 covered

00:03:59.430 this
00:03:59.970 is
00:04:00.090 going
00:04:00.239 to
00:04:00.299 stew
00:04:00.540 for
00:04:00.750 three
00:04:00.989 hours

00:04:01.140 and
00:04:01.530 we're
00:04:01.860 going
00:04:01.980 to
00:04:02.010 turn
00:04:02.220 these
00:04:02.430 several

00:04:02.850 times
00:04:03.120 so
00:04:03.720 as
00:04:03.810 long
00:04:03.989 as
00:04:04.140 you
00:04:04.200 have
00:04:04.380 that
00:04:04.530 much

00:04:04.739 liquid
00:04:04.950 you're
00:04:05.459 okay
00:04:05.820 if
00:04:06.180 you
00:04:06.570 need
00:04:06.690 to
00:04:06.840 add

00:04:06.900 another
00:04:07.019 splash
00:04:07.440 of
00:04:07.650 water
00:04:07.830 don't
00:04:08.160 be
00:04:08.340 afraid

00:04:08.700 don't
00:04:09.060 forget
00:04:09.750 you
00:04:09.870 can
00:04:10.019 always
00:04:10.230 reduce

00:04:10.590 sauces
00:04:11.340 later

00:04:11.700 so
00:04:12.209 once
00:04:12.450 the
00:04:12.570 lamb
00:04:12.750 goes

00:04:19.320 slowly
00:04:19.829 on
00:04:20.370 very
00:04:21.150 low
00:04:21.390 heat

00:04:24.090 right
00:04:24.150 not
00:04:24.390 a

00:04:24.419 bad
00:04:24.630 idea
00:04:24.750 to
00:04:24.930 turn
00:04:25.200 it
00:04:25.320 over
00:04:25.410 once
00:04:25.650 in

00:04:27.240 you're
00:04:27.419 trying

00:04:28.440 why
00:04:29.039 there's
00:04:29.250 no

00:04:29.490 way

00:04:31.979 going
00:04:32.099 to
00:04:32.130 simmer
00:04:32.460 it
00:04:32.550 until
00:04:33.150 the

00:04:33.270 meats
00:04:33.479 tender
00:04:33.720 see
00:04:34.560 how
00:04:34.650 that
00:04:34.800 fork
00:04:35.039 goes

00:04:35.190 right
00:04:35.370 into
00:04:35.520 that
00:04:35.610 meat
00:04:35.940 that's
00:04:36.330 done
