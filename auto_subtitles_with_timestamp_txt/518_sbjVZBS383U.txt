00:04:36.630 to
00:04:36.720 coat
00:04:36.930 the
00:04:37.380 all
00:04:38.010 the

00:04:38.190 ingredients
00:04:38.610 so
00:04:38.789 to
00:04:39.690 keep
00:04:39.870 it
00:04:39.990 from
00:04:40.080 oxidizing

00:04:40.260 you
00:04:40.830 don't
00:04:40.979 want
00:04:41.100 them
00:04:41.190 to
00:04:41.280 turn
00:04:41.430 brown
00:04:41.669 that's

00:04:42.180 what
00:04:42.330 the
00:04:42.419 lemon
00:04:42.690 juice
00:04:42.840 will
00:04:43.440 do
00:04:43.639 so
00:04:44.639 the

00:04:44.760 dressing
00:04:45.120 actually
00:04:45.510 helps
00:04:45.780 prevent
00:04:46.199 the

00:04:46.289 apples
00:04:46.710 from
00:04:46.919 oxidizing
00:04:47.400 that's
00:04:47.910 it
00:04:48.090 now

00:04:49.050 we'll
00:04:49.289 play
00:04:50.160 the
00:04:50.220 salad
00:04:50.699 how
00:04:51.000 necessary
00:04:51.240 is

00:04:51.690 that
00:04:51.870 ring
00:04:52.050 mold
00:04:52.289 it's
00:04:52.770 not
00:04:52.919 really
00:04:53.130 necessary

00:04:53.520 at
00:04:53.610 all
00:04:53.729 but
00:04:53.970 they
00:04:54.270 say
00:04:54.479 we
00:04:54.780 with
00:04:54.960 our
00:04:55.110 eyes

00:04:55.229 first
00:04:55.260 so
00:04:55.740 it's
00:04:55.889 all
00:04:56.010 about
00:04:56.039 height

00:04:56.760 presentation
00:04:57.570 and
00:04:57.690 color
00:04:57.870 that's
00:04:58.139 that's
00:04:58.440 why

00:04:58.590 we
00:04:58.710 use
00:04:58.830 the
00:04:59.039 remote
00:04:59.580 it's
00:05:00.270 like
00:05:00.450 the
00:05:00.599 leaning

00:05:00.930 tower
00:05:01.110 of
00:05:01.289 Apple
00:05:01.740 crate
00:05:02.660 so
00:05:03.660 we'll
00:05:03.900 just

00:05:04.080 garnish
00:05:04.590 the
00:05:04.830 plate
00:05:04.860 with
00:05:05.930 some
00:05:06.930 red
00:05:07.139 grapes

00:05:08.479 add
00:05:09.479 a
00:05:09.539 bit
00:05:09.690 of
00:05:09.720 color
00:05:09.990 some
00:05:10.740 of
00:05:10.770 our
00:05:10.950 walnuts

00:05:12.860 and
00:05:13.460 then
00:05:13.910 these
00:05:14.030 are
00:05:14.090 microgreens
00:05:14.780 you'd
00:05:15.020 use

00:05:15.170 the
00:05:15.320 leaves
00:05:15.530 the
00:05:16.340 leaves
00:05:16.460 from
00:05:16.670 the
00:05:16.760 celery

00:05:18.530 just
00:05:19.190 for
00:05:19.310 color

00:05:19.490 and
00:05:19.670 a
00:05:19.760 little
00:05:19.910 bit
00:05:20.060 more

00:05:27.620 me

00:05:27.800 really
00:05:28.130 hungry

00:05:28.610 it

00:05:28.970 delicious
00:05:29.150 and
00:05:29.630 I
00:05:29.720 can't
00:05:30.020 wait

00:05:30.470 try
00:05:30.680 it
00:05:30.920 I
00:05:33.670 love
00:05:34.670 the
00:05:34.970 nuttiness
00:05:35.300 of

00:05:36.260 are
00:05:36.380 just
00:05:36.740 sweet
00:05:37.010 enough

00:05:37.460 combined
00:05:37.730 with
00:05:37.760 the
00:05:38.000 Crisp
00:05:38.240 Apple
00:05:38.660 texture
00:05:39.170 it

00:05:39.410 seems
00:05:39.680 like
00:05:39.860 something
00:05:40.100 to
00:05:40.190 be
00:05:40.220 heavy
00:05:40.460 but
00:05:40.640 it
