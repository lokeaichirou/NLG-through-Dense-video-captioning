00:00:54.360 just
00:00:54.510 makes
00:00:54.690 it
00:00:54.780 easier

00:00:55.170 then
00:00:55.320 keep

00:01:05.729 it's
00:01:06.600 quite
00:01:06.810 nice
00:01:07.020 to
00:01:07.200 keep
00:01:07.320 it

00:01:07.440 quite

00:01:09.720 to
00:01:10.520 blitz
00:01:11.520 up

00:01:11.790 it
00:01:11.970 doesn't
00:01:12.180 really
00:01:12.270 matter
00:01:12.510 to
00:01:12.780 be
00:01:12.900 honest
00:01:13.200 as

00:01:13.320 long
00:01:13.470 as
00:01:13.619 you
00:01:13.710 get
00:01:13.829 lots
00:01:14.009 of
00:01:14.100 lovely
00:01:14.280 color
00:01:14.579 and

00:01:14.820 you
00:01:14.939 soften
00:01:15.299 it
00:01:15.420 you're
00:01:15.539 going
00:01:15.659 to
00:01:15.719 bliss
00:01:15.930 up

00:01:16.170 anyway
00:01:16.590 so
00:01:18.590 slice
00:01:19.590 up
00:01:19.770 your
00:01:19.799 celery
00:01:20.659 fish

00:01:21.659 that's
00:01:21.930 one
00:01:22.170 side
00:01:22.560 and
00:01:23.600 now
00:01:24.600 with
00:01:24.719 the
00:01:24.810 carrots

00:01:26.060 depends
00:01:27.060 on
00:01:27.119 how
00:01:27.600 you
00:01:27.930 know
00:01:28.289 small
00:01:28.710 or
00:01:29.039 fresher

00:01:29.490 carrots
00:01:29.909 are
00:01:30.030 you
00:01:30.149 can
00:01:30.270 peel
00:01:30.479 with
00:01:30.600 them
00:01:30.719 I'll

00:01:30.780 just
00:01:30.810 describe
00:01:31.229 them

00:01:31.619 just
00:01:32.250 let
00:01:32.460 peel
00:01:32.789 these

00:01:52.189 remove
00:01:53.189 the
00:01:53.310 onion
00:01:53.689 cuts
00:01:54.689 it
00:01:54.869 in
00:01:54.930 half

00:01:55.530 I
00:01:55.560 always
00:01:55.740 find
00:01:56.009 it
00:01:56.130 easier
00:01:56.460 to
00:01:56.549 take
00:01:56.670 the

00:01:57.630 outside
00:01:58.020 off
00:01:58.560 if
00:01:58.829 you
00:01:58.890 cut
00:01:59.070 in
00:01:59.189 half
00:01:59.369 first

00:01:59.640 keep
00:02:00.450 the
00:02:00.600 root
00:02:00.840 intact
00:02:01.670 because
00:02:02.670 that's

00:02:02.970 where
00:02:03.270 that
00:02:03.479 will
00:02:03.630 help
00:02:03.810 keep
00:02:04.110 the
00:02:04.320 onion

00:02:04.590 layers
00:02:04.740 together
00:02:05.090 so
00:02:06.090 when
00:02:06.179 you're
00:02:06.210 cutting

00:02:06.450 it
00:02:06.750 won't
00:02:06.899 fall
00:02:07.170 apart
00:02:07.200 if
00:02:07.679 you
00:02:07.799 chop
00:02:08.099 that
00:02:08.340 off

00:02:08.750 then
00:02:09.750 you'll
00:02:09.869 be
00:02:09.959 in
00:02:10.050 trouble
00:02:10.140 because
00:02:10.470 then

00:02:10.739 all
00:02:10.860 the
00:02:11.039 layers
00:02:11.489 will
00:02:11.730 fall
00:02:11.880 apart
00:02:12.150 and

00:02:12.360 you'll
00:02:12.480 make
00:02:12.690 it
00:02:12.870 much
00:02:13.080 harder
00:02:13.290 to
00:02:13.590 chop
00:02:13.800 so

00:02:14.580 keep
00:02:14.819 that
00:02:14.970 whole
00:02:15.209 and
00:02:15.569 you
00:02:15.720 can
00:02:15.840 just
00:02:15.959 discard

00:02:16.230 it
00:02:16.440 at
00:02:16.530 the
00:02:16.650 end
00:02:16.769 and
00:02:20.120 again
00:02:21.120 kind
00:02:21.450 of
00:02:21.510 onions

00:02:21.870 as
00:02:22.640 fine
00:02:23.640 or
00:02:24.000 chunky
00:02:24.420 as
00:02:24.480 you
00:02:24.569 like
00:02:25.010 depending

00:02:26.010 on
00:02:26.370 your
00:02:26.430 type
00:02:26.610 of
00:02:26.760 soup
00:02:29.269 and
00:02:30.269 then
00:02:30.450 feed

00:02:30.660 garlic
00:02:32.330 just
00:02:33.330 need
00:02:33.540 a
00:02:33.569 couple
00:02:33.810 of
00:02:33.900 cloves

00:02:40.050 I
00:02:42.740 just
00:02:43.740 cut
00:02:43.950 off
00:02:43.980 the
00:02:44.130 end
00:02:44.370 just
00:02:44.610 to
00:02:44.670 make
00:02:44.730 a

00:02:44.850 bit
00:02:45.030 easier
00:02:45.360 to
00:02:45.390 crush
00:02:45.690 get
00:02:46.140 the
00:02:46.230 skins
00:02:46.530 off
00:02:47.840 so

00:02:48.840 put
00:02:49.050 the
00:02:49.170 flats
00:02:49.550 of
00:02:50.550 your
00:02:50.880 knife
00:02:51.090 on
00:02:51.420 top
00:02:51.810 of

00:02:51.930 the
00:02:51.990 garlic
00:02:52.200 using
00:02:52.680 the
00:02:52.740 palm
00:02:52.920 your
00:02:53.100 hair
00:02:53.220 and

00:02:53.340 just
00:02:53.490 push
00:02:53.700 down
00:02:53.730 let's
00:02:54.720 push
00:02:54.870 too
00:02:55.080 hard
00:02:55.110 and

00:02:55.950 this
00:02:56.610 is
00:02:56.760 the
00:02:56.850 easiest
00:02:57.060 way
00:02:57.270 to
00:02:57.330 get
00:02:57.570 the
00:02:57.660 skin

00:02:57.900 off
00:02:57.930 and
00:02:58.710 again
00:02:59.130 you
00:02:59.310 can
00:02:59.460 slice
00:02:59.760 or
00:02:59.970 chop
00:03:00.120 your

00:03:00.270 garlic
00:03:00.300 I
00:03:00.690 like
00:03:00.720 to
00:03:00.990 slice
00:03:01.260 it
00:03:01.530 just
00:03:02.160 because
00:03:02.370 I

00:03:02.430 don't
00:03:02.490 like
00:03:02.610 it
00:03:02.850 to
00:03:02.940 burn
00:03:03.120 or
00:03:03.300 catch
00:03:03.480 too

00:03:03.690 easily
00:03:03.840 and
00:03:04.080 if
00:03:04.140 you
00:03:04.200 chop
00:03:04.380 it
00:03:04.410 too
00:03:04.620 fine
00:03:04.950 it

00:03:05.190 can
00:03:05.340 catch
00:03:06.000 an
00:03:06.210 even
00:03:06.390 really
00:03:06.570 bitter
00:03:06.780 taste
00:03:07.140 so

00:03:08.130 just
00:03:08.340 slice
00:03:08.550 it
00:03:08.580 quite
00:03:08.940 fine

00:03:13.920 you
00:03:13.980 have
00:03:14.100 to
00:03:14.220 do
00:03:14.310 now
00:03:14.490 is
