00:02:14.370 all
00:02:14.430 stirred
00:02:14.760 in
00:02:14.970 it
00:02:15.390 looks

00:02:15.570 like
00:02:15.750 this
00:02:15.990 you
00:02:16.170 can
00:02:16.320 start
00:02:16.530 adding
00:02:16.800 your

00:02:16.830 cream
00:02:17.600 just
00:02:18.600 going

00:02:18.810 add
00:02:18.930 a
00:02:18.960 little
00:02:19.230 bit
00:02:19.380 at

00:02:19.500 a
00:02:19.530 time
00:02:21.950 you
00:02:22.950 want
00:02:23.130 to
00:02:23.220 control
00:02:23.610 this
00:02:23.880 so
00:02:24.750 you

00:02:24.840 don't
00:02:25.020 ruin
00:02:25.320 it
00:02:26.540 but
00:02:27.540 as
00:02:27.750 the
00:02:27.780 Heat's
00:02:28.200 on
00:02:28.440 which

00:02:28.890 is
00:02:29.100 about
00:02:29.310 a
00:02:29.370 medium
00:02:29.640 I
00:02:30.000 need
00:02:30.380 got
00:02:31.380 to
00:02:31.530 watch

00:02:31.680 the
00:02:31.920 bottom
00:02:32.220 of
00:02:32.340 your
00:02:32.430 pan
00:02:32.700 especially
00:02:33.300 if

00:02:33.390 your
00:02:33.510 pans
00:02:33.720 then
00:02:35.420 make
00:02:36.420 sure
00:02:36.600 you
00:02:36.720 don't
00:02:36.810 burn

00:02:37.110 it
00:02:37.320 on
00:02:37.410 the
00:02:37.530 bottom
00:02:37.920 it
00:02:38.130 will
00:02:38.250 ruin
00:02:38.550 the
00:02:38.730 entire

00:02:39.120 suit
00:02:39.950 once
00:02:40.950 you
00:02:41.070 bring
00:02:41.280 it
00:02:41.430 up
00:02:41.520 to
00:02:41.850 the
00:02:41.970 top

00:02:42.210 here
00:02:43.730 stir
00:02:44.730 it
00:02:44.880 all
00:02:45.000 in
00:02:45.170 give
00:02:46.170 it
00:02:46.290 a
00:02:46.350 good
00:02:46.500 taste

00:02:48.020 because
00:02:49.020 at
00:02:49.530 this
00:02:49.740 point
00:02:50.040 we
00:02:50.190 need
00:02:50.460 to
00:02:50.550 know
00:02:50.730 if

00:02:50.880 we
00:02:51.000 can
00:02:51.120 add
00:02:51.300 pepper
00:02:51.630 salt
00:02:53.300 whatever
00:02:54.300 you'd

00:02:54.480 like
00:02:54.510 in
00:02:54.900 a
00:02:55.050 bit
00:02:55.320 we're
00:02:55.830 going
00:02:55.950 to
00:02:56.010 add
00:02:56.100 the

00:02:56.280 pepper
00:02:56.520 for
00:02:56.790 sure
00:02:56.970 you
00:02:57.870 get
00:02:58.020 a
00:02:58.050 lot
00:02:58.260 of
00:02:58.380 salt

00:02:58.620 from
00:02:58.800 our
00:02:58.980 bacon
00:02:59.490 and
00:02:59.870 from
00:03:00.870 the
00:03:01.110 canned
00:03:01.680 clams

00:03:02.720 so
00:03:03.720 we're
00:03:03.870 not
00:03:03.990 going
00:03:04.200 to
00:03:04.260 add
00:03:04.440 too
00:03:04.710 much
00:03:04.920 salt

00:03:05.310 but
00:03:06.270 it
00:03:06.360 does
00:03:06.570 need
00:03:06.780 a
00:03:06.810 little
00:03:06.990 bit
00:03:08.000 it's

00:03:09.000 important
00:03:09.480 to
00:03:09.570 have
00:03:09.690 this
00:03:09.990 flavor
00:03:10.410 before
00:03:11.400 the

00:03:11.790 whole
00:03:11.970 cooking
00:03:12.270 of
00:03:12.510 the
00:03:12.540 soup
00:03:12.870 because
00:03:13.350 it

00:03:13.380 will
00:03:14.190 infuse
00:03:14.690 and
00:03:15.690 make
00:03:15.870 it
00:03:15.990 taste
00:03:16.230 better
00:03:16.350 in

00:03:16.650 the
00:03:16.740 long
00:03:16.920 run
00:03:17.300 now
00:03:18.300 the
00:03:18.330 potatoes
00:03:18.690 that
00:03:19.020 I'm

00:03:19.170 adding
00:03:19.530 here
00:03:19.770 obviously
00:03:20.760 need
00:03:21.270 to
00:03:21.300 be
00:03:21.480 cooked

00:03:21.690 here
00:03:21.990 for
00:03:22.200 a
00:03:22.230 little
00:03:22.410 while
00:03:22.560 but
00:03:23.430 the
00:03:23.610 stars
00:03:23.970 of

00:03:24.150 the
00:03:24.209 potato
00:03:24.510 is
00:03:24.600 going
00:03:24.780 to
00:03:24.840 help
00:03:24.990 it
00:03:25.140 thicken

00:03:25.350 up
00:03:25.650 as
00:03:26.130 it
00:03:26.400 reduces

00:03:28.020 and
00:03:28.440 once
00:03:28.620 again
00:03:28.770 make
00:03:29.130 sure
00:03:29.190 you
00:03:29.520 have
00:03:29.550 it
00:03:29.850 all

00:03:29.970 off
00:03:30.210 the
00:03:30.360 bottom
00:03:30.690 of
00:03:30.780 the
00:03:30.840 pan
00:03:31.140 so
00:03:31.410 you
00:03:31.470 don't

00:03:31.680 you
00:03:32.520 don't
00:03:32.640 burn
00:03:32.940 it
00:03:33.180 and
00:03:33.330 send
00:03:33.570 that
00:03:33.630 flavor

00:03:34.020 through
00:03:34.350 the
00:03:34.440 whole
00:03:34.620 soup
00:03:35.550 but
00:03:35.880 rolling
00:03:36.210 it

00:03:38.390 very
00:03:39.390 tedious
00:03:39.780 process
00:03:40.260 but
00:03:40.610 well
00:03:41.610 worth
00:03:41.850 it

00:03:42.060 at
00:03:42.180 the
00:03:42.330 end
00:03:43.040 just
00:03:44.040 mix
00:03:44.340 it
00:03:44.490 all
00:03:44.580 up
00:03:44.640 make
00:03:45.090 sure

00:03:45.270 it's
00:03:45.450 all
00:03:45.660 good
00:03:45.690 to
00:03:46.200 go

00:03:46.410 see
00:03:47.220 it's
00:03:47.400 thin
00:03:47.670 enough
00:03:47.850 force

00:03:54.640 but
00:03:55.060 now
00:03:55.210 I
00:03:55.240 need
00:03:55.510 to
00:03:55.630 ensure
00:03:55.930 that
00:03:55.960 potatoes

00:03:56.890 are
00:03:57.040 completely
00:03:57.160 cooked
00:03:57.760 all
00:03:57.940 the
00:03:58.000 way

00:03:58.060 through
00:03:58.560 almost
00:03:59.560 like
00:03:59.740 they
00:03:59.920 are
00:04:00.069 so
00:04:01.230 we'll
00:04:02.230 be

00:04:02.440 adding
00:04:02.470 our
00:04:02.860 last
00:04:03.190 ingredient
00:04:04.230 which
