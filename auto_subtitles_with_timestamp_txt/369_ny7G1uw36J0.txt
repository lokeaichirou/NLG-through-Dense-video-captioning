00:00:06.299 AM
00:00:06.509 and
00:00:07.130 last
00:00:08.130 couple

00:00:08.490 days
00:00:08.670 she's
00:00:08.940 been
00:00:08.970 keeping
00:00:09.300 it

00:00:09.750 simple

00:00:10.110 and
00:00:10.759 I
00:00:11.759 needed

00:00:12.150 make
00:00:12.300 a
00:00:12.330 video
00:00:12.990 so
00:00:13.590 I
00:00:13.730 wanted

00:00:14.730 to
00:00:14.820 do
00:00:14.880 something
00:00:15.210 special
00:00:15.240 for
00:00:15.630 you
00:00:15.839 guys
00:00:15.870 so

00:00:16.289 I
