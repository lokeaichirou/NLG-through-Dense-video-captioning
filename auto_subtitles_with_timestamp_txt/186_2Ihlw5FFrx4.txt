00:02:20.660 like
00:02:20.930 to
00:02:20.960 add
00:02:21.140 salt
00:02:21.410 and
00:02:21.530 pepper
00:02:21.560 to

00:02:21.770 all
00:02:22.280 of
00:02:22.430 my
00:02:22.550 sandwiches
00:02:23.110 and
00:02:24.110 then
00:02:24.350 we'll
00:02:24.530 put

00:02:24.680 the
00:02:24.800 last
00:02:25.780 slice
00:02:26.780 of
00:02:26.810 bread
00:02:27.080 here
00:02:27.710 mm-hmm
00:02:28.400 and

00:02:30.230 half
00:02:31.030 that's
00:02:32.030 a
00:02:32.120 big

00:02:34.060 well
00:02:35.060 the

00:02:35.390 makes
00:02:35.630 it
00:02:35.810 very

00:02:36.250 voluminous
00:02:37.250 but
00:02:37.940 I

00:02:38.810 that
00:02:38.960 it
00:02:39.200 really

00:02:39.410 helps
00:02:39.800 the
00:02:40.010 crispness
00:02:40.730 of
00:02:40.970 it
