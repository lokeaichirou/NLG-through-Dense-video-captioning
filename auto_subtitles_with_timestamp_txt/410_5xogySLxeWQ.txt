00:01:15.119 parsley
00:01:15.630 salad
00:01:15.869 refusing

00:01:19.950 love
00:01:20.490 it
00:01:20.610 so
00:01:20.640 much

00:01:20.820 I
00:01:21.090 make
00:01:21.299 it
00:01:21.420 every
00:01:21.659 week
00:01:21.840 when
00:01:22.020 the

00:01:22.110 ingredients
00:01:22.560 are
00:01:22.650 in
