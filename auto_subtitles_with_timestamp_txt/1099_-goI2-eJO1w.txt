00:02:59.610 simmer
00:02:59.819 uncovered

00:03:00.150 for
00:03:00.599 about
00:03:01.110 an
00:03:01.770 hour
00:03:01.920 okay
00:03:02.580 one
00:03:03.330 hour
00:03:03.360 later

00:03:03.810 this
00:03:04.050 is
00:03:04.170 what
00:03:04.380 we're
00:03:04.560 looking
00:03:04.590 at
00:03:04.890 I
00:03:04.980 just

00:03:05.130 stirred
00:03:05.489 this
00:03:05.670 about
00:03:05.970 every
00:03:06.330 15
00:03:06.900 minutes
00:03:07.080 or

00:03:07.319 so
00:03:07.530 and
00:03:07.950 now
00:03:08.010 at
00:03:08.489 the
00:03:08.610 very
00:03:08.640 end
00:03:09.360 give
00:03:09.959 it
00:03:10.050 a

00:03:10.110 taste
00:03:10.290 add
00:03:10.620 some
00:03:10.800 salt
00:03:11.010 if
00:03:11.160 you
00:03:11.250 think
00:03:11.400 it

00:03:11.489 needs
00:03:11.580 it
00:03:11.760 but
00:03:12.390 remember
00:03:12.690 the
00:03:12.810 hot
00:03:12.989 dogs

00:03:13.170 usually
00:03:13.349 pretty
00:03:13.709 salty
00:03:14.040 too
00:03:14.190 so
00:03:14.610 maybe
00:03:14.819 you

00:03:15.420 could
00:03:15.540 under
00:03:15.810 Celt
00:03:16.019 it
00:03:16.170 I'm
00:03:16.319 just
00:03:16.500 gonna
00:03:16.650 add
00:03:16.890 a

00:03:17.190 little
00:03:18.060 touch
00:03:18.330 just
00:03:18.840 a
00:03:18.959 smidge
00:03:19.200 of
00:03:19.500 some
00:03:19.650 apple

00:03:19.920 cider
00:03:20.040 vinegar
00:03:20.660 and
00:03:21.660 I
00:03:22.130 happen
00:03:23.130 to
00:03:23.160 love

00:03:23.489 vinegar
00:03:24.060 and
00:03:24.299 sour
00:03:24.510 things
00:03:24.870 not
00:03:25.200 that
00:03:25.290 that

00:03:25.440 really
00:03:25.739 makes
00:03:25.920 this
00:03:26.100 like
00:03:26.400 sour
00:03:26.640 but
00:03:26.910 I
00:03:26.940 just

00:03:27.120 think
00:03:27.299 it
00:03:27.360 makes
00:03:27.690 it
00:03:27.810 taste
00:03:28.019 more
00:03:28.290 like
00:03:28.400 chili

00:03:29.400 dog
00:03:29.549 chili
00:03:29.819 but
00:03:30.420 it's
00:03:30.690 optional
00:03:31.110 if
00:03:31.260 you
00:03:31.319 you

00:03:32.250 know
00:03:32.340 just
00:03:32.580 give
00:03:32.730 it
00:03:32.819 a
00:03:32.850 taste
00:03:33.000 if
00:03:33.720 it
00:03:33.900 seems
00:03:34.440 a

00:03:34.560 little
00:03:34.680 bit
00:03:34.860 like
00:03:35.849 it
00:03:35.970 needs
00:03:36.120 a
00:03:36.209 little
00:03:36.299 perk

00:03:36.780 then
00:03:37.170 try
00:03:37.830 a
00:03:37.860 little
00:03:38.069 bit
00:03:38.160 of

00:03:38.489 that's

00:03:38.640 a
00:03:38.940 good
00:03:39.150 tip
