00:00:18.779 couple

00:00:19.320 years
00:00:19.439 ago
00:00:19.680 I
00:00:20.070 was
00:00:20.250 having
00:00:20.369 issues
00:00:20.699 with
00:00:21.000 my

00:00:21.510 digestive
00:00:22.050 tract
00:00:22.320 and
00:00:22.590 I
00:00:23.189 think
00:00:23.400 actually

00:00:23.640 what
00:00:24.000 caused
00:00:24.240 it
00:00:24.449 is
00:00:24.600 I
00:00:24.720 was
00:00:25.490 working

00:00:26.490 somewhere
00:00:26.760 where
00:00:27.029 I
00:00:27.060 was
00:00:27.240 getting
00:00:27.480 really

00:00:27.869 sick
00:00:28.199 all
00:00:28.380 the
00:00:28.410 time

00:00:28.650 and
00:00:28.859 so
00:00:28.949 I
00:00:29.010 had
00:00:29.160 gone
00:00:29.310 through
00:00:29.369 a
00:00:29.609 few
00:00:30.029 courses

00:00:30.300 of
00:00:30.539 antibiotics
00:00:30.779 and
00:00:31.410 my
00:00:31.590 stomach
00:00:32.009 was
00:00:32.160 just

00:00:32.189 giving
00:00:32.850 me
00:00:32.969 so
00:00:33.120 many
00:00:33.210 problems
00:00:33.420 and
00:00:33.899 I
00:00:34.320 knew
00:00:34.530 a

00:00:34.559 way
00:00:34.920 to
00:00:34.980 fix
00:00:35.309 it
00:00:35.430 naturally
00:00:35.880 was
00:00:36.149 through

00:00:36.420 probiotics
00:00:37.110 but
00:00:37.350 I
00:00:37.649 didn't
00:00:38.280 want
00:00:38.430 to
00:00:38.489 use

00:00:38.610 something
00:00:39.030 that
00:00:39.210 was
00:00:39.829 full
00:00:40.829 of
00:00:41.270 animal

00:00:42.270 product
00:00:43.140 so
00:00:43.379 I
00:00:43.620 didn't
00:00:43.890 want
00:00:44.010 to
00:00:44.100 use
00:00:44.219 like
00:00:44.430 a

00:00:44.489 kefir
00:00:45.030 or
00:00:45.770 one
00:00:46.770 of
00:00:46.890 those
00:00:47.039 expensive
00:00:47.850 things

00:00:48.059 that
00:00:48.239 they
00:00:48.329 sell
00:00:48.539 in
00:00:48.629 Whole
00:00:48.780 Foods
00:00:48.809 like
00:00:49.200 in

00:00:49.379 glass
00:00:49.590 bottles
00:00:49.980 its
00:00:50.250 probiotic
00:00:50.969 which
00:00:51.149 is

00:00:51.300 great
00:00:51.510 but
00:00:51.690 the
00:00:51.750 majority
00:00:52.320 that
00:00:52.620 comes
00:00:52.829 from

00:00:53.010 milk
00:00:53.219 also
00:00:54.059 I
00:00:54.559 believe
00:00:55.559 that
00:00:55.920 kombucha
00:00:56.460 has

00:00:56.489 great
00:00:57.000 probiotic
00:00:57.660 properties
00:00:58.410 but
00:00:58.649 I
00:00:58.680 was
00:00:58.890 out

00:00:59.129 of
00:00:59.489 town
00:01:00.300 at
00:01:00.570 the
00:01:00.660 time
00:01:00.690 and
00:01:01.079 didn't
00:01:01.260 have

00:01:01.379 access
00:01:01.800 to
00:01:01.980 a
00:01:02.010 kitchen
00:01:02.399 so
00:01:02.879 I
00:01:03.979 was
00:01:04.979 not
00:01:05.430 wanting

00:01:05.610 to
00:01:05.850 spend
00:01:06.030 4
00:01:06.360 dollars
00:01:06.720 every
00:01:06.990 single
00:01:07.320 day
00:01:07.409 to

00:01:07.470 buy
00:01:07.710 a
00:01:07.740 kombucha
00:01:08.570 so
00:01:09.570 this
00:01:09.840 is
00:01:09.990 something
00:01:10.320 that

00:01:10.350 I
00:01:10.830 kind
00:01:11.369 of
00:01:11.430 through
00:01:11.909 the

00:01:15.330 really
00:01:15.630 enjoy
00:01:15.960 when
00:01:16.229 I
00:01:16.259 was

00:01:28.530 and
00:01:28.710 then
00:01:29.130 I
00:01:29.250 realized
00:01:29.750 after

00:05:36.220 with
00:05:36.760 the
00:05:37.000 lid
00:05:37.210 on
00:05:37.390 but
00:05:38.020 not

00:05:38.260 screwed
00:05:38.800 on
00:05:39.040 tight

00:05:39.730 you
00:05:39.940 want
00:05:40.240 it
00:05:40.390 to
00:05:41.280 be
00:05:42.720 covered
00:05:43.720 so
00:05:44.050 that
00:05:44.080 junk

00:05:44.890 doesn't
00:05:45.100 get

00:05:47.650 six
00:05:47.980 days
00:05:48.160 but
00:05:48.820 you

00:05:48.910 don't
00:05:49.240 want

00:05:49.630 close
00:05:49.840 the
00:05:49.990 lid
00:05:50.170 because

00:05:50.320 it'll
00:05:50.650 stop
00:05:50.830 the

00:05:51.160 process
00:05:51.580 and

00:05:52.180 you

00:05:53.950 the
00:05:53.980 lid
00:05:54.250 closed
00:05:54.460 because
00:05:54.670 that
00:05:54.880 also

00:05:55.030 will
00:05:55.300 stop
00:05:55.510 the
00:05:55.630 fermentation
00:05:55.840 process

00:05:56.760 juster

00:05:58.360 stir
00:05:58.570 that
00:05:58.840 is
00:05:58.990 the

00:05:59.110 question
00:05:59.560 some
00:06:00.130 people
00:06:00.400 believe
00:06:00.700 stirring

00:06:01.240 the

00:06:04.750 down
00:06:04.990 some
00:06:05.560 people
00:06:05.830 believe
00:06:06.070 you

00:06:06.100 should
00:06:06.310 just
00:06:06.640 let

00:06:11.770 it
00:06:12.550 looks
00:06:12.580 like
00:06:12.910 it
00:06:13.270 needs
00:06:13.750 a
00:06:13.870 little
00:06:14.080 stir

00:06:14.290 I'll
