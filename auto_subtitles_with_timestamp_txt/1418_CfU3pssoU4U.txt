00:04:52.310 how
00:04:53.000 long
00:04:53.030 it

00:04:53.300 took
00:04:53.530 it
00:04:54.530 depends
00:04:54.889 on
00:04:54.949 people's
00:04:55.310 ovens
00:04:55.760 and

00:04:56.110 how

00:05:03.099 that

00:05:04.099 the

00:05:05.539 crispy

00:05:07.300 you

00:05:56.710 I
00:05:57.040 just
00:05:57.699 check
00:05:57.910 when
00:05:58.060 they
00:05:58.120 start

00:05:58.630 a

00:05:58.690 little
00:05:58.900 bit
00:06:01.530 you
00:06:02.530 can
00:06:02.740 do
00:06:02.830 a
00:06:02.860 taste
00:06:03.100 test

00:06:03.639 want
00:06:03.900 and
00:06:04.900 one
00:06:05.050 of
00:06:05.139 the
00:06:05.229 small
00:06:05.500 ones
00:06:09.930 it's

00:06:10.930 a
00:06:10.990 really
00:06:11.200 good
00:06:11.290 plane
00:06:11.669 you
00:06:12.669 can
00:06:12.790 taste
00:06:12.970 the

00:06:13.090 the
00:06:14.020 onion
00:06:15.000 and
00:06:16.000 the
00:06:16.120 coating
00:06:16.710 but
00:06:18.360 you
00:06:19.360 can

00:06:19.479 also
00:06:19.600 have
00:06:19.840 ketchup
00:06:20.050 you
00:06:20.260 can
00:06:20.380 make
00:06:20.470 your
00:06:20.620 own

00:06:20.680 you
00:06:20.889 can
00:06:21.040 buy
00:06:21.389 various
00:06:22.389 ketchups
00:06:22.870 and
00:06:23.760 or

00:06:24.760 whatever
00:06:25.500 sauces
00:06:26.500 you
00:06:26.620 like
00:06:26.800 some
00:06:27.610 people
00:06:27.820 use

00:06:27.970 a
00:06:28.000 ranch
00:06:28.270 dip
00:06:28.539 or
00:06:30.030 barbecue
00:06:31.030 sauce
00:06:31.210 or

00:06:31.449 something
00:06:31.600 like
00:06:31.780 that
00:06:31.979 but
00:06:32.979 I
00:06:33.810 like
00:06:34.810 to
00:06:34.990 try
00:06:35.139 I

00:06:35.169 like
00:06:35.440 to
00:06:35.530 use
00:06:35.650 ketchup
00:06:37.380 so
00:06:38.380 I
00:06:38.410 just
00:06:38.590 thought

00:06:38.710 I'd
00:06:38.830 show
00:06:38.979 you
00:06:39.010 this
00:06:39.160 yeah
00:06:39.340 and
00:06:39.760 so
00:06:40.720 the

00:06:40.840 general
00:06:41.110 idea
00:06:41.500 is
00:06:41.560 to
00:06:41.830 you
00:06:42.789 can
00:06:42.940 coat
00:06:43.120 a
00:06:43.150 lot
00:06:43.330 of

00:06:43.479 things
00:06:43.690 you
00:06:44.169 can
00:06:44.350 do

00:06:45.389 zucchini
00:06:47.970 you
00:06:48.970 can
00:06:49.090 even
00:06:49.210 do
00:06:49.330 potatoes
00:06:49.599 but
00:06:50.050 so

00:06:50.650 basically
00:06:51.010 you're
00:06:51.220 coating
00:06:51.490 it
00:06:51.580 with
00:06:51.610 the

00:06:52.270 flour
00:06:52.479 water
00:06:53.020 mixture
00:06:53.620 and
00:06:53.740 then
00:06:53.830 you're

00:06:54.010 putting
00:06:54.789 bread
00:06:55.389 crumbs
00:06:55.630 on
00:06:55.780 top
00:06:55.810 and
00:06:56.289 there's

00:06:56.440 other
00:06:56.590 ways
00:06:56.770 to
00:06:56.979 do
00:06:57.099 it

00:06:57.250 gluten
00:06:57.880 free
00:06:57.910 there's
00:06:58.330 other
00:06:58.450 flours
00:06:58.960 quinoa

00:06:59.760 chickpea
00:07:00.760 flour
00:07:01.590 you
00:07:02.590 can
00:07:02.650 coat
00:07:02.979 it
00:07:03.130 in

00:07:04.200 various
00:07:05.200 things
00:07:05.370 corn
00:07:06.370 flakes

00:07:10.089 some
00:07:11.089 gluten-free
00:07:11.559 breads
00:07:12.559 and
00:07:12.889 stuff
00:07:13.099 like

00:07:15.729 so
00:07:16.729 yeah
00:07:17.509 hope
00:07:17.779 you
00:07:17.839 guys
00:07:17.929 like
00:07:18.229 this
00:07:18.439 very

00:07:19.309 similar
00:07:19.639 to
00:07:19.729 the
00:07:19.789 cauliflower
00:07:20.209 wing
00:07:20.539 recipe

00:07:21.109 and
00:07:21.789 feel
00:07:22.789 free
00:07:22.999 to
00:07:23.029 bread
00:07:23.389 lots
00:07:24.169 of
00:07:24.349 other

00:07:24.499 things
00:07:24.769 that
00:07:24.889 can
00:07:25.099 make
00:07:25.509 veggies
00:07:26.509 nice
00:07:26.659 and

00:07:26.899 crispy
00:07:27.849 I've
00:07:28.849 seen
00:07:28.999 people
00:07:29.269 do
00:07:29.359 Albanians
00:07:30.019 as

00:07:30.169 well
00:07:30.759 if
00:07:31.759 you
00:07:31.909 like
00:07:32.059 a
00:07:32.089 lot
00:07:32.299 you
00:07:32.689 know
00:07:32.869 jalapeno

00:07:33.469 popper
00:07:33.859 type
00:07:34.129 thing
00:07:34.339 so
00:07:35.149 the
00:07:35.269 crisp
00:07:35.479 the

00:07:35.719 branding
00:07:36.259 just
00:07:36.469 gives
00:07:36.619 it
00:07:36.679 a
00:07:37.269 crispy
00:07:38.269 texture

00:07:38.739 and
00:07:39.739 the
00:07:40.369 baking
00:07:40.699 is
00:07:40.819 so
00:07:40.939 much
00:07:41.119 healthier
00:07:41.329 than

00:07:41.509 the
00:07:41.719 typical
00:07:42.639 french
00:07:43.639 fries
00:07:43.849 and
00:07:44.059 onions
00:07:44.329 that

00:07:44.419 are
00:07:44.559 deep
00:07:45.559 fried
00:07:45.859 in
00:07:46.369 oil
00:07:46.489 so
00:07:47.109 hope
00:07:48.109 you
00:07:48.199 guys

00:07:48.259 like
00:07:48.529 that
00:07:48.559 one
00:07:48.739 to
00:07:48.979 talk
