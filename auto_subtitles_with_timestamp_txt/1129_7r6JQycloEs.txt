00:00:16.500 like
00:00:16.650 it
00:00:16.770 would

00:00:16.859 be
00:00:16.980 hard
00:00:17.160 to
00:00:17.190 grow
00:00:17.400 but
00:00:17.580 it's
00:00:17.699 actually
00:00:18.090 really

00:00:18.240 easy
00:00:18.350 and
00:00:19.350 if
00:00:19.560 I
00:00:19.680 recall
00:00:19.980 it's
00:00:20.250 not
00:00:20.369 that
00:00:20.490 hard

00:00:20.609 to
00:00:20.640 cook
00:00:20.850 no
00:00:21.330 it
00:00:21.600 cooks
00:00:21.990 up
00:00:22.109 super
00:00:22.439 fast

00:00:22.859 and

00:00:24.630 soup
00:00:24.930 push
00:00:24.960 bok
00:00:25.380 choy
00:00:25.560 it
00:00:25.859 only
00:00:25.980 takes

00:00:26.220 about
00:00:26.310 15
00:00:26.760 minutes

00:00:36.559 I'm
00:00:37.559 gonna
00:00:37.770 plant
00:00:38.040 some
00:00:38.390 bok
00:00:39.390 choy
00:00:39.600 by
00:00:39.809 seed

00:00:40.110 you
00:00:40.320 can
00:00:40.470 also
00:00:40.650 grow
00:00:40.950 them
00:00:41.130 by
00:00:41.280 starts
00:00:41.670 but

00:00:41.940 seeds
00:00:42.210 are
00:00:42.329 less
00:00:42.480 expensive
00:00:43.079 and
00:00:43.260 it
00:00:43.860 grows

00:00:44.070 really
00:00:44.280 well
00:00:44.520 and
00:00:44.730 quickly
00:00:44.970 from
00:00:45.360 seed
00:00:46.460 when

00:00:47.460 you're
00:00:47.610 working
00:00:48.090 with
00:00:48.239 small
00:00:48.390 seeds
00:00:48.860 not
00:00:49.860 only

00:00:50.100 do
00:00:50.280 you
00:00:50.400 want
00:00:50.640 to
00:00:50.820 have
00:00:51.030 soil
00:00:51.900 that's
00:00:52.430 finally

00:00:53.430 worked
00:00:53.699 but
00:00:54.120 you
00:00:54.180 also
00:00:54.830 want
00:00:55.830 to
00:00:56.160 make
00:00:56.910 sure

00:00:57.059 that
00:00:57.180 you're
00:00:57.330 not
00:00:57.420 going
00:00:57.600 to
00:00:57.660 cover
00:00:57.839 them
00:00:58.050 up

00:00:58.230 too
00:00:58.530 much
00:00:59.239 with
00:01:00.239 soil
00:01:00.510 and
00:01:00.809 then
00:01:00.900 I'm
00:01:01.470 gonna

00:01:01.589 take
00:01:01.800 a
00:01:01.860 pinch
00:01:02.220 of
00:01:02.339 the
00:01:02.460 seed
00:01:02.730 and
00:01:03.180 just
00:01:03.920 try

00:01:04.920 and
00:01:05.129 sew
00:01:05.430 it
00:01:05.580 in
00:01:05.729 a
00:01:05.820 row
00:01:06.060 spacing
00:01:06.750 the
00:01:06.869 seeds
00:01:07.110 as

00:01:07.470 evenly
00:01:08.250 as
00:01:08.369 I
00:01:08.700 can

00:01:09.440 you
00:01:10.440 know
00:01:10.590 aiming
00:01:11.070 for
00:01:11.220 about
00:01:11.430 an
00:01:11.640 inch
00:01:11.820 apart

00:01:13.310 it's
00:01:14.310 a
00:01:14.369 good
00:01:14.520 idea
00:01:14.789 with
00:01:15.030 really
00:01:15.300 small
00:01:15.539 seed

00:01:15.750 and
00:01:15.990 this
00:01:16.080 works
00:01:16.289 well
00:01:16.500 with
00:01:16.619 basil
00:01:17.009 seed

00:01:17.479 carrot
00:01:18.479 seed
00:01:18.720 and
00:01:18.960 you
00:01:19.020 see
00:01:19.140 that
00:01:19.289 small
00:01:19.729 water

00:01:20.729 it
00:01:21.060 in
00:01:21.960 with
00:01:22.289 a
00:01:22.500 stream
00:01:22.890 from
00:01:23.039 a
00:01:23.190 watering
00:01:23.610 can

00:01:23.640 not
00:01:24.030 from
00:01:24.300 your
00:01:24.479 hose
00:01:24.690 hoses
00:01:25.649 have
00:01:25.800 too
00:01:26.190 strong

00:01:26.850 of
00:01:27.000 a
00:01:27.090 stream
00:01:27.330 of
00:01:27.479 water
00:01:27.690 and
00:01:28.110 they'll
00:01:28.440 wash

00:01:28.710 your
00:01:28.979 seeds
00:01:29.220 away
00:01:29.420 now
00:01:30.420 you
00:01:30.479 can
00:01:30.929 cover
00:01:31.200 them

00:01:31.410 up
00:01:31.500 with
00:01:31.560 garden
00:01:32.009 soil
00:01:32.220 but
00:01:32.820 I
00:01:32.850 like
00:01:33.210 to
00:01:33.390 use

00:01:33.420 some
00:01:33.750 potting
00:01:34.110 soil
00:01:34.350 because
00:01:35.310 it's

00:01:35.550 lightweight
00:01:35.850 I
00:01:36.509 know
00:01:36.990 that
00:01:37.259 it's
00:01:37.380 weed
00:01:37.649 free

00:01:38.039 and
00:01:38.310 it's
00:01:38.880 a
00:01:39.000 slightly
00:01:39.210 different
00:01:39.780 color
00:01:39.990 from

00:01:40.200 my
00:01:40.380 garden
00:01:40.560 soil
00:01:40.950 so
00:01:41.490 it
00:01:41.640 makes
00:01:41.819 it
00:01:41.940 easy
00:01:42.270 for

00:01:42.390 me
00:01:42.690 to
00:01:42.720 remember
00:01:43.459 where
00:01:44.459 I've
00:01:44.789 sown
00:01:45.240 seed
00:01:45.959 then

00:01:46.590 I
00:01:46.649 go
00:01:46.830 through
00:01:47.099 and
00:01:47.310 tap
00:01:47.789 the
00:01:48.149 soil
00:01:48.390 with
00:01:48.599 my

00:01:48.750 hand
00:01:49.050 and
00:01:50.869 that's
00:01:51.869 just
00:01:52.110 so
00:01:52.200 there's
00:01:52.380 good

00:01:52.560 soil
00:01:52.860 to
00:01:53.039 seed
00:01:53.220 contact
00:01:53.759 which
00:01:54.000 is
00:01:54.030 important

00:01:54.539 for
00:01:54.569 germination
00:01:55.020 and
00:01:55.440 then
00:01:56.429 you
00:01:57.239 go
00:01:57.360 back

00:01:57.690 over
00:01:58.170 with
00:01:59.009 the
00:01:59.069 water
00:01:59.429 one
00:01:59.700 more
00:01:59.910 time
00:02:00.259 just

00:02:01.259 to
00:02:01.349 make
00:02:01.410 sure
00:02:01.679 that
00:02:01.950 it's
00:02:02.099 all
00:02:02.220 watered
00:02:02.550 in
00:02:02.670 so

00:02:03.539 I
00:02:03.569 have
00:02:03.929 some
00:02:04.110 pocket
