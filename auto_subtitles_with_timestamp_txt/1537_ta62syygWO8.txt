00:00:54.690 first
00:00:54.960 thing
00:00:55.170 that

00:00:55.350 goes

00:01:02.850 the

00:01:03.539 next
00:01:03.719 thing
00:01:03.989 that
00:01:04.019 goes
00:01:04.170 in
00:01:04.500 is
00:01:04.710 the
00:01:05.070 bread

00:01:05.790 cubes
00:01:06.030 you

00:01:08.850 very

00:01:09.180 very
00:01:09.390 low
00:01:09.720 flame
00:01:10.020 but
00:01:10.530 the
00:01:10.650 idea
00:01:11.010 is
00:01:11.160 to
00:01:11.310 make

00:01:11.460 sure
00:01:11.670 it

00:01:12.930 well
00:01:13.440 you
00:01:13.560 can

00:01:13.680 also
00:01:13.830 use
00:01:14.130 a
00:01:14.160 mixture
00:01:14.520 of
00:01:14.820 butter
00:01:15.150 and
00:01:15.450 oil
00:01:15.630 but

00:01:16.530 I
00:01:16.560 love
00:01:16.890 the
00:01:17.070 taste
00:01:17.220 of
00:01:17.430 olive
00:01:17.550 oil
00:01:17.760 so
00:01:18.120 trust

00:01:18.420 me
00:01:18.540 when
00:01:18.930 it
00:01:19.050 comes
00:01:19.140 to
00:01:19.320 this

00:01:34.350 of
00:01:34.439 black
00:01:34.649 pepper
00:01:34.710 so
00:01:35.670 I'm

00:02:06.630 is
00:02:06.810 made
00:02:07.290 of
00:02:07.409 soya
00:02:07.710 next

00:02:15.690 finely
00:02:16.470 minced
00:02:16.860 garlic
00:02:17.810 the
00:02:18.810 next
00:02:19.170 that
00:02:19.290 goes

00:02:19.470 in
00:02:19.680 is

00:02:28.300 tablespoon
00:02:29.080 of
00:02:29.110 chilled

00:02:29.620 water
00:02:29.910 what
00:02:30.910 is
00:02:31.060 very
00:02:31.300 important
00:02:31.750 in
00:02:31.840 this

00:02:31.959 recipe
00:02:32.319 because
00:02:32.980 that
00:02:33.280 is
00:02:33.400 actually
00:02:33.819 want
00:02:33.970 to

00:02:34.000 make
00:02:34.180 it
00:02:34.360 like
00:02:34.569 a
00:02:34.600 thin
00:02:35.080 flowy
00:02:35.560 dressing

00:02:36.100 otherwise
00:02:36.730 this
00:02:37.000 is
00:02:37.060 a
00:02:37.209 dressing
00:02:37.630 made
00:02:37.780 of

00:02:37.900 mayonnaise
00:02:38.319 which
00:02:38.709 tends
00:02:39.010 to
00:02:39.190 become
00:02:39.310 a

00:02:39.430 little
00:02:39.730 thick
00:02:39.970 and
00:02:40.090 cloggy
00:02:40.600 water
00:02:41.290 will
00:02:41.500 just

00:02:41.709 make
00:02:41.950 it
00:02:41.980 nice
00:02:42.280 and
00:02:42.670 flowy
00:02:43.000 so
00:02:43.720 there
00:02:43.900 I
00:02:43.930 go
00:02:44.020 a

00:02:44.380 quick
00:02:44.739 mix
00:02:45.780 there
00:02:46.780 you
00:02:46.870 have
00:02:47.050 this
00:02:47.500 beautiful

00:02:48.239 Caesar
00:02:49.239 dressing
00:02:50.069 absolutely
00:02:51.069 done
00:02:51.220 and

00:02:51.370 ready
00:02:51.489 make
00:02:52.270 sure
00:02:52.510 when
00:02:52.900 you're
00:02:52.989 adding
00:02:53.080 salt

00:02:53.470 in
00:02:53.620 this
00:02:53.709 recipe
00:02:53.850 it's
00:02:54.850 to
00:02:55.090 its
00:02:55.239 absolute

00:02:55.450 minimum
00:02:56.380 and
00:02:56.560 required
00:02:57.010 quantity
00:02:57.459 because

00:02:58.090 parmesan
00:02:58.660 also
00:02:59.320 has
00:02:59.470 solved
00:02:59.830 so
00:03:00.010 remember

00:03:00.340 that
00:03:00.570 now
00:03:01.570 that
00:03:01.720 the
00:03:01.840 Caesar
00:03:02.080 dressing
00:03:02.230 is

00:03:02.709 ready
00:03:02.850 that's
00:03:03.850 how
00:03:04.030 the
00:03:04.090 consistency
00:03:04.930 should

00:03:04.959 be
00:03:05.230 nice
00:03:06.070 light
00:03:06.580 flowy
00:03:07.090 yet
00:03:07.390 a
00:03:08.080 little
00:03:08.410 thick

00:03:08.940 but
00:03:09.940 not
00:03:09.970 very
00:03:10.390 runny
00:03:10.600 make
00:03:11.080 sure
00:03:11.319 so
00:03:12.220 there

00:03:12.400 you
00:03:12.519 go
00:03:12.959 let's
00:03:13.959 start
00:03:14.080 prepping
00:03:14.650 the
00:03:14.860 lettuce

00:03:15.160 leaves

00:03:16.120 I
00:03:16.180 have
00:03:16.390 some
00:03:17.230 cost
