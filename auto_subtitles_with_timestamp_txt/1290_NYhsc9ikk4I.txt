00:02:55.019 dry
00:02:55.290 in
00:02:55.500 the

00:02:55.590 refrigerator
00:02:56.160 for
00:02:56.250 a
00:02:56.459 day
00:02:56.489 that's
00:02:57.269 going
00:02:57.510 to

00:02:57.569 help
00:02:57.690 keep
00:02:57.810 the
00:02:57.959 skin
00:02:58.319 very
00:02:58.769 very
00:02:59.069 crispy

00:02:59.519 we're
00:03:00.030 going
00:03:00.150 to
00:03:00.209 set
00:03:00.420 him
00:03:00.480 out
00:03:00.630 on
00:03:00.780 a
00:03:00.810 tray
00:03:01.140 put

00:03:01.799 in
00:03:01.889 the
00:03:01.950 fridge
00:03:02.160 and
00:03:02.430 let
00:03:02.489 them
00:03:02.670 dry

00:03:02.880 overnight
00:03:03.209 well
00:03:03.900 as
00:03:03.989 you
00:03:04.079 can
00:03:04.200 see
00:03:04.260 the
00:03:05.060 wings

00:03:06.060 have
00:03:06.269 been
00:03:06.389 drying
00:03:06.660 overnight
00:03:07.019 they've
00:03:07.440 got
00:03:07.560 a

00:03:07.590 nice
00:03:07.739 dry
00:03:08.069 texture
00:03:08.670 the
00:03:08.819 skin
00:03:09.030 is
00:03:09.150 dried
00:03:09.389 out
00:03:09.569 a

00:03:09.600 lot
00:03:09.900 we
00:03:10.829 rubbed
00:03:11.069 them
00:03:11.220 with
00:03:11.250 the
00:03:11.519 seasonings

00:03:12.030 and
00:03:12.209 the
00:03:12.299 baking
00:03:12.630 powder
00:03:12.870 to
00:03:13.079 make
00:03:13.200 them
00:03:13.380 get

00:03:13.560 crispy
00:03:13.920 at
00:03:14.040 least
00:03:14.250 in
00:03:14.430 theory
00:03:14.700 and
00:03:15.120 now
00:03:15.389 we're

00:03:15.510 going
00:03:15.600 to
00:03:15.660 put
00:03:15.810 them
00:03:15.870 in
00:03:15.989 a
00:03:16.049 400
00:03:16.530 degree
00:03:16.560 oven

00:03:17.220 total
00:03:17.850 cooking
00:03:18.060 time
00:03:18.209 is
00:03:18.569 going
00:03:18.690 to
00:03:18.750 be

00:03:18.900 probably
00:03:19.200 about
00:03:19.500 45
00:03:20.130 minutes
00:03:20.400 but
00:03:20.700 I'm
00:03:21.150 going

00:03:21.299 to
00:03:21.329 check
00:03:21.540 them
00:03:21.690 after
00:03:22.019 about
00:03:22.049 20
00:03:22.530 25
00:03:22.859 minutes

00:03:23.040 and
00:03:23.579 flip
00:03:23.790 them
00:03:23.910 over
00:03:24.060 the
00:03:24.690 other
00:03:24.720 thing
00:03:25.109 to

00:03:25.260 know
00:03:25.380 is
00:03:25.560 that
00:03:25.590 I
00:03:25.739 put
00:03:26.040 the
00:03:26.220 oven
00:03:26.519 rack
00:03:26.700 all
00:03:27.000 the

00:03:27.269 way
00:03:27.389 up
00:03:27.600 as
00:03:27.840 high
00:03:28.019 as
00:03:28.049 it
00:03:28.260 will
00:03:28.410 go
00:03:28.470 so
00:03:29.340 that
00:03:29.459 I

00:03:29.489 can
00:03:29.670 get
00:03:29.790 a
00:03:29.819 lot
00:03:30.030 of
00:03:30.060 radiated
00:03:30.720 heat
00:03:30.780 from
00:03:31.079 the

00:03:31.200 top
00:03:31.410 of
00:03:31.620 the
00:03:31.739 oven
00:03:32.040 so
00:03:32.190 it's
00:03:32.340 almost
00:03:32.670 more
00:03:32.880 like

00:03:32.910 a
00:03:33.090 broiler
00:03:33.660 we'll
00:03:34.079 see
00:03:34.260 if
00:03:34.350 that
00:03:34.380 works
00:03:34.739 so
00:03:34.980 now

00:03:35.130 into
00:03:35.730 the
00:03:35.819 oven
00:03:36.120 for
00:03:36.299 the
00:03:36.329 first
00:03:36.569 25
00:03:37.019 minutes

00:03:38.840 I've
00:03:39.840 got
00:03:40.049 these
00:03:40.170 out
00:03:40.349 of
00:03:40.470 the
00:03:40.560 oven
00:03:40.739 now
00:03:40.980 and

00:03:41.190 they're
00:03:41.280 actually
00:03:41.459 turning
00:03:41.940 a
00:03:42.120 rather
00:03:42.329 nice

00:03:42.630 color
00:03:42.989 I'm
00:03:43.650 going
00:03:43.799 to
00:03:43.889 flip
00:03:44.099 them
00:03:44.310 all
00:03:44.519 over
00:03:44.549 so

00:03:45.359 they
00:03:45.480 get
00:03:45.630 a
00:03:45.690 chance
00:03:45.780 to
00:03:46.170 sort
00:03:47.130 of
00:03:47.250 base

00:03:47.549 themselves
00:03:47.880 with
00:03:48.569 whatever
00:03:48.900 fat
00:03:49.170 they
00:03:49.410 have

00:03:49.560 under
00:03:49.859 the
00:03:49.980 skin
00:03:50.250 that's
00:03:50.400 rendering
00:03:50.849 out
00:03:50.970 now

00:03:51.209 these
00:03:51.840 may
00:03:52.139 stick
00:03:52.500 a
00:03:52.530 little
00:03:52.769 bit
00:03:52.889 just
00:03:53.370 move

00:03:53.849 them
00:03:54.030 a
00:03:54.120 little
00:03:54.150 bit
00:03:54.630 on
00:03:54.840 the
00:03:55.560 rack
00:03:55.799 and
00:03:56.160 they

00:03:56.489 should
00:03:56.910 come
00:03:57.299 off
00:03:57.510 fairly
00:03:58.169 easy
00:03:58.849 well
00:03:59.849 I
00:03:59.880 will

00:04:00.120 say
00:04:00.329 they
00:04:00.450 look
00:04:00.660 pretty
00:04:00.930 good
00:04:01.049 and
00:04:01.349 they're

00:04:01.440 smelling
00:04:01.859 really
00:04:02.430 really
00:04:02.669 good
00:04:02.849 but
00:04:03.180 now
00:04:03.329 back

00:04:03.690 into
00:04:03.900 the
00:04:03.959 oven
00:04:04.109 for
00:04:04.380 another
00:04:04.440 20
00:04:04.859 25
00:04:04.980 minutes

00:04:05.549 well
00:04:06.209 it's
00:04:06.390 been
00:04:06.510 about
00:04:06.599 25
00:04:07.079 extra
00:04:07.560 minutes

00:04:09.430 say
00:04:09.689 these
00:04:10.689 things
00:04:10.959 look
00:04:11.319 really
00:04:11.769 really
00:04:12.459 good

00:04:12.849 they're
00:04:13.420 not
00:04:13.500 tremendously
00:04:14.500 dark
00:04:14.980 in
00:04:15.189 color

00:04:15.430 but
00:04:15.670 they
00:04:15.819 do
00:04:15.879 have
00:04:16.359 a
00:04:16.389 very
00:04:16.750 firm
00:04:17.229 crispy

00:04:18.190 feeling
00:04:18.609 skin
00:04:19.030 so
00:04:19.690 I
00:04:19.720 think
00:04:20.109 we
00:04:20.259 may
00:04:20.410 have

00:04:20.440 accomplished
00:04:21.009 our
00:04:21.130 goal
00:04:21.370 of
00:04:21.549 getting
00:04:21.669 crispy

00:04:22.210 wings
00:04:22.479 out
00:04:23.050 of
00:04:23.320 the
00:04:23.440 oven
00:04:23.590 instead
00:04:23.949 of

00:04:24.130 deep-frying
00:04:24.639 them
00:04:24.880 I
00:04:25.120 have
00:04:26.020 here
00:04:27.660 the
00:04:28.660 most

00:04:28.960 typical
00:04:29.440 brand
00:04:29.710 of
00:04:30.009 hot
00:04:30.310 sauce
00:04:30.550 that's
00:04:30.910 used

00:04:31.120 for
00:04:31.210 these
00:04:31.419 wings
00:04:31.720 it's
00:04:31.960 probably
00:04:32.500 the
00:04:32.620 most

00:04:32.770 authentic
00:04:33.190 and
00:04:33.550 I
00:04:33.880 have
00:04:34.060 a
00:04:34.090 bat
