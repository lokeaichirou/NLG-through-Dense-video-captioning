00:04:40.400 stovetop
00:04:40.720 getting
00:04:41.720 hot
00:04:41.900 because
00:04:42.230 it
00:04:42.410 gets
00:04:43.070 too

00:04:43.220 hot
00:04:43.370 and
00:04:43.490 it
00:04:43.580 burns
00:04:43.760 and

00:04:45.500 and

00:04:45.740 it's
00:04:45.860 messy
00:04:46.280 so
00:04:46.610 don't
00:04:47.120 let
00:04:47.240 that
00:04:47.330 get
00:04:47.480 too
00:04:47.630 hot

00:04:47.780 before

00:04:48.380 your
00:04:48.670 onions
00:04:49.670 on

00:04:50.270 gonna
00:04:50.390 put
00:04:50.570 your
00:04:50.690 onions
00:04:50.810 on
00:04:51.790 normally
00:04:52.790 you

00:04:52.880 let
00:04:53.060 them
00:04:53.180 saute
00:04:53.480 it
00:04:53.750 for
00:04:53.780 a
00:04:53.930 little
00:04:54.050 bit
00:04:54.170 maybe

00:04:54.770 about
00:04:54.860 two
00:04:55.220 minutes
00:04:55.400 and
00:04:56.140 and
00:04:57.140 just
00:04:57.800 so
00:04:57.920 you

00:04:58.010 know
00:04:58.070 it's
00:04:58.310 okay
00:04:58.670 to
00:04:58.730 add
00:04:58.910 everything
00:04:59.180 at
00:04:59.420 once

00:04:59.570 and
00:04:59.750 then
00:05:00.020 start
00:05:00.350 it
00:05:00.470 like
00:05:00.590 it
00:05:00.770 doesn't
00:05:01.070 matter

00:05:01.220 how
00:05:01.430 you
00:05:01.460 do
00:05:01.700 it
00:05:01.850 this
00:05:02.240 is
00:05:02.420 just
00:05:02.450 the
00:05:02.780 order

00:05:03.230 that
00:05:03.350 I

00:05:03.590 do
00:05:03.890 it
00:05:04.010 in
00:05:04.130 so
00:05:04.430 you
00:05:04.490 can
00:05:04.790 just

00:05:04.940 however
00:05:05.540 works
00:05:06.170 for

00:07:17.270 if
00:07:17.570 someone

00:07:17.840 doesn't
00:07:17.990 say
00:07:18.350 that
00:07:18.590 then
00:07:18.800 I

00:07:19.430 with
00:07:19.910 the
00:07:20.030 water

00:07:24.680 your
00:07:24.800 potatoes

00:07:24.920 and
00:07:25.520 then
00:07:25.670 the
00:07:26.270 beans
00:07:26.540 I
00:07:26.930 ended
00:07:27.170 up
00:07:27.230 having
00:07:27.470 to

00:07:27.650 add
00:07:27.830 a
00:07:27.860 little
00:07:28.070 bit
00:07:28.190 more
00:07:28.310 water
00:07:28.640 while

00:07:29.120 was

00:07:29.240 cooking
00:07:29.390 them
00:07:29.750 so
00:07:30.320 just
00:07:30.920 keep
00:07:31.040 that
00:07:31.160 in
00:07:31.220 mind

00:07:31.340 depending
00:07:31.610 on
00:07:32.090 this
00:07:32.600 is
00:07:32.720 really
00:07:33.140 weird
00:07:33.590 I

00:07:33.860 didn't
00:07:34.070 know
00:07:34.130 about
00:07:34.340 cooking
00:07:34.460 but
00:07:34.790 depending

00:07:35.300 on
00:07:35.420 your
00:07:35.540 elevation
00:07:35.750 oh
00:07:36.320 you
00:07:37.250 need
00:07:37.580 to
00:07:37.730 add

00:07:37.850 more
00:07:38.060 water
00:07:38.120 cuz
00:07:38.510 it's
00:07:38.660 we're
00:07:38.840 in
00:07:39.080 a
00:07:39.200 dry

00:07:39.560 climate
00:07:40.130 and
00:07:40.280 we're
00:07:40.520 up
00:07:40.610 higher
00:07:40.820 up
00:07:40.850 the
00:07:41.690 so
00:07:42.380 it

00:07:42.500 sucks
00:07:42.770 the
00:07:43.040 water
00:07:43.670 out
00:07:43.970 quicker
00:07:44.420 so
00:07:45.050 I
00:07:45.080 had
