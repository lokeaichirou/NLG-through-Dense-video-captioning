00:02:45.760 super
00:02:46.150 super
00:02:46.300 important
00:02:46.840 like
00:02:47.020 if
00:02:47.140 you've

00:02:47.290 ever

00:02:48.580 no
00:02:48.850 salt
00:02:49.240 in
00:02:49.390 the

00:02:49.930 it
00:02:50.170 tastes
00:02:50.410 bland
00:02:50.710 they
00:02:51.340 don't
00:02:51.550 have
00:02:51.700 very

00:02:51.850 much
00:02:52.000 flavor
00:02:52.300 to
00:02:52.420 them
00:02:52.750 same
00:02:53.080 thing
00:02:53.260 with

00:02:58.540 taste
00:02:58.930 like
00:02:59.170 nothing
00:02:59.410 so
00:02:59.920 it
00:03:00.130 makes
00:03:00.310 a
00:03:00.430 huge

00:05:13.740 for
00:05:14.130 me
00:05:14.280 I
00:05:14.490 used
00:05:14.940 about
00:05:15.060 3/4
00:05:15.690 of

00:05:16.740 milk
00:05:16.800 it's
00:05:17.400 creamy

00:05:18.420 I
00:05:18.450 can
00:05:18.840 smell
00:05:19.140 the
00:05:19.770 cheese
00:05:20.040 it's
00:05:20.820 going
00:05:21.000 to
00:05:21.060 be

00:05:21.120 divine
00:05:21.360 I'm
00:05:21.510 just
00:05:21.660 going
00:05:21.810 to
00:05:21.840 give
00:05:22.200 myself
00:05:22.320 a

00:05:22.560 little
00:05:22.590 taste
00:05:23.040 because
00:05:23.370 I
00:05:23.460 do
00:05:23.520 have
00:05:23.940 people

00:05:24.750 coming
00:05:25.020 over
00:05:25.290 for
00:05:25.470 dinner
00:05:25.530 but
00:05:26.070 I
00:05:26.720 hardly

00:05:27.720 could
00:05:27.990 resist
00:05:28.230 mashed
00:05:28.530 potatoes
00:05:28.890 ever
00:05:32.870 mmm

00:05:36.510 hot
00:05:37.100 but
00:05:38.100 there's
00:05:38.580 a
00:05:38.640 reason
00:05:39.030 why
00:05:39.150 this

00:05:39.210 is
00:05:39.510 my
00:05:39.630 husband

00:05:40.710 potato
00:05:41.060 and
00:05:42.060 I
00:05:42.150 think
