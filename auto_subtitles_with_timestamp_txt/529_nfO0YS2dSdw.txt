00:00:17.609 recipe
00:00:17.880 like

00:00:32.399 little
00:00:32.489 bit
00:00:32.820 of
00:00:32.850 olive
00:00:33.149 oil
00:00:33.210 in
00:00:33.420 there
00:00:33.570 we're

00:00:34.230 going

00:00:34.890 couple

00:00:35.160 strips
00:00:35.460 of
00:00:35.579 bacon
00:00:35.670 that

00:00:37.410 we're
00:00:37.530 pretty
00:00:37.649 much
00:00:37.770 going

00:00:38.070 cook
00:00:38.250 this
00:00:38.370 bacon
00:00:38.700 all
00:00:38.820 the
00:00:38.940 way
00:00:39.059 we
00:00:39.660 don't

00:00:39.840 necessarily
00:00:39.960 need
00:00:40.410 it
00:00:40.440 crispy
00:00:40.890 but
00:00:41.550 we
00:00:41.640 do

00:00:41.760 want
00:00:41.910 most
00:00:42.059 of
00:00:42.149 that
00:00:42.239 fat
00:00:42.420 rendered
00:00:42.809 out
00:00:42.930 and

00:00:43.649 for
00:00:43.800 some
00:00:44.010 fairly
00:00:44.250 significant

00:00:45.030 carmelization
00:00:45.600 to
00:00:45.809 happen
00:00:46.140 which
00:00:46.980 is
00:00:47.100 what
00:00:47.250 we

00:00:47.340 have
00:00:47.460 right
00:00:47.610 about
00:00:47.820 here
00:00:48.090 at
00:00:48.390 that
00:00:49.260 point

00:00:49.320 we're
00:00:49.559 going
00:00:49.649 to
00:00:49.710 throw
00:00:49.860 in
00:00:50.010 some
00:00:50.039 diced
00:00:50.370 onion

00:00:50.789 and
00:00:51.030 we'll
00:00:51.960 give
00:00:52.079 that
00:00:52.110 a
00:00:52.289 stir
00:00:52.469 and
00:00:52.860 we'll

00:00:53.010 saute
00:00:53.430 that
00:00:53.460 for
00:00:53.670 I
00:00:53.879 don't
00:00:54.090 know
00:00:54.149 three
00:00:54.390 or

00:00:54.420 four
00:00:54.539 minutes
00:00:54.930 maybe
00:00:55.140 five
00:00:55.610 until
00:00:56.610 those

00:00:56.699 onions
00:00:57.090 soften
00:00:57.300 and
00:00:57.660 kind
00:00:57.840 of
00:00:57.930 get
00:00:58.020 a
00:00:58.050 little

00:00:58.199 bit
00:00:58.410 golden
00:00:58.590 brown
00:00:58.949 and
00:00:59.609 by
00:00:59.730 the
00:00:59.789 way
00:00:59.940 don't

00:01:00.059 worry
00:01:00.180 about
00:01:00.420 throwing
00:01:00.660 in
00:01:00.780 a
00:01:00.840 pinch
00:01:01.050 of
00:01:01.140 salt

00:01:01.289 like
00:01:01.500 we
00:01:01.620 usually
00:01:01.739 do

00:01:02.340 we're
00:01:02.640 going
00:01:02.760 to
00:01:02.820 be
00:01:02.879 really
00:01:03.120 careful
00:01:03.270 with

00:01:03.570 salt
00:01:03.809 in
00:01:03.840 this
00:01:03.930 recipe
00:01:04.350 and
00:01:04.589 the
00:01:05.129 bacon
00:01:05.400 does

00:01:05.549 have
00:01:05.729 enough
00:01:05.909 salt
00:01:06.090 in
00:01:06.240 it
00:01:06.390 to
00:01:06.510 draw
00:01:06.689 a
00:01:06.720 little

00:01:06.900 bit
00:01:07.020 of
00:01:07.170 moisture
00:01:07.290 out
00:01:07.619 of
00:01:07.740 those
00:01:07.830 onions

00:01:08.250 which
00:01:08.880 should
00:01:09.060 be
00:01:09.150 enough
00:01:09.330 to
00:01:09.450 deglaze
00:01:09.659 that

00:01:09.960 bacon
00:01:10.290 goodness
00:01:10.590 from
00:01:10.770 the
00:01:10.860 bottom
00:01:11.130 of
00:01:11.220 the

00:01:11.280 pan
00:01:11.490 and
00:01:11.729 then
00:01:12.180 once
00:01:12.360 our
00:01:12.479 onions
00:01:12.750 look
00:01:12.930 good

00:01:13.110 we're
00:01:13.380 going
00:01:13.500 to
00:01:13.560 go
00:01:13.650 ahead
00:01:13.740 and
00:01:13.920 toss
00:01:14.070 in
00:01:14.220 a

00:01:14.280 little
00:01:14.310 bit
00:01:14.580 of
00:01:14.670 diced
00:01:14.820 celery
00:01:15.060 and
00:01:15.780 a
00:01:16.320 couple

00:01:16.530 cloves
00:01:16.650 of
00:01:17.070 minced
00:01:17.100 garlic
00:01:17.340 and
00:01:17.880 we'll
00:01:18.600 stir

00:01:18.810 that
00:01:18.960 in
00:01:19.170 and
00:01:19.200 we'll
00:01:19.439 just
00:01:19.470 cook
00:01:19.740 that
00:01:19.799 for

00:01:20.070 like
00:01:20.220 a
00:01:20.250 minute
00:01:20.700 as
00:01:21.240 usual
00:01:21.600 we
00:01:21.780 don't
00:01:21.960 want

00:01:22.080 that
00:01:22.200 garlic
00:01:22.530 to
00:01:22.619 brown
00:01:22.740 so
00:01:23.520 we'll
00:01:23.670 stir
00:01:23.790 that

00:01:23.939 in
00:01:24.119 and
00:01:24.150 saute
00:01:24.570 that
00:01:24.600 for
00:01:24.810 just
00:01:25.080 a
00:01:25.200 minute

00:01:25.680 at
00:01:25.950 which
00:01:26.100 point
00:01:26.130 we're
00:01:26.369 gonna
00:01:26.460 add
00:01:26.610 our

00:01:26.759 liquid
00:01:27.119 and
00:01:27.390 we're
00:01:27.540 going
00:01:27.659 to
00:01:27.689 use
00:01:27.810 two
00:01:27.990 kinds

00:01:28.170 well
00:01:28.829 actually
00:01:28.950 three
00:01:29.220 but
00:01:29.490 two
00:01:29.520 for
00:01:29.790 now
00:01:29.909 I'm

00:01:30.659 going
00:01:30.840 to
00:01:30.900 dump
00:01:31.079 in

00:01:33.240 of
00:01:33.329 chicken
00:01:33.570 broth
00:01:33.840 and

00:01:34.110 ideally
00:01:34.829 that's
00:01:34.950 unsalted
00:01:35.430 chicken
00:01:35.640 broth
00:01:36.060 or

00:01:36.450 low-sodium
00:01:36.960 because
00:01:37.590 I
00:01:37.680 mentioned
00:01:37.829 earlier

00:01:38.220 being
00:01:38.369 careful
00:01:38.759 about
00:01:38.880 the
00:01:39.060 salt
00:01:39.299 the
00:01:39.869 bacon

00:01:40.229 has
00:01:40.350 salt
00:01:40.680 clam
00:01:41.189 juice

00:01:41.909 kind
00:01:42.090 of

00:01:42.180 salty
00:01:42.540 but

00:01:44.970 up
00:01:45.090 to

00:01:45.210 medium-high

00:02:19.360 to
00:02:19.390 simmer
00:02:19.660 go
00:02:19.840 ahead

00:02:19.960 and
00:02:20.050 back
00:02:20.170 your
00:02:20.350 heat
00:02:20.500 down
00:02:20.620 to
00:02:20.680 maybe
00:02:21.010 medium

00:02:21.310 maybe
00:02:21.880 medium-low
00:02:22.570 we
00:02:23.290 just
00:02:23.500 want
00:02:23.620 to

00:02:23.680 maintain
00:02:23.800 a
00:02:23.980 nice
00:02:24.220 gentle
00:02:24.640 simmer
00:02:24.900 until

00:02:25.900 those

00:02:26.500 are
00:02:26.680 just
00:02:26.710 about
00:02:27.370 cooked
00:02:27.730 and

00:02:28.030 we
00:02:28.210 don't
00:02:28.390 need
00:02:28.480 them
00:02:28.600 falling
00:02:28.840 apart
00:02:29.140 at

00:02:30.100 right
00:02:30.190 they
00:02:30.310 still
00:02:30.370 can
00:02:30.610 be

00:02:30.700 little
00:02:30.970 firm
00:02:31.150 we

00:02:31.780 crunchy
00:02:32.020 and
00:02:32.380 by
00:02:32.770 the
00:02:32.830 way
00:02:32.980 because

00:02:33.760 that
00:02:33.940 rich

00:02:41.350 see
00:02:41.530 that
00:02:41.680 will
00:02:41.830 significantly

00:02:42.070 thicken
00:02:42.910 things
00:02:43.090 up
00:02:43.300 but
00:02:43.690 anyway

00:03:46.540 look
00:03:46.810 like

00:03:54.370 to
00:03:54.400 go

00:03:55.269 I

00:03:55.360 have
00:03:55.510 here

00:03:59.950 cook

00:04:00.160 and

00:04:33.520 sweet

00:04:33.879 herbaceous
00:04:34.389 flavor

00:04:35.229 important

00:04:38.740 as
00:04:38.830 that's

00:04:38.949 mixed
00:04:39.340 in
00:04:39.460 and
00:04:39.729 we've
00:04:40.120 tasted
00:04:40.360 for
00:04:40.659 final

00:04:40.990 seasoning

00:04:43.120 up

00:04:43.509 to
00:04:43.539 this
00:04:43.750 point
00:04:43.930 I
00:04:44.080 was
00:04:44.199 so
00:04:44.349 happy
00:04:44.530 it
00:04:44.830 was

00:04:45.400 smelling
00:04:45.909 amazing
00:04:46.000 it
00:04:46.720 was
00:04:46.930 tasting
00:04:47.379 amazing

00:04:47.550 but
00:04:48.550 as
00:04:48.639 soon
00:04:48.789 as
00:04:48.849 I
00:04:48.970 ladle
00:04:49.330 it
00:04:49.479 into
00:04:49.720 the
00:04:49.810 bowl

00:04:50.020 and

00:04:50.949 a
00:04:51.129 little
00:04:51.370 extra
00:04:51.580 tarragon

00:04:52.030 I
00:04:52.150 realized
00:04:52.569 I
00:04:52.870 didn't
00:04:53.259 like
00:04:53.379 how
00:04:53.470 this
00:04:53.650 looked

00:04:53.889 it
00:04:54.159 just
00:04:54.490 looked
00:04:54.699 kind
00:04:54.729 of
00:04:54.940 dingy
00:04:55.150 to
00:04:55.419 me
00:04:55.569 all

00:04:55.900 right
00:04:56.020 because
00:04:56.139 we
00:04:56.349 cook
00:04:56.500 that
00:04:56.530 bacon
00:04:56.949 and

00:04:57.069 onion
00:04:57.280 first
00:04:57.490 this
00:04:57.940 mixture
00:04:58.240 wasn't
00:04:58.569 even

00:04:58.720 close
00:04:58.900 to
00:04:59.110 your
00:04:59.229 more
00:04:59.379 traditional
00:04:59.500 white

00:05:00.069 chowder
00:05:00.370 colors
00:05:00.789 when
00:05:01.360 you
00:05:01.419 combine
00:05:01.780 that

00:05:01.810 with
00:05:02.020 a
00:05:02.199 green
00:05:02.500 from
00:05:02.680 the
00:05:02.740 celery
00:05:03.159 and
00:05:03.520 the

00:05:03.940 gold
00:05:04.180 from
00:05:04.300 the
00:05:04.389 potato
00:05:04.810 I
00:05:05.229 just
00:05:05.680 did
00:05:05.800 not
00:05:05.919 find

00:05:06.159 this
00:05:06.310 to
00:05:06.460 have
00:05:06.610 a
00:05:06.639 very
00:05:06.969 appetizing
00:05:07.360 color

00:05:07.800 although
00:05:08.800 a
00:05:08.830 few
00:05:09.039 people
00:05:09.250 that
00:05:09.400 saw
00:05:09.550 this
00:05:09.729 told

00:05:10.000 me
00:05:10.060 I
00:05:10.090 was
00:05:10.270 overreacting
00:05:10.509 that
00:05:11.050 it
00:05:11.169 didn't

00:05:11.409 look
00:05:11.500 that
00:05:11.560 bad
00:05:11.860 but
00:05:12.550 of
00:05:12.669 course
00:05:12.849 I
00:05:12.940 knew
00:05:13.090 them

00:05:13.300 and
00:05:13.780 when
00:05:13.900 it
00:05:13.990 comes
00:05:14.169 to
00:05:14.319 food
00:05:14.469 don't
00:05:14.770 believe

00:05:15.009 anything
00:05:15.310 friends
00:05:15.849 or
00:05:15.940 family
00:05:16.240 tell
00:05:16.389 you
00:05:16.539 but

00:05:16.990 anyway
00:05:17.229 above
00:05:17.469 and
00:05:17.590 beyond
00:05:17.800 it's

00:05:17.979 questionable
00:05:18.370 appearance
00:05:18.969 this
00:05:19.270 was

00:05:19.509 absolutely
00:05:20.229 delicious
00:05:21.159 those
00:05:21.550 bay
00:05:21.759 scallops

00:05:22.120 are
00:05:22.270 so
00:05:22.569 sweet
00:05:22.960 and
00:05:23.020 tender
00:05:23.349 especially
00:05:24.310 when

00:05:24.460 you
00:05:24.520 only
00:05:24.550 cook
00:05:24.909 them
00:05:25.030 briefly
00:05:25.300 I
00:05:25.599 forget

00:05:26.139 about
00:05:26.199 the
00:05:26.409 scallops
00:05:26.770 anytime

00:05:27.940 potatoes
00:05:28.330 that's
00:05:28.870 usually
00:05:29.229 a
00:05:29.289 good

00:05:29.319 experience
00:05:29.860 right
