00:05:39.860 open

00:05:40.190 the
00:05:40.280 lid
00:05:40.539 so
00:05:42.220 okay
00:05:43.220 now
00:05:43.430 look
00:05:43.820 at
00:05:43.970 this
00:05:44.120 meat

00:05:47.410 now
00:05:48.250 if
00:05:48.460 you
00:05:48.580 look
00:05:48.760 at
00:05:48.910 this
00:05:49.030 meat
00:05:49.330 it
00:05:49.990 is

00:05:50.140 coming
00:05:50.380 off
00:05:50.590 the
00:05:50.710 bone

00:05:51.160 that
00:05:51.550 means
00:05:51.820 this
00:05:52.090 meat
00:05:52.270 is
00:05:52.420 really
00:05:52.720 nicely

00:05:52.930 cooked
00:05:53.560 but
00:05:53.800 I
00:05:54.010 want
00:05:54.250 to
00:05:54.310 add
00:05:54.430 some
00:05:54.700 tomato

00:05:55.000 puree
00:05:55.150 so
00:05:55.870 what
00:05:56.080 I'm
00:05:56.170 going
00:05:56.380 to
00:05:56.440 do
00:05:56.590 first
00:05:57.160 I'm

00:05:57.700 going

00:05:58.090 remove
00:05:58.360 this
00:05:58.540 meat
00:05:58.810 so
00:05:59.320 this
00:05:59.590 is

00:05:59.740 another
00:06:00.010 reason
00:06:00.370 why
00:06:00.400 I
00:06:00.550 kept
00:06:00.910 this
00:06:01.060 meat
00:06:01.330 into

00:06:02.020 big
00:06:02.200 pieces
00:06:02.410 because
00:06:03.220 I
00:06:03.460 want
00:06:04.030 to
00:06:04.090 remove
00:06:04.390 this

00:06:04.600 big
00:06:05.560 pieces
00:06:05.950 out
00:06:06.100 easily
00:06:06.310 if
00:06:06.730 I
00:06:07.270 have
00:06:07.420 small

00:06:07.780 pieces
00:06:08.050 it
00:06:08.320 would
00:06:08.500 be
00:06:08.620 very
00:06:09.160 difficult
00:06:09.370 to

00:06:09.640 remove
00:06:09.880 them
00:06:10.030 okay
00:06:10.630 now
