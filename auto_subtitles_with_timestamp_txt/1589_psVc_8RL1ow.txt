00:01:23.250 bit

00:01:23.460 milder
00:01:23.729 if

00:01:24.660 have
00:01:24.869 this

00:01:33.929 little

00:01:34.080 milder
00:01:34.950 and
00:01:35.190 it
00:01:36.000 tastes
00:01:36.360 a
00:01:36.420 lot
00:01:36.509 better
00:01:36.570 so

00:01:37.380 that
00:01:37.649 is
00:01:37.800 what
00:01:38.009 we

00:01:38.369 the
00:01:38.460 sauce
00:01:38.670 and

00:01:39.330 it
00:01:39.840 should
00:01:40.020 come
00:01:40.170 out
00:01:40.319 like
00:01:40.440 this

00:01:43.440 the

00:01:43.560 first
00:01:43.770 thing
00:01:43.979 you
00:01:44.069 want
00:01:44.220 to
00:01:44.310 do
00:01:44.490 is
00:01:44.759 just
00:01:45.090 cook

00:01:45.330 your
00:01:45.539 chicken

00:02:01.240 now
00:02:02.240 I
00:02:02.300 initially
00:02:02.870 wanted
00:02:03.440 to
00:02:03.650 use
00:02:03.890 Forks
00:02:04.580 but

00:02:04.850 when
00:02:05.000 I
00:02:05.030 went
00:02:05.210 to
00:02:05.240 TMZ
00:02:05.720 to
00:02:05.840 have
00:02:06.200 any
00:02:06.410 of
00:02:06.560 the

00:02:06.850 life
00:02:07.850 stories
00:02:08.330 that
00:02:08.540 I

00:02:09.050 for

00:02:09.080 other
00:02:09.770 services
00:02:10.220 so
00:02:10.520 I
00:02:11.110 didn't
00:02:12.110 want
00:02:12.260 to
00:02:12.320 find

00:02:12.620 competent

00:02:32.630 the
00:02:32.720 other

00:02:32.810 vegetables
00:02:37.780 now
00:02:38.780 just
00:02:39.020 add
00:02:39.140 the
00:02:39.290 garlic

00:02:41.540 and
00:02:41.840 the
