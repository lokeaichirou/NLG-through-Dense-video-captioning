00:00:43.950 cloudy

00:00:44.280 that
00:00:44.550 water
00:00:44.820 is
00:00:45.059 that
00:00:45.480 starch
00:00:46.050 is
00:00:46.649 one
00:00:46.980 thing

00:00:47.190 that
00:00:47.219 will
00:00:47.460 prevent
00:00:47.910 a
00:00:48.270 nice
00:00:48.750 crusty

00:00:49.350 hashbrown
00:00:49.920 now
00:00:50.430 you
00:00:50.489 can
00:00:50.610 just
00:00:50.700 put
00:00:50.910 this
00:00:51.000 in
00:00:51.149 a

00:00:51.960 under
00:00:52.110 water
00:00:52.440 in
00:00:52.649 the

00:00:52.680 sink

00:00:53.460 can't
00:00:53.730 get
00:00:53.820 a
00:00:53.850 camera
00:00:54.120 in
00:00:54.239 my
00:00:54.300 sink

00:00:54.629 so
00:00:54.750 I
00:00:54.780 decided
00:00:55.140 to
00:00:55.230 do
00:00:55.350 it
00:00:55.469 in
00:00:55.530 a
00:00:55.590 bowl
00:00:55.800 so
00:00:56.550 I

00:00:56.579 actually
00:00:56.670 rinsed
00:00:57.149 this
00:00:57.300 twice
00:00:57.629 so
00:00:58.170 that
00:00:58.199 was

00:00:58.379 the
00:00:58.500 first
00:00:58.680 time
00:00:59.010 I
00:00:59.370 drained
00:00:59.940 it
00:01:00.170 added
00:01:01.170 more

00:01:01.350 cold
00:01:01.620 water

00:01:04.019 a

00:01:04.080 little
00:01:04.199 stir
00:01:04.530 poured
00:01:05.070 off
00:01:05.189 that
00:01:05.400 starchy

00:01:05.880 water
00:01:06.060 and
00:01:06.540 at
00:01:07.229 that
00:01:07.380 point
00:01:07.619 it
00:01:07.740 was
00:01:07.860 d

00:01:08.010 starched
00:01:08.369 enough
00:01:08.640 for
00:01:08.820 me
00:01:08.939 so
00:01:09.750 I
00:01:09.780 drained
00:01:10.170 it

00:01:10.350 you
00:01:10.950 want

00:01:13.229 drain
00:01:13.530 well

00:01:31.619 microwave

00:01:32.130 it
00:01:32.280 and
00:01:32.460 we
00:01:32.549 just
00:01:32.939 use
00:01:33.180 the
00:01:33.450 oily
00:01:33.990 part
00:01:34.259 we

00:01:36.479 bottom
00:01:36.570 I'm

00:01:40.170 well-seasoned

00:01:40.829 cast-iron
00:01:41.490 pan
00:01:41.909 when
00:01:42.899 you
00:01:43.020 believe
00:01:43.290 the

00:01:43.500 butter
00:01:43.680 to
00:01:43.920 be
00:01:44.040 pretty
00:01:44.399 hot
00:01:44.610 go

00:01:45.090 and

00:01:45.210 throw
00:01:45.420 in
00:01:45.450 your
00:01:45.630 potatoes
00:01:46.170 and
00:01:46.470 we're
00:01:47.040 gonna

00:01:47.130 cook
00:01:47.399 this
00:01:47.549 on
00:01:47.729 medium
00:01:48.060 heat
00:01:48.240 pretty
00:01:48.540 much
00:01:48.720 the

00:01:48.869 whole
00:01:49.020 way
00:01:49.079 so
00:01:49.920 I
00:01:49.979 want

00:01:51.720 gonna
00:01:51.840 let
00:01:52.049 those
00:01:52.229 sit
00:01:52.500 there

00:01:52.740 get
00:01:53.250 in
00:01:53.399 the
00:01:53.520 initial
00:01:54.000 crust
00:01:54.390 while
00:01:55.020 we
00:01:55.170 season

00:01:55.619 and
00:01:55.799 the
00:01:56.130 seasoning
00:01:56.610 on
00:01:56.790 hashbrowns
00:01:57.420 should

00:01:57.689 be
00:01:57.840 very
00:01:58.229 simple
00:01:58.799 so

00:01:59.579 gonna
00:01:59.700 go
00:01:59.880 with

00:02:01.979 salt

00:02:02.219 so
00:02:03.210 cayenne
00:02:03.600 pepper
00:02:03.899 of
00:02:04.259 course
00:02:04.729 some
00:02:05.729 finely

00:02:06.270 ground
00:02:06.659 but
00:02:07.229 freshly
00:02:07.740 ground
00:02:08.039 black
00:02:08.280 pepper

00:02:08.399 by
00:02:09.330 the
00:02:09.390 way
00:02:09.509 get
00:02:09.660 a
00:02:09.690 pepper
00:02:09.929 grinder
00:02:10.020 why
00:02:10.560 are

00:02:10.619 you
00:02:10.800 using
00:02:10.979 pre
00:02:11.340 ground
00:02:11.580 black
00:02:11.790 pepper

00:02:12.209 there
00:02:12.629 was
00:02:12.720 probably

00:02:12.940 ground
00:02:13.270 in
00:02:13.710 1997
00:02:14.710 and
00:02:15.400 last
00:02:15.640 but
00:02:15.820 not
00:02:15.910 least
00:02:16.180 a

00:02:16.420 little
00:02:16.690 bit
00:02:16.810 of
00:02:16.930 paprika
00:02:17.130 gives
00:02:18.130 it
00:02:18.220 a
00:02:18.280 little

00:02:18.460 color
00:02:18.760 gives
00:02:19.540 it
00:02:19.630 a
00:02:19.720 touch
00:02:20.020 of
00:02:20.170 sweetness

00:02:22.480 that's
00:02:22.630 all
00:02:22.870 I
00:02:22.930 think

00:02:23.740 hash
00:02:24.160 browns

00:02:25.390 that
00:02:25.420 as
00:02:25.780 you
00:02:25.990 well
00:02:26.230 know

00:02:30.670 five

00:02:30.940 minutes
00:02:30.970 I
00:02:31.390 decided
00:02:31.450 to
00:02:31.870 give
00:02:32.020 this
00:02:32.110 a

00:02:34.780 give

00:02:34.900 this
00:02:34.990 a
00:02:35.050 little
00:02:35.230 flip
00:02:35.590 you
00:02:36.100 can
00:02:36.250 really
00:02:36.490 see

00:02:36.640 that
00:02:36.790 crust
00:02:37.150 starting
00:02:37.480 to
00:02:37.570 form
00:02:37.840 so
00:02:38.530 at
00:02:38.620 this

00:02:38.710 point
00:02:38.980 if
00:02:39.130 you've
00:02:39.250 done
00:02:39.460 everything
00:02:40.030 as
00:02:40.210 shown

00:02:40.570 there's
00:02:40.930 really
00:02:41.200 no
00:02:41.500 way
00:02:41.650 to
00:02:41.680 screw
00:02:42.040 this
00:02:42.190 up

00:02:42.400 you're
00:02:42.850 just
00:02:42.880 gonna

00:02:43.810 they're
00:02:44.200 done
00:02:44.380 now
00:02:44.710 there's
00:02:45.190 two
00:02:45.340 schools
00:02:45.580 of

00:02:45.760 thought
00:02:45.820 you
00:02:46.300 can
00:02:46.450 just
00:02:46.630 let
00:02:46.780 them
00:02:46.870 sit
00:02:47.110 leave

00:02:47.470 them
00:02:47.620 be
00:02:47.770 the
00:02:48.310 outside
00:02:48.700 will
00:02:48.820 get
00:02:48.940 crusty
00:02:49.210 and

00:02:49.630 the
00:02:49.690 inside
00:02:49.990 will
00:02:50.110 stay
00:02:50.290 kind
00:02:50.440 of
00:02:50.560 white
00:02:50.770 you

00:02:51.190 know
00:02:51.280 look
00:02:51.640 like
00:02:51.760 shredded
00:02:52.120 potato
00:02:52.420 or
00:02:52.990 you

00:02:53.470 can
00:02:53.620 use
00:02:53.770 my
00:02:53.980 method
00:02:54.220 I
00:02:54.610 like
00:02:55.030 to
00:02:55.180 keep

00:02:55.330 stirring
00:02:55.840 the
00:02:55.960 crust
00:02:56.320 as
00:02:56.710 soon
00:02:56.890 as
00:02:57.010 it
00:02:57.130 forms

00:02:57.580 back
00:02:58.150 into
00:02:58.660 the
00:02:58.780 potato
00:02:59.110 so
00:02:59.680 I
00:02:59.740 let
00:02:59.920 it
00:03:00.010 cook

00:03:00.130 for
00:03:00.280 two
00:03:00.430 or
00:03:00.550 three
00:03:00.700 minutes
00:03:01.030 I
00:03:01.300 take
00:03:01.720 the

00:03:01.840 spatula
00:03:02.320 I
00:03:02.470 flip
00:03:02.710 it
00:03:02.830 over
00:03:02.980 that
00:03:03.700 crusty

00:03:04.150 surface
00:03:04.390 comes
00:03:04.870 up
00:03:05.080 sort
00:03:06.010 of
00:03:06.070 gets
00:03:06.190 mixed
00:03:06.370 back

00:03:06.580 into
00:03:06.850 the
00:03:06.970 potato
00:03:07.300 and
00:03:07.690 then
00:03:08.140 it
00:03:08.320 reek
00:03:08.650 rusts

00:03:09.250 so
00:03:09.790 worried
00:03:09.940 about
00:03:09.970 here
00:03:10.300 most
00:03:10.540 normal
00:03:10.870 people

00:03:11.020 would
00:03:11.380 be
00:03:11.530 thinking
00:03:11.980 they're
00:03:12.220 done
00:03:12.400 and
00:03:12.640 they

00:03:13.120 would
00:03:13.360 be
00:03:13.510 but
00:03:14.110 I
00:03:14.170 really
00:03:14.560 like
00:03:14.710 mine
00:03:14.890 cooked

00:03:15.130 well
00:03:15.280 done

00:03:15.700 just
00:03:16.120 like
00:03:16.270 to
00:03:16.390 let
00:03:16.510 mine
00:03:16.690 sit

00:03:16.720 and
00:03:17.350 get
00:03:17.470 crusty
00:03:17.800 and
00:03:18.100 crusty
00:03:18.520 or
00:03:18.550 and
00:03:18.730 crusty

00:03:19.120 ER
00:03:19.180 and
00:03:19.390 the
00:03:19.720 inside
00:03:20.110 almost
00:03:20.590 turns
00:03:20.920 into
00:03:21.130 like

00:03:21.310 a
00:03:21.340 mashed
00:03:21.580 potato
00:03:21.670 but

00:03:26.200 of
00:03:27.010 course
00:03:27.160 it
00:03:27.310 would
00:03:27.430 look
00:03:27.550 better
00:03:27.700 if

00:03:27.910 I'd
00:03:28.030 focus
