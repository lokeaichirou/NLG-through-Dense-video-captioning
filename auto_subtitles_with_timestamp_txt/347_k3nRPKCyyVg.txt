00:00:08.660 all
00:00:09.660 right
00:00:09.870 it's
00:00:10.200 been
00:00:10.380 cooked
00:00:11.370 30
00:00:11.880 minutes
00:00:12.420 so

00:00:13.219 you
00:00:14.219 can
00:00:14.250 skim
00:00:14.790 out
00:00:14.910 all
00:00:15.179 the
00:00:15.389 impurity

00:00:15.900 several
00:00:16.230 times
00:00:16.590 I
00:00:16.890 did
00:00:17.160 and
00:00:17.539 I
00:00:18.539 can
00:00:18.920 strain
00:00:19.920 it

00:00:19.949 because
00:00:20.490 I
00:00:21.180 need
00:00:21.570 the
00:00:21.750 broth
00:00:22.050 that's
00:00:22.289 why
00:00:22.590 I

00:00:22.619 don't
00:00:22.920 strain
00:00:23.670 it
00:00:24.109 right
00:00:25.109 onto
00:00:25.380 the
00:00:25.590 sink
00:00:30.019 and

00:00:35.080 new
00:00:35.680 putt
00:00:35.980 for
00:00:36.880 that
00:00:37.500 so
00:00:38.500 without
00:00:38.860 heat
00:00:41.070 pick

00:00:42.070 it
00:00:42.100 up
00:00:47.310 we
00:00:48.310 have
00:00:48.340 a
00:00:48.520 source
00:00:48.850 right
00:00:49.120 let
00:00:49.690 me
00:00:49.870 add

00:00:50.080 just
00:00:52.320 a
00:00:53.320 thumb
00:00:53.500 seed
00:00:53.739 oil
00:00:54.120 so
00:00:55.120 mix
00:00:55.330 it
00:00:55.510 all
00:00:55.660 well

00:00:55.870 you
00:00:56.620 cannot
00:00:57.300 marinate
00:00:58.300 for
00:00:58.690 30
00:00:58.750 minutes
00:00:59.530 like

00:00:59.800 that
00:00:59.860 that's
00:01:00.670 why
00:01:00.940 I
00:01:00.970 said
00:01:01.510 we
00:01:01.930 need
00:01:02.110 lots
00:01:02.379 of

00:01:02.530 care
00:01:02.590 and
00:01:03.340 time
00:01:03.760 to
00:01:04.180 make
00:01:04.360 it
00:01:04.570 pay
00:01:08.009 if
00:01:09.009 you
00:01:09.070 have

00:01:09.460 a
00:01:09.490 more
00:01:09.820 time
00:01:10.180 you
00:01:10.720 can
00:01:10.990 keep
00:01:11.200 reducing
00:01:11.530 so
00:01:12.490 you

00:01:12.550 can
00:01:12.820 get
00:01:13.119 more
00:01:13.990 deep
00:01:14.560 flavor
00:01:15.100 of
00:01:15.369 broth
00:01:15.790 right

00:01:16.330 so
00:01:16.750 let
00:01:16.990 me
00:01:17.020 just
00:01:17.320 put
00:01:17.770 it
00:01:17.830 like
00:01:18.040 that

00:01:18.759 so
00:01:19.149 get
00:01:19.360 even
00:01:19.810 flavor
00:01:20.380 you

00:01:27.610 leaves
00:01:27.880 like
00:01:28.300 that

00:02:23.260 it
00:02:23.380 before
00:02:23.500 even

00:02:24.040 she's
00:02:24.280 Korean
00:02:24.819 is
00:02:25.410 she's

00:02:30.830 and
00:02:31.830 she
00:02:32.550 was
00:02:33.330 almost
00:02:33.510 cry
00:02:33.900 I
00:02:33.930 never
00:02:34.380 done
00:02:34.620 it

00:02:34.740 before
00:02:34.860 what
00:02:35.220 I'm
00:02:35.310 gonna

00:02:36.360 her

00:02:36.630 my

00:02:37.380 and
00:02:37.620 it
00:02:38.370 turns

00:02:39.060 really
00:02:39.360 well

00:02:39.720 and
00:02:39.930 you

00:02:43.950 dinner

00:02:44.250 I

00:02:44.730 you
00:02:44.880 can
00:02:45.120 make
00:02:45.330 it

00:02:46.380 mistake
00:02:46.860 all
00:02:47.100 right

00:02:47.630 while
00:02:48.630 we
00:02:48.840 are
00:02:48.870 waiting

00:02:49.500 I
00:02:49.830 told

00:02:52.640 so
00:02:53.640 you
00:02:54.060 put
00:02:54.540 a
00:02:54.870 little
00:02:55.170 bit
00:02:55.440 of
