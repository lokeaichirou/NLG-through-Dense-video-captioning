00:03:22.410 there
00:03:23.410 we

00:03:25.540 anyway
00:03:25.750 I
00:03:26.170 forgot

00:03:32.680 13
00:03:33.130 points
00:03:33.940 per
00:03:34.120 pizza
00:03:34.830 but
00:03:35.830 the
00:03:36.580 recipe

00:03:36.970 actually
00:03:37.209 calls
00:03:37.510 for
00:03:38.050 you
00:03:38.440 to
00:03:38.680 make
00:03:38.860 a
00:03:39.069 speedy

00:03:39.550 tomato
00:03:39.850 sauce
00:03:40.410 but
00:03:41.410 I've
00:03:41.530 used
00:03:41.769 tomato
00:03:42.100 puree
