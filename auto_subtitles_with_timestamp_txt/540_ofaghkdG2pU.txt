00:00:21.480 have
00:00:21.660 two

00:00:21.810 restaurants
00:00:21.960 I
00:00:22.380 notice
00:00:22.710 that
00:00:22.800 many
00:00:23.070 people

00:00:58.649 it
00:00:58.829 let's
00:00:59.219 start

00:00:59.510 the
00:01:00.510 most
00:01:00.719 important
00:01:01.350 step
00:01:01.649 is
00:01:01.890 this
00:01:02.309 one
00:01:02.579 make

00:01:02.969 sure
00:01:03.000 that
00:01:03.480 the
00:01:03.660 mussels
00:01:04.140 are
00:01:04.379 fresh
00:01:04.949 and
00:01:05.250 the

00:01:05.790 way
00:01:05.939 to
00:01:06.000 test
00:01:06.330 this
00:01:06.540 is
00:01:06.810 of
00:01:07.080 course
00:01:07.290 you
00:01:07.560 buy

00:01:07.740 the
00:01:07.799 fresh
00:01:08.159 and
00:01:08.340 then
00:01:08.580 here
00:01:09.060 I
00:01:09.210 put
00:01:09.750 them
00:01:09.869 in

00:01:09.990 cold
00:01:10.170 water
00:01:10.500 and
00:01:10.799 as
00:01:11.430 you
00:01:11.490 notice
00:01:11.880 they're

00:01:12.720 they're
00:01:12.960 not
00:01:13.110 open
00:01:13.560 and
00:01:13.830 even
00:01:14.400 if
00:01:14.610 they're
00:01:14.790 a

00:01:14.820 little
00:01:14.909 open
00:01:15.479 if
00:01:15.659 I
00:01:15.780 push
00:01:16.110 a
00:01:16.140 little
00:01:16.500 bit
00:01:16.650 on

00:01:16.830 the
00:01:17.270 mussel
00:01:18.270 is
00:01:18.450 going
00:01:18.750 to
00:01:18.930 close
00:01:19.170 itself
00:01:19.799 if

00:01:20.220 the
00:01:20.280 mussel
00:01:21.180 is
00:01:21.299 open
00:01:21.780 and
00:01:21.990 doesn't
00:01:22.350 close
00:01:22.470 in

00:01:22.680 cold
00:01:22.890 water
00:01:23.130 or
00:01:23.490 when
00:01:23.670 you
00:01:23.759 touch
00:01:23.970 it
00:01:24.030 then

00:01:24.630 throw
00:01:25.049 it
00:01:25.320 right
00:01:25.650 away

00:01:26.100 it
00:01:26.159 means
00:01:26.460 it's
00:01:26.729 dead
00:01:27.030 the
00:01:27.509 mussels
00:01:27.960 are
00:01:28.229 alive

00:01:29.070 and
00:01:29.400 that's
00:01:29.610 why
00:01:29.759 they
00:01:30.000 react
00:01:30.360 to
00:01:30.689 the
00:01:30.720 cold

00:01:31.079 water
00:01:31.700 unfortunately
00:01:32.700 we
00:01:32.820 have
00:01:32.970 to
00:01:33.119 cook
00:01:33.210 them

00:01:33.390 alive
00:01:33.689 but
00:01:33.930 you'll
00:01:34.110 forget
00:01:34.409 this
00:01:34.590 fact
00:01:34.890 when

00:01:35.100 you
00:01:35.189 eat
00:01:35.340 them
00:01:35.520 because
00:01:35.670 they're
00:01:35.970 very
00:01:36.090 yummy

00:01:36.390 so
00:01:36.960 if
00:01:37.200 one
00:01:37.500 of
00:01:37.619 the
00:01:37.710 mussels
00:01:38.040 is
00:01:38.189 dead
00:01:38.460 it

00:01:38.820 means
00:01:39.090 it's
00:01:39.240 going
00:01:39.329 to
00:01:39.420 be
00:01:39.540 toxic

00:01:40.110 and
00:01:40.290 you're
00:01:40.409 going
00:01:40.560 to
00:01:40.650 get
00:01:40.799 sick
00:01:41.040 okay
00:01:41.610 so

00:01:42.060 really
00:01:42.420 really
00:01:42.659 important
00:01:43.229 and
00:01:44.070 also
00:01:44.280 make

00:01:44.579 sure
00:01:44.790 you
00:01:45.000 wash
00:01:45.240 your
00:01:45.270 mussels
00:01:45.960 very
00:01:46.409 well
00:01:46.740 and

00:01:46.950 you
00:01:47.040 scrub
00:01:47.430 them
00:01:47.759 and

00:01:48.480 clean
00:01:48.660 I've
00:01:48.870 already
00:01:49.230 done
00:01:49.440 that
00:01:49.620 so
00:01:49.890 I'm

00:01:50.310 ready
00:01:50.850 to
00:01:51.120 cook
00:01:51.270 them
00:01:52.070 we
00:01:53.070 need
00:01:53.310 a
00:01:53.490 large
00:01:53.820 pot

00:02:28.020 tomatoes

00:02:28.500 start
00:02:28.770 bubbling

00:02:53.280 away
00:02:53.400 I
00:02:53.730 didn't

00:02:54.660 see

00:02:57.660 sauce
00:02:57.890 anyway
00:02:58.890 so

00:03:14.430 liquid
00:03:14.610 in

00:03:17.820 sauce
00:03:18.060 is
00:03:18.480 there
00:03:19.020 that's

00:03:19.410 good
