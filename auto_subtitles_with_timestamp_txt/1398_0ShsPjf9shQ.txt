00:00:00.469 hello
00:00:01.469 today
00:00:01.860 we're
00:00:02.010 making
00:00:02.129 meatloaf

00:00:03.030 this
00:00:03.480 is
00:00:03.689 a
00:00:03.959 recipe
00:00:04.259 that
00:00:04.529 I
00:00:04.710 make
00:00:04.890 quite
00:00:05.220 often

00:00:05.400 and
00:00:05.759 just
00:00:06.240 like
00:00:06.750 any
00:00:07.020 kind
00:00:07.410 of
00:00:07.470 meatloaf
00:00:07.799 it

00:00:08.700 can
00:00:08.910 be
00:00:09.059 really
00:00:09.420 individualized
00:00:10.080 to
00:00:10.380 your
00:00:10.500 own

00:00:10.620 specific
00:00:10.920 tastes
00:00:11.370 put
00:00:11.759 whatever
00:00:11.880 you
00:00:12.059 want
00:00:12.150 in

00:00:12.480 it
00:00:12.599 but
00:00:12.840 this
00:00:12.960 is
00:00:13.110 what
00:00:13.259 I
00:00:13.440 generally
00:00:13.950 put
00:00:14.130 in

00:00:14.280 mine
00:00:15.080 as
00:00:16.080 a
00:00:16.139 filler
00:00:16.770 I
00:00:17.010 put
00:00:17.310 1/2
00:00:17.730 cup
00:00:17.789 of
00:00:18.090 dry

00:00:18.480 bread
00:00:18.539 crumbs
00:00:19.070 1/2
00:00:20.070 cup
00:00:20.369 of
00:00:20.400 quick
00:00:21.119 cooking

00:00:21.390 oats
00:00:21.600 although
00:00:22.199 you
00:00:22.260 could
00:00:22.470 use
00:00:22.590 large
00:00:22.859 flake

00:00:23.160 oats
00:00:23.369 as
00:00:23.609 well
00:00:23.850 to
00:00:24.600 this
00:00:24.720 I
00:00:24.869 add
00:00:25.019 1
00:00:25.260 teaspoon
00:00:25.800 of

00:00:26.010 salt
00:00:26.070 about
00:00:26.970 a
00:00:27.210 teaspoon
00:00:27.359 of
00:00:27.990 pepper
00:00:30.890 about

00:00:31.890 1/2
00:00:32.219 cup
00:00:32.279 of
00:00:32.550 milk
00:00:35.540 2
00:00:36.540 beaten
00:00:36.840 eggs
00:00:36.989 and
00:00:39.290 some

00:00:40.290 garlic
00:00:40.469 powder
00:00:40.860 I
00:00:41.010 guess
00:00:41.280 that's
00:00:41.460 about
00:00:41.640 a

00:00:41.700 teaspoon
00:00:42.300 and
00:00:42.600 I
00:00:42.840 put
00:00:43.020 some
00:00:43.260 minced
00:00:43.710 dried

00:00:43.920 onion
00:00:44.340 because
00:00:44.789 max
00:00:45.030 doesn't
00:00:45.239 like
00:00:45.390 the
00:00:45.510 fresh

00:00:45.690 onions
00:00:45.989 too
00:00:46.170 much
00:00:46.320 in
00:00:46.469 there
00:00:46.620 so
00:00:46.860 it
00:00:47.309 doesn't

00:00:47.550 seem
00:00:47.670 to
00:00:47.789 mind
00:00:47.910 the
00:00:48.059 dried
00:00:48.270 onions
00:00:48.570 and
00:00:48.780 a
00:00:49.230 few

00:00:49.379 shakes
00:00:49.649 of
00:00:49.920 Worcester
00:00:50.250 sauce
00:00:50.430 and
00:00:50.850 they're

00:00:51.690 going
00:00:51.870 to
00:00:51.960 blend
00:00:52.140 this
00:00:52.230 together
00:00:52.410 now
00:00:53.190 really

00:00:53.520 the
00:00:53.699 only
00:00:54.180 really
00:00:54.600 good
00:00:54.809 way
00:00:54.960 to
00:00:55.770 blend

00:00:56.010 meatloaf
00:00:56.640 is
00:00:57.180 with
00:00:57.600 your
00:00:57.750 hands
00:00:58.109 so
00:00:58.670 that's

00:00:59.910 going
00:01:00.090 to
00:01:00.149 do
00:01:00.270 next

00:01:02.930 ok
00:01:03.930 there's
00:01:04.170 two
00:01:05.510 schools
00:01:06.510 of
00:01:06.689 thought

00:02:23.730 of

00:02:23.880 the
00:02:23.940 meatloaf
00:02:24.380 because

00:02:25.950 a

00:02:26.070 little

00:02:32.700 the
00:02:32.820 center
00:02:33.060 is
00:02:33.470 at
00:02:34.470 least

00:02:39.180 it's

00:02:39.480 safe
00:02:39.660 T
00:02:40.970 then
00:02:41.970 you
00:02:42.120 just
00:02:42.330 let
00:02:42.480 it
00:02:42.510 rest
00:02:42.840 for

00:02:43.170 about
00:02:43.440 15
00:02:43.680 minutes
00:02:44.340 and
00:02:44.580 then
00:02:44.640 you
00:02:45.540 can
00:02:45.780 slice

00:02:46.020 it
00:02:46.050 up
