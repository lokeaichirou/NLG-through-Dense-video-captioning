00:01:36.280 cooking

00:01:36.610 it
00:01:36.759 for
00:01:36.970 an
00:01:37.090 hour
00:01:38.250 right
00:01:39.280 this
00:01:40.149 is
00:01:40.360 ready

00:01:42.520 it's
00:01:42.609 time

00:01:43.380 fish
00:01:44.380 it
00:01:44.560 out
00:01:44.649 so
00:01:45.429 we
00:01:46.060 take
00:01:46.270 our

00:01:46.420 onion
00:01:46.990 the

00:01:51.100 a
00:01:51.219 little

00:01:51.399 bit
00:01:51.610 so
00:01:51.789 it
00:01:51.909 doesn't
00:01:52.240 burn
00:01:52.360 our
00:01:52.600 fingers
00:01:53.759 but

00:01:54.759 the
00:01:55.030 stock
00:01:55.390 you
00:01:55.780 want
00:01:55.899 to
00:01:56.049 keep
00:01:56.259 because
00:01:57.159 you

00:01:57.369 might
00:01:57.549 need
00:01:57.789 it
00:01:57.939 later
00:01:58.119 it's
00:01:58.479 pretty
00:01:58.810 fun
00:01:59.079 so
00:01:59.319 I

00:01:59.350 wouldn't
00:01:59.710 use
00:01:59.799 it
00:01:59.950 for
00:02:00.100 anything
00:02:00.429 else
00:02:00.729 but
00:02:00.969 we

00:02:01.179 might
00:02:01.420 need
00:02:01.920 a
00:02:02.920 few
00:02:03.899 tablespoon
00:02:04.899 or
00:02:05.229 half
00:02:05.829 a

00:02:05.950 cup
00:02:06.189 for

00:04:48.720 boiling

00:04:48.990 it's
00:04:49.440 not
00:04:49.710 boiling
00:04:49.920 hot
00:04:50.250 but
00:04:50.580 it's
00:04:50.730 still
00:04:51.000 very

00:04:51.480 very
00:04:51.660 warm
00:04:52.080 very

00:04:56.460 as
00:04:56.580 you
00:04:56.730 can
00:04:56.850 see

00:04:56.960 when
00:04:57.960 it
00:04:58.110 starts
00:04:58.140 forming
00:04:59.130 a
00:04:59.340 bowl
00:04:59.760 like
00:05:00.240 this

00:05:00.270 I'm
00:05:00.720 checking
00:05:00.960 if
00:05:01.230 it's
00:05:01.380 soft
00:05:01.650 and
00:05:02.040 then
00:05:02.730 you

00:05:02.880 should
00:05:03.060 run
00:05:03.270 it
00:05:03.450 for
00:05:03.690 another
00:05:04.370 minute
00:05:05.370 or
00:05:05.640 so

00:05:05.700 and
00:05:06.180 then
00:05:06.750 it's
00:05:07.080 ready

00:05:09.130 go
00:05:10.290 lightly
00:05:11.290 flour
00:05:12.220 the
00:05:12.370 surface
00:05:14.310 transfer

00:05:15.310 our
00:05:16.020 so
00:05:17.020 an
00:05:17.290 end
00:05:17.530 and
00:05:17.800 now
00:05:17.950 I'm
00:05:18.100 going
00:05:18.370 to
00:05:18.520 need

00:05:18.730 it
00:05:18.880 a
00:05:18.910 few
00:05:19.150 times
00:05:19.360 but
00:05:20.080 it
00:05:20.230 gets
00:05:20.410 elastic
00:05:21.010 and

00:05:21.190 not
00:05:21.370 sticky
00:05:21.760 very
00:05:22.030 quickly
00:05:23.340 okay
00:05:24.340 so
00:05:24.520 now
00:05:25.030 I'm

00:05:25.180 cutting
00:05:25.390 it
00:05:25.660 in
00:05:25.780 half
00:05:25.890 1/2
00:05:26.950 I'm

00:05:37.540 flipping
00:05:38.140 the
00:05:38.290 dough
