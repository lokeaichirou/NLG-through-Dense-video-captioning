00:06:27.600 an
00:06:27.690 immersion
00:06:27.930 blender
00:06:28.080 which

00:06:38.729 simmer
00:06:38.880 for
00:06:39.060 five

00:06:39.240 minutes

00:06:46.950 off

00:06:47.190 because
00:06:47.790 you
00:06:47.940 don't
00:06:48.240 you
00:06:48.570 never

00:06:51.450 the
00:06:51.570 pot
00:06:51.780 on
00:06:52.050 because
00:06:52.470 it
00:06:52.590 could
00:06:53.100 bubble
00:06:53.280 up

00:06:53.760 and

00:06:54.930 then

00:06:55.020 nothing
00:06:55.860 is
00:06:56.010 worth
00:06:56.220 getting
00:06:56.880 hurt
00:06:56.910 remember

00:06:57.570 that

00:06:57.930 matter
00:06:58.050 how
00:06:58.260 good
00:06:58.440 it
00:06:58.560 is
00:06:58.590 this

00:06:59.490 the
00:06:59.580 immersion
00:06:59.730 blender
00:06:59.960 it's
00:07:00.960 basically

00:07:01.590 blender
00:07:02.070 that
00:07:02.400 I

00:07:05.460 if
00:07:05.850 we
00:07:05.970 process
00:07:06.420 so

00:07:06.600 whatever
