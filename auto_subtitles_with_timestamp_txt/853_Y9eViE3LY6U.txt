00:00:08.069 chef
00:00:22.670 first
00:00:23.670 things
00:00:23.939 first
00:00:24.029 I'm
00:00:24.420 just
00:00:24.449 making

00:00:24.900 a
00:00:24.960 boiled
00:00:25.289 egg
00:00:25.470 now
00:00:25.710 you've
00:00:25.949 seen
00:00:26.160 me
00:00:26.279 make

00:00:26.400 boiled
00:00:26.760 eggs
00:00:26.910 before
00:00:27.180 in
00:00:27.300 the
00:00:27.359 past
00:00:27.510 but

00:00:27.779 basically
00:00:28.170 we're
00:00:28.470 just
00:00:28.500 going
00:00:28.650 to
00:00:28.769 boil
00:00:29.010 the

00:00:29.130 egg
00:00:29.310 for
00:00:29.640 about
00:00:29.880 six
00:00:30.539 to
00:00:30.660 seven
00:00:30.689 minutes
00:00:31.170 until

00:00:31.289 it's
00:00:31.529 hard-boiled
00:00:32.130 let
00:00:32.669 it
00:00:32.759 cool
00:00:32.940 off
00:00:33.180 peel

00:00:33.719 off
00:00:33.899 the
00:00:34.050 shell
00:00:34.079 and
00:00:34.590 then
00:00:34.739 dice
00:00:35.100 it
00:00:35.280 up
00:00:35.370 into

00:00:35.610 little
00:00:35.880 pieces

00:00:36.450 I'm
00:00:36.719 also
00:00:36.870 cooking
00:00:37.230 up
00:00:37.469 some
00:00:37.680 bacon
00:00:38.280 I'm
00:00:38.790 just

00:00:39.000 using
00:00:39.149 some
00:00:39.270 short
00:00:39.750 rivals
00:00:40.260 bacon
00:00:40.590 which
00:00:40.710 I've

00:00:40.829 just
00:00:40.860 chopped
00:00:41.340 up
00:00:41.550 we're
00:00:42.059 just
00:00:42.090 going
00:00:42.390 to
00:00:42.450 fry

00:00:43.050 this
00:00:43.110 up
00:00:43.320 until
00:00:43.860 it's
00:00:43.980 nice
00:00:44.190 and
00:00:44.219 crispy
00:00:48.950 next

00:00:49.950 I'm
00:00:50.100 making
00:00:50.250 some
00:00:50.640 croutons
00:00:50.879 now

00:00:51.300 traditionally
00:00:51.809 croutons
00:00:52.230 are
00:00:52.530 little
00:00:52.860 cubes

00:00:53.219 of
00:00:53.430 bread
00:00:53.550 which
00:00:53.850 are
00:00:54.000 deep
00:00:54.149 fried
00:00:54.480 I'm
00:00:54.750 doing

00:00:55.320 a
00:00:55.379 slight
00:00:55.559 variation
00:00:56.100 on
00:00:56.160 this
00:00:56.309 because
00:00:56.489 I

00:00:56.579 don't
00:00:56.760 like
00:00:56.910 to
00:00:57.030 deep
00:00:57.180 fry
00:00:57.210 bread
00:00:57.660 I
00:00:57.719 find
00:00:58.020 it

00:00:58.109 really
00:00:58.199 greasing
00:00:58.710 oily
00:00:59.010 so
00:00:59.489 I'm
00:00:59.730 just
00:00:59.940 going

00:01:00.090 to
00:01:00.149 bake
00:01:00.390 them
00:01:00.660 I'm
00:01:01.020 going
00:01:01.199 to
00:01:01.260 spray
00:01:01.530 them

00:01:01.710 with
00:01:01.829 a
00:01:01.980 little
00:01:02.280 bit
00:01:02.430 of
00:01:02.460 cooking
00:01:02.879 spray
00:01:05.960 then

00:01:06.960 place
00:01:07.200 them
00:01:07.409 into
00:01:07.619 an
00:01:07.860 oven
00:01:08.040 180
00:01:08.850 degrees

00:01:09.299 Celsius
00:01:09.780 for
00:01:09.810 about
00:01:10.020 five
00:01:10.350 to
00:01:10.500 ten
00:01:10.650 minutes
00:01:10.920 or

00:01:11.070 until
00:01:11.189 they're
00:01:11.460 nice
00:01:11.640 and
00:01:11.670 golden
00:01:11.880 toasted

00:01:12.689 then
00:01:13.140 we'll
00:01:13.439 be
00:01:13.530 ready
00:01:13.650 to
00:01:13.830 move
00:01:13.950 on
00:01:14.130 croutons

00:01:14.790 are
00:01:14.939 looking
00:01:15.150 golden
00:01:15.509 and
00:01:15.630 gorgeous
00:01:16.020 so
00:01:16.170 let's

00:01:16.350 just
00:01:16.560 leave
00:01:16.710 those
00:01:16.799 aside
00:01:17.159 for
00:01:17.310 the
00:01:17.369 moment

00:01:17.430 while

00:01:22.890 and
00:01:23.460 to
00:01:23.700 that
00:01:23.850 I'm
00:01:23.939 adding
