00:02:51.409 taste

00:02:51.560 like
00:02:51.709 glue
00:02:52.040 it
00:02:52.220 tastes
00:02:52.579 like
00:02:53.209 a
00:02:53.329 nice
00:02:54.019 cook

00:02:55.120 just
00:02:56.120 keep
00:02:56.269 stirring
00:02:56.510 otherwise

00:02:57.079 stick
00:02:58.209 now
00:02:59.209 to

00:03:02.720 slowly
00:03:03.019 and

00:03:03.500 whisking
00:03:03.920 the
00:03:04.069 whole
00:03:04.310 time
00:03:04.730 we're
00:03:05.090 stirring

00:03:05.329 us
00:03:05.629 today
00:03:05.989 because
00:03:06.650 I'm
00:03:06.890 just
00:03:07.069 trying
00:03:07.340 to

00:03:07.400 avoid
00:03:07.579 any
00:03:08.060 lumps
00:03:08.409 so
00:03:09.409 just

00:03:11.480 by
00:03:11.599 little
00:03:12.730 now
00:03:13.730 that
00:03:13.909 I
00:03:13.970 added

00:03:15.769 nice
00:03:15.950 and

00:03:16.220 smooth
00:03:16.430 so
00:03:16.459 I
00:03:16.670 have
00:03:16.940 to
00:03:17.090 stir
00:03:17.659 it
00:03:17.780 for
00:03:17.900 about
00:03:17.989 a

00:03:18.109 minute
00:03:18.319 you
00:03:18.769 want
00:03:18.920 to
00:03:18.980 cook
00:03:19.129 this
00:03:19.310 until
00:03:19.489 it's

00:03:19.760 nice
00:03:19.940 and
00:03:19.970 thick
00:03:20.239 which
00:03:20.540 will
00:03:20.690 take
00:03:20.840 about

00:03:21.079 three
00:03:21.319 to
00:03:21.409 four
00:03:21.680 minutes
00:03:21.829 and
00:03:22.370 also
00:03:22.909 the

00:03:23.390 contact
00:03:23.870 that's
00:03:23.959 perfectly
00:03:24.349 cooked
00:03:24.590 I
00:03:24.709 turn

00:03:25.010 it
00:03:25.099 off
00:03:25.190 and
00:03:25.250 now
00:03:25.579 I'm
00:03:25.700 just
00:03:25.730 going
00:03:25.940 to
00:03:26.000 drain

00:03:26.299 it
00:03:26.329 onto
00:03:26.840 just
00:03:27.500 a
00:03:27.620 little
00:03:27.829 a
00:03:27.950 plate
00:03:28.280 and
00:03:28.549 then

00:03:29.269 we're
00:03:29.359 going
00:03:29.450 to
00:03:29.510 finish
00:03:29.690 assembling
00:03:30.349 the

00:03:30.829 whole
00:03:30.859 thing
00:03:31.900 my
00:03:32.900 bechamel
00:03:33.410 looks
00:03:33.590 perfect

00:03:34.220 but
00:03:34.549 now
00:03:34.700 I
00:03:34.730 need
00:03:35.000 to
00:03:35.180 be
00:03:35.299 seasoned
00:03:35.810 we're
00:03:36.230 just

00:03:36.349 going
00:03:36.470 to
00:03:36.500 season
00:03:36.680 with
00:03:36.950 black
00:03:37.099 pepper
00:03:37.299 my

00:03:38.299 mother
00:03:38.480 would
00:03:38.660 have
00:03:38.690 a
00:03:38.810 heart
00:03:38.840 attack
00:03:39.079 at
00:03:39.290 this

00:03:39.410 point
00:03:39.620 at
00:03:39.769 this
00:03:39.919 point
00:03:40.040 because
00:03:40.400 she
00:03:40.669 likes
00:03:40.910 to

00:03:41.000 use
00:03:41.209 white
00:03:41.450 pepper
00:03:41.690 in
00:03:41.930 her
00:03:42.019 bechamel
00:03:42.470 but

00:03:43.069 she's
00:03:43.190 not
00:03:43.310 here
00:03:43.489 today
00:03:43.639 so
00:03:43.910 I'm
00:03:44.629 going
00:03:44.810 to
00:03:44.870 use

00:03:44.959 black
00:03:45.139 pepper
00:03:45.379 some
00:03:46.370 salt
00:03:46.430 not
00:03:47.209 too
00:03:47.269 much
00:03:47.480 salt

00:03:47.840 only
00:03:48.230 because
00:03:48.530 we
00:03:48.709 have
00:03:48.889 this
00:03:49.040 plaster
00:03:49.849 that's

00:03:49.940 already
00:03:50.180 been
00:03:50.359 seasoned
00:03:50.810 with
00:03:50.840 salt
00:03:51.139 and

00:03:51.500 we're
00:03:52.160 adding
00:03:52.280 so
00:03:52.669 many
00:03:52.849 cheeses
00:03:53.419 and
00:03:53.720 the

00:03:54.169 pancetta
00:03:54.650 that
00:03:54.980 it
00:03:55.190 doesn't
00:03:55.549 really
00:03:55.669 need
00:03:55.760 it

00:03:56.150 I'm
00:03:56.900 then
00:03:57.260 going
00:03:57.410 to
00:03:57.530 add
00:03:57.760 my
00:03:58.760 grated
00:03:59.629 sharp

00:04:00.109 cheddar
00:04:00.940 my
00:04:01.940 grated
00:04:02.419 mozzarella
00:04:02.709 this
00:04:03.709 whole

00:04:03.980 milk
00:04:04.220 mozzarella
00:04:04.370 melts
00:04:05.060 beautifully
00:04:05.359 and

00:04:06.220 half
00:04:07.220 of
00:04:07.730 the
00:04:08.030 parmigiano
00:04:08.540 and
00:04:09.370 I'll
00:04:10.370 show
00:04:10.549 you

00:04:10.609 why
00:04:10.879 and
00:04:11.239 when
00:04:11.329 you're
00:04:11.449 doing
00:04:11.569 half
00:04:11.930 and
00:04:12.139 I'm

00:04:12.199 just
00:04:12.319 going
00:04:12.440 to
00:04:12.560 stir
00:04:12.889 this
00:04:13.069 all
00:04:13.280 together

00:04:13.519 because
00:04:14.510 this
00:04:14.750 is
00:04:14.870 really
00:04:15.379 hot
00:04:15.620 until
00:04:16.280 all
00:04:16.519 the

00:04:16.609 cheese's
00:04:17.120 have
00:04:17.810 melted
00:04:18.289 beautifully
00:04:19.660 that

00:04:20.660 looks
00:04:20.930 absolutely
00:04:21.470 gorgeous
00:04:22.370 now
00:04:23.300 I'm
00:04:23.930 going

00:04:24.380 to
00:04:24.500 just
00:04:24.710 take
00:04:24.949 my
00:04:24.979 pasta
00:04:25.729 that
00:04:25.849 I
00:04:25.910 drained
00:04:26.449 and

00:04:26.810 I've
00:04:26.930 let
00:04:27.139 this
00:04:27.260 cook
00:04:27.470 until
00:04:27.530 it's
00:04:27.979 nice
00:04:28.220 and

00:04:28.250 al
00:04:28.580 dente
00:04:28.610 actually
00:04:29.570 a
00:04:29.750 little
00:04:30.289 bit
00:04:30.440 shorter

00:04:30.919 you
00:04:31.610 know
00:04:31.640 a
00:04:31.760 little
00:04:31.940 bit
00:04:32.030 less
00:04:32.240 than
00:04:32.450 al
00:04:32.570 dente

00:04:32.990 only
00:04:33.200 because
00:04:33.409 it's
00:04:33.530 going
00:04:33.650 to
00:04:33.710 be
00:04:33.890 in
00:04:34.010 the

00:04:34.099 oven
00:04:34.219 for
00:04:34.370 a
00:04:34.550 little
00:04:34.760 bit

00:04:35.080 and
00:04:35.199 I
00:04:35.319 want
00:04:35.500 to
00:04:35.560 overcook
00:04:35.949 it
00:04:36.129 I'm
00:04:37.030 then
00:04:37.449 going

00:04:37.599 to
00:04:37.840 add
00:04:37.990 my
00:04:38.460 creamy
00:04:39.460 cheese
00:04:39.879 sauce
00:04:40.270 I
00:04:40.629 think

00:04:40.810 it's
00:04:40.930 plenty
00:04:42.330 chew
00:04:43.330 my
00:04:44.080 pasta
00:04:44.680 and
00:04:44.889 I'm
00:04:44.949 just

00:04:45.069 going
00:04:45.220 to
00:04:45.250 mix
00:04:45.460 it
00:04:45.610 all
00:04:45.759 together
00:04:46.000 with
00:04:46.419 a

00:04:46.449 punch
00:04:46.659 it
00:04:46.840 down
00:04:47.699 just
00:04:48.699 mix
00:04:49.090 it
00:04:49.270 all
00:04:49.449 up
00:04:50.050 like
00:04:50.259 so

00:04:52.050 I'm
00:04:53.050 just
00:04:53.409 putting
00:04:53.710 this
00:04:53.860 into
00:04:54.220 my
00:04:54.370 casserole

00:04:55.060 dish
00:04:56.220 trying
00:04:57.220 to
00:04:57.280 get
00:04:57.430 it
00:04:57.629 all
00:04:58.629 out
00:05:00.030 don't

00:05:01.030 leave
00:05:01.150 anything
00:05:01.690 behind
00:05:03.449 just
00:05:04.449 kind
00:05:04.659 of
00:05:04.720 even

00:05:05.020 it
00:05:05.139 out
00:05:05.259 I
00:05:06.389 mean
00:05:07.389 admittedly
00:05:08.199 this
00:05:08.800 is
00:05:09.039 a
00:05:09.099 very

00:05:10.030 rich
00:05:10.479 dish
00:05:10.960 I'll
00:05:11.800 admit
00:05:12.190 that

00:05:12.400 but
00:05:13.090 this
00:05:13.240 is
00:05:13.360 not
00:05:13.479 the
00:05:13.569 kind
00:05:13.719 of
00:05:13.750 thing
00:05:13.930 I
00:05:14.020 eat

00:05:14.169 every
00:05:14.379 day
00:05:14.409 and
00:05:14.830 I'm
00:05:14.949 certainly
00:05:15.370 not

00:05:16.090 suggesting
00:05:16.360 how
00:05:17.110 you
00:05:17.169 eat
00:05:17.349 this
00:05:17.469 every
00:05:17.740 day

00:05:17.860 but
00:05:17.919 once
00:05:18.250 in
00:05:18.400 a
00:05:18.460 while
00:05:18.639 you
00:05:18.940 just
00:05:19.000 crave
00:05:19.599 some

00:05:20.229 comfort
00:05:20.710 food
00:05:20.979 and
00:05:21.550 this
00:05:22.270 is
00:05:22.539 perfect

00:05:23.710 I've
00:05:23.919 just
00:05:24.219 put
00:05:24.370 a
00:05:24.400 little
00:05:24.580 bit
00:05:24.729 more
00:05:24.909 sauce

00:05:25.150 over
00:05:25.539 the
00:05:25.659 top
00:05:27.090 it's
00:05:28.090 gorgeous
00:05:28.569 I
00:05:28.930 love
00:05:29.110 that

00:05:29.319 look
00:05:29.620 I
00:05:29.949 am
00:05:30.669 then
00:05:30.879 going
00:05:30.909 to
00:05:31.210 top
00:05:31.659 it
00:05:31.690 with
00:05:32.259 some

00:05:33.129 bread
00:05:33.789 crumbs
00:05:34.030 and
00:05:34.800 this
00:05:35.800 is
00:05:36.099 going
00:05:36.370 to
00:05:36.490 give

00:05:36.669 you
00:05:36.819 such
00:05:37.240 a
00:05:37.270 nice
00:05:38.039 crispy
00:05:39.039 topping
00:05:39.639 Oh

00:05:40.800 probably
00:05:41.800 my
00:05:42.099 favorite
00:05:42.550 part
00:05:42.789 of
00:05:42.969 this
00:05:43.180 dish

00:05:43.389 and
00:05:44.099 then
00:05:45.099 the
00:05:45.699 remaining
00:05:46.000 by
00:05:46.240 my
00:05:46.300 channel

00:05:46.690 just
00:05:47.440 evenly
00:05:48.009 over
