00:00:39.600 maybe
00:00:39.780 you

00:00:48.120 that's
00:00:48.270 a

00:00:48.329 good
00:00:48.450 idea

00:00:54.120 an
00:00:54.210 interesting
00:00:54.660 sweetener

00:00:55.260 and

00:00:56.129 up
00:00:56.190 for
00:00:56.430 me
00:00:56.520 you

00:01:06.210 little
00:01:06.479 bit

00:01:06.659 less

00:04:44.760 it
00:04:44.940 which
00:04:45.120 is
00:04:45.270 what
00:04:45.419 the
00:04:45.539 idea

00:04:45.870 is
00:04:45.960 and
00:04:46.500 you
00:04:46.919 get
00:04:47.039 all
00:04:47.280 the
00:04:47.460 aromatics
00:04:48.120 in

00:04:48.240 there
00:04:48.419 you
00:04:48.539 can
00:04:48.690 start
00:04:48.870 to
00:04:49.020 see
00:04:49.260 how
00:04:49.440 the

00:04:49.500 scallion
00:04:50.490 breaks
00:04:50.729 down
00:04:51.000 and
00:04:51.419 the
00:04:51.479 shallot

00:04:51.840 brings
00:04:52.080 so
00:04:52.289 much
00:04:52.440 flavor
00:04:52.800 to
00:04:53.010 it

00:04:53.340 and
00:04:53.850 we
00:04:54.690 basically
00:04:54.900 need
00:04:55.260 to
00:04:55.350 cook
00:04:55.500 this
00:04:55.710 until

00:04:55.949 the
00:04:56.160 shrimp
00:04:56.280 is
00:04:56.490 cooked
00:04:56.520 through
00:04:56.880 before
00:04:57.510 we

00:04:57.690 move
00:04:57.960 on
00:04:58.110 to
00:04:58.260 the
00:04:58.410 next
00:04:58.530 stage
00:04:59.210 and
00:05:00.210 that's
00:05:00.389 a

00:05:00.539 really
00:05:00.780 important
00:05:01.229 thing
00:05:01.260 about
00:05:01.380 wok
00:05:01.800 cooking

00:05:02.010 you
00:05:02.310 just
00:05:02.460 don't
00:05:02.639 want
00:05:02.820 to
00:05:02.940 just
00:05:03.180 cram
00:05:03.479 a
00:05:03.510 bunch

00:05:03.660 of
00:05:03.870 stuff
00:05:04.110 in
00:05:04.229 the
00:05:04.350 wok
00:05:04.560 because
00:05:05.310 otherwise
00:05:05.520 it

00:05:05.760 just
00:05:05.789 steams
00:05:06.270 before
00:05:06.690 it
00:05:06.750 gets
00:05:06.930 a
00:05:07.020 nice

00:05:07.580 coating
00:05:08.580 on
00:05:08.820 it
00:05:09.199 hey
00:05:10.199 you
00:05:10.860 stressed
00:05:11.430 that
00:05:11.550 to

00:05:11.699 me
00:05:11.789 so
00:05:11.940 much
00:05:12.120 with
00:05:12.300 wok
00:05:12.539 cooking
00:05:12.750 and
00:05:13.080 with
00:05:13.199 any

00:05:13.650 high
00:05:13.949 heat
00:05:14.190 cooking
00:05:14.370 in
00:05:14.639 general
00:05:14.669 yeah
00:05:15.360 and

00:05:15.510 you
00:05:15.570 know
00:05:15.660 what
00:05:15.780 it
00:05:15.900 was
00:05:16.110 hard
00:05:16.320 for
00:05:16.470 you
00:05:16.530 guys

00:05:16.590 to
00:05:16.740 understand
00:05:17.250 when
00:05:17.400 I
00:05:17.430 would
00:05:17.639 make
00:05:17.820 like

00:05:18.229 Thai
00:05:19.229 fried
00:05:19.500 rice
00:05:19.770 and
00:05:20.070 I'd
00:05:20.130 only
00:05:20.340 make
00:05:20.610 it
00:05:20.639 in

00:05:20.849 batches
00:05:21.060 so
00:05:21.510 that
00:05:21.630 it
00:05:21.690 was
00:05:21.810 perfect
00:05:22.229 and
00:05:22.380 we

00:05:22.530 would
00:05:22.830 never
00:05:23.160 make
00:05:23.400 him
00:05:23.580 out
00:05:23.699 he'd
00:05:23.940 never
00:05:24.120 make

00:05:24.449 enough
00:05:24.780 and
00:05:24.960 I'd
00:05:25.020 be
00:05:25.169 just
00:05:25.320 making
00:05:25.500 batches

00:05:25.830 I'd
00:05:26.190 I
00:05:26.400 wouldn't
00:05:26.729 even
00:05:26.789 get
00:05:26.940 to
00:05:27.060 a
00:05:27.090 batch
00:05:27.300 for

00:05:27.510 myself
00:05:27.870 before
00:05:28.229 one
00:05:28.680 of
00:05:28.710 the
00:05:28.979 four
00:05:29.220 of
00:05:29.310 them

00:05:29.400 would
00:05:29.580 want
00:05:29.760 another
00:05:29.820 batch
00:05:30.240 and
00:05:30.510 I
00:05:30.539 don't

00:05:30.599 blame
00:05:30.930 them
