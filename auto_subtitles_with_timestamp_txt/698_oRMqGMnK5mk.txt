00:01:21.210 splash
00:01:21.899 of
00:01:22.170 vodka
00:01:22.380 so

00:01:23.340 let's
00:01:23.610 start
00:01:24.030 by
00:01:24.390 heating
00:01:24.690 our
00:01:25.080 saute
00:01:25.649 pan

00:01:26.070 here
00:01:30.110 okay
00:01:31.110 make
00:01:31.320 sure
00:01:31.350 that
00:01:32.009 your
00:01:32.190 heat
00:01:32.490 is

00:01:32.759 really
00:01:33.300 low
00:01:33.720 because
00:01:34.560 once
00:01:34.860 you
00:01:35.100 start

00:01:35.490 working
00:01:36.420 the
00:01:36.570 milk
00:01:36.869 in
00:01:37.140 the
00:01:37.289 recipe
00:01:37.649 it
00:01:37.979 burns

00:01:38.340 very
00:01:38.520 quickly
00:01:38.990 so
00:01:39.990 I'm
00:01:40.170 going
00:01:40.590 to
00:01:40.770 add
00:01:43.430 about
00:01:44.430 2

00:01:45.000 tablespoons
00:01:45.750 of
00:01:46.080 olive
00:01:46.140 oil
00:01:46.710 here
00:01:47.750 now
00:01:48.750 the

00:01:48.810 reason
00:01:49.409 why
00:01:49.530 I
00:01:49.560 add
00:01:49.860 the
00:01:50.070 olive
00:01:50.400 oil
00:01:50.520 first
00:01:50.909 and

00:01:51.180 the
00:01:51.420 butter
00:01:51.720 next
00:01:52.619 because
00:01:53.009 if
00:01:53.280 you
00:01:53.400 add
00:01:53.580 the

00:01:53.759 butter
00:01:54.030 force
00:01:54.479 it's
00:01:54.689 going
00:01:54.930 to
00:01:55.049 burn
00:01:55.320 so
00:01:55.619 it's

00:01:55.830 going
00:01:55.979 to
00:01:56.100 give
00:01:56.280 that
00:01:56.460 surely
00:01:56.970 burnt
00:01:57.240 effect

00:01:57.689 which
00:01:57.869 you
00:01:57.900 don't
00:01:58.229 want
00:01:58.580 so
00:01:59.580 now
00:01:59.759 when
00:01:59.970 it

00:02:00.119 heats
00:02:00.420 up
00:02:00.630 slightly
00:02:01.020 I'm
00:02:01.549 going
00:02:02.549 to
00:02:02.820 add
00:02:03.060 in

00:02:03.299 the
00:02:03.330 butter
00:02:06.229 so
00:02:07.229 the
00:02:07.350 butter
00:02:07.619 really
00:02:08.040 gives
00:02:08.280 us

00:02:08.459 really
00:02:08.700 creamy
00:02:09.299 creamy
00:02:10.079 texture
00:02:10.560 to
00:02:10.860 the

00:02:10.950 pasta
00:02:11.430 so
00:02:12.269 that
00:02:12.420 is
00:02:12.570 the
00:02:12.690 reason
00:02:12.840 why
00:02:13.230 we
00:02:13.410 add

00:02:13.590 butter
00:02:13.829 as
00:02:14.130 well
00:02:14.540 so
00:02:15.540 just
00:02:15.570 let
00:02:15.989 it
00:02:16.019 melt

00:02:16.470 slightly
00:02:17.720 now
00:02:18.720 what
00:02:18.900 I'm
00:02:19.019 doing
00:02:19.049 here
00:02:19.650 is
00:02:19.709 I'm

00:02:19.890 actually
00:02:20.370 mixing
00:02:21.180 the
00:02:21.420 vegetable
00:02:21.989 sauce

00:02:22.290 which
00:02:22.620 is
00:02:22.769 the
00:02:22.920 white
00:02:23.190 cheese
00:02:23.610 sauce
00:02:23.880 and
00:02:24.150 I'm

00:02:24.480 mixing
00:02:24.720 the
00:02:25.049 marinara
00:02:25.530 sauce
00:02:25.769 so
00:02:26.190 it
00:02:26.370 gives
00:02:26.700 a

00:02:26.910 really
00:02:27.299 creamy
00:02:27.810 and

00:02:28.580 gangee
00:02:29.000 effect
00:02:29.420 to
00:02:29.510 the
00:02:29.630 pasta
00:02:30.080 all
00:02:30.260 in
00:02:30.680 one

00:02:30.920 shot
00:02:31.220 so
00:02:32.260 my
00:02:33.260 butter
00:02:33.560 and
00:02:33.740 olive
00:02:34.100 oil
00:02:34.400 have

00:02:34.760 melted
00:02:35.270 now
00:02:35.510 so
00:02:36.380 I
00:02:36.410 am
00:02:36.590 just
00:02:36.980 going
00:02:37.220 to
00:02:37.370 add
00:02:38.080 the

00:02:39.080 1
00:02:39.320 tablespoon
00:02:40.070 of
00:02:40.250 all-purpose
00:02:40.760 flour
00:02:41.270 in

00:02:41.810 this
00:02:43.270 and
00:02:45.100 at
00:02:46.100 this
00:02:46.310 point
00:02:46.610 just
00:02:46.850 whisk
00:02:47.360 it

00:02:47.660 nicely
00:02:48.560 so
00:02:49.310 we
00:02:49.340 are
00:02:49.550 cooking
00:02:49.760 the
00:02:50.060 flour

00:02:50.300 slightly
00:02:50.990 for
00:02:51.170 a
00:02:51.200 minute
00:02:51.560 or
00:02:51.710 two
00:02:51.740 just
00:02:52.250 to

00:02:52.880 remove
00:02:53.270 the
00:02:53.570 rawness
00:02:54.020 and
00:02:54.230 to
00:02:54.740 give
00:02:54.920 it
00:02:55.100 that

00:02:55.130 thick
00:02:55.520 texture
00:02:56.000 in
00:02:56.270 the
00:02:56.360 cheese
00:02:56.600 sauce
00:02:56.840 that

00:02:57.080 we
00:02:57.230 want
00:02:57.470 so
00:02:58.400 this
00:02:58.550 is
00:02:58.760 your
00:02:58.910 classic

00:02:59.270 vegetable
00:03:00.260 or
00:03:00.620 white
00:03:00.950 sauce
00:03:01.250 as
00:03:01.520 Italy
00:03:04.780 so
00:03:05.780 now

00:03:05.900 I've
00:03:06.020 made
00:03:06.200 this
00:03:06.590 really
00:03:06.980 nice
00:03:07.459 paste
00:03:08.090 of
00:03:08.540 the

00:03:09.200 flour
00:03:09.530 and
00:03:09.890 the
00:03:10.040 butter
00:03:10.220 and
00:03:10.730 the
00:03:10.910 olive
00:03:11.060 oil

00:03:11.360 so
00:03:14.110 now
00:03:15.110 I'm
00:03:15.470 adding
00:03:15.709 about
00:03:16.310 a
00:03:16.580 cup
00:03:16.880 and
00:03:17.000 a
00:03:17.090 half

00:03:17.120 of
00:03:17.600 whole
00:03:18.110 milk
00:03:18.140 in
00:03:18.770 this
00:03:18.980 so
00:03:19.760 just
00:03:19.940 add
00:03:20.240 it
00:03:20.480 and

00:03:20.630 while
00:03:20.930 you're
00:03:21.140 adding
00:03:21.380 just
00:03:22.160 stir
00:03:22.580 and
00:03:22.820 whisk

00:03:23.120 so
00:03:23.540 that
00:03:23.690 no
00:03:23.870 lumps
00:03:24.200 are
00:03:24.500 formed
00:03:24.530 so
00:03:27.010 just
00:03:28.010 add

00:03:28.280 all
00:03:28.640 that

00:03:32.239 and
00:03:32.750 keep
00:03:33.049 on
00:03:33.230 whisking
00:03:33.980 so
00:03:34.129 that
00:03:34.280 no
00:03:34.519 lumps

00:03:34.819 are
00:03:35.090 formed
00:03:35.120 so
00:03:39.640 the
00:03:40.640 whole
00:03:40.849 idea
00:03:41.299 is
00:03:41.329 to

00:03:41.390 thicken
00:03:41.840 the
00:03:42.140 sauce
00:03:42.379 slightly
00:03:43.069 so
00:03:43.760 that
00:03:43.909 when

00:03:44.150 we
00:03:44.269 add
00:03:44.420 the
