00:01:24.090 get
00:01:24.300 this

00:01:28.760 it's
00:01:29.720 that
00:01:29.960 simple

00:03:29.700 six
00:03:29.910 seven

00:03:30.090 eight
00:03:30.300 problems
00:03:31.080 this
00:03:31.500 is
00:03:31.560 not
00:03:31.980 considered

00:03:32.460 boiling
00:03:33.060 I
00:03:33.270 think
00:03:33.870 this
00:03:34.020 is
00:03:34.170 ready
00:03:34.350 though

00:03:38.569 I
00:03:38.599 can
00:03:39.349 start
00:03:39.620 making
00:03:39.799 with
00:03:40.040 a
00:03:40.129 soup
00:03:40.340 base
00:03:40.549 so

00:03:41.090 what
00:03:41.659 I
00:03:41.689 like
00:03:41.870 to
00:03:41.959 do
00:03:42.079 is
00:03:42.170 I
00:03:42.319 don't
00:03:42.379 like
00:03:42.620 to
00:03:42.769 use

00:03:42.890 the
00:03:43.040 same
00:03:43.250 water
00:03:43.640 that's
00:03:44.209 easier
00:03:44.750 to
00:03:44.780 boil
00:03:45.260 the

00:03:45.409 soup
00:03:45.590 base
00:03:45.769 because
00:03:46.189 the

00:03:46.879 have
00:03:47.090 like

00:03:47.299 flour
00:03:47.659 and
00:03:47.870 stuff
00:03:48.379 on
00:03:48.590 them
00:03:48.829 so
00:03:49.340 what
00:03:49.489 I
00:03:49.549 like

00:03:49.730 to

00:03:50.180 boil
00:03:50.450 separate
00:03:51.019 broth
00:03:51.379 so

00:03:51.890 can

00:03:52.189 get
00:03:52.310 a
00:03:52.340 nice
00:03:52.519 clear

00:03:55.879 can

00:03:56.000 always
00:03:56.090 as
00:03:56.299 well
00:03:56.510 in
00:03:56.689 another

00:03:57.349 I
00:04:10.629 put
00:04:11.629 the

00:04:11.750 rest
00:04:11.930 in
00:04:12.170 the
00:04:12.260 refrigerator
00:04:12.379 here
00:04:13.150 the
00:04:14.150 wire

00:04:14.359 looks
00:04:14.629 like
00:04:14.780 it's

00:04:22.580 this
00:04:22.699 is
00:04:22.880 important
00:04:23.449 right

00:04:25.940 or
00:04:26.060 else
00:04:26.150 you

00:04:26.479 don't
00:04:26.570 want
00:04:26.780 the

00:04:27.500 to
00:04:27.620 the

00:04:27.710 bottom
00:04:27.919 so
00:04:28.639 the
00:04:28.759 Broncos
00:04:29.240 will
00:04:29.360 be
