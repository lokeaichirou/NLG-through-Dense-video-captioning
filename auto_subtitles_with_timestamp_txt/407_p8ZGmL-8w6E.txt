00:01:04.150 is
00:01:04.390 two

00:02:46.709 tried
00:02:47.040 it
00:02:47.160 with
00:02:47.459 any

00:02:47.670 other
00:02:47.760 combinations
00:02:48.630 besides
00:02:49.170 the
00:02:49.560 parsley

00:02:49.980 and
00:02:50.220 mint
00:02:50.850 so
00:02:51.330 I'm
00:02:51.480 not
00:02:51.660 sure
00:02:51.890 how
00:02:52.890 it
00:02:53.070 would

00:02:53.190 taste
00:02:53.400 if
00:02:53.640 you
00:02:53.760 were
00:02:53.850 to
00:02:53.910 substitute
00:02:54.150 any
00:02:54.720 of

00:02:54.930 the
00:02:55.050 two
00:02:55.290 now
00:02:56.130 when
00:02:56.340 I
00:02:56.370 had
00:02:56.700 this
00:02:56.940 it
00:02:57.480 did
00:02:57.780 have

00:02:58.050 a
00:02:58.080 lot
00:02:58.590 of
00:02:58.830 mint
00:02:59.160 in
00:02:59.430 it
00:02:59.640 which
00:02:59.790 I
00:02:59.940 thought
00:03:00.120 was

00:03:00.269 a
00:03:00.330 little
00:03:00.420 overpowering
00:03:01.610 so
00:03:02.610 I
00:03:02.640 cut
00:03:03.090 it
00:03:03.209 down

00:03:03.239 to
00:03:03.570 only
00:03:03.750 two
00:03:03.959 tablespoons
00:03:04.620 of
00:03:04.769 mint
00:03:05.040 and
00:03:05.250 one

00:03:05.910 large
00:03:06.180 bunch
00:03:06.540 of
00:03:06.810 parsley
00:03:07.310 so
00:03:08.310 I'm
00:03:08.370 just
00:03:08.489 going

00:03:08.610 to
00:03:08.670 finish
00:03:08.880 mincing
00:03:09.390 this
00:03:09.540 up
00:03:11.959 that
00:03:12.959 looks

00:03:13.170 fantastic
00:03:14.450 putting
00:03:15.450 that
00:03:15.600 right
00:03:16.019 into
00:03:16.530 my

00:03:16.650 large
00:03:16.860 bowl
00:03:18.739 along
00:03:19.739 with
00:03:19.890 the
00:03:19.980 cherry

00:03:20.190 tomatoes
00:03:20.340 that
00:03:20.730 I
00:03:20.760 have
00:03:21.120 I
00:03:21.630 don't
00:03:22.019 like
00:03:22.140 a
00:03:22.170 lot

00:03:22.350 of
00:03:22.410 cherry
00:03:22.709 tomatoes
00:03:22.890 because
00:03:23.430 I
00:03:23.459 feel
00:03:23.610 like

00:03:23.640 they
00:03:23.880 can
00:03:24.000 become
00:03:24.420 a
00:03:24.450 little
00:03:24.840 watery
00:03:25.200 and
00:03:25.890 I

00:03:25.950 don't
00:03:26.160 like
00:03:26.310 that
00:03:26.540 so
00:03:27.540 I'm
00:03:27.600 gonna
00:03:27.690 take
00:03:27.900 my

00:03:27.959 scallions
00:03:28.650 and
00:03:29.269 just
00:03:30.860 mince
00:03:31.860 these
00:03:32.130 or
00:03:32.340 chop

00:03:32.579 them
00:03:32.820 just
00:03:33.570 nice
00:03:33.750 and
00:03:34.019 small
00:03:34.290 I
00:03:34.560 want

00:03:34.920 everything
00:03:35.100 to
00:03:35.280 be
00:03:35.400 like
00:03:35.760 little
00:03:36.750 tiny
00:03:36.870 pieces

00:03:39.739 gallons
00:03:40.739 go
00:03:41.010 right
00:03:41.489 in
00:03:43.100 next
00:03:44.100 is
00:03:44.250 the
00:03:44.430 cucumber

00:03:44.640 none
00:03:45.090 of
00:03:45.180 these
00:03:45.269 this
00:03:45.840 cucumber
00:03:46.260 that
00:03:46.290 I'm

00:03:46.500 using
00:03:46.680 is
00:03:46.950 called
00:03:47.220 a
00:03:47.310 seedless
00:03:47.700 cucumber
00:03:47.730 but

00:03:48.269 as
00:03:48.390 you
00:03:48.540 can
00:03:48.630 see
00:03:48.690 there's
00:03:49.049 seeds
00:03:49.290 in
00:03:49.500 there
00:03:49.680 so

00:03:50.160 I
00:03:50.190 want
00:03:50.459 to
00:03:50.489 remove
00:03:50.850 those
00:03:51.150 because
00:03:51.660 again

00:03:51.959 they
00:03:52.290 can
00:03:52.470 make
00:03:52.620 the
00:03:53.250 salad
00:03:53.790 really
00:03:54.060 watery

00:03:55.310 because
00:03:56.310 they
00:03:56.519 are
00:03:56.579 full
00:03:57.030 of
00:03:57.329 water
00:03:57.570 so
00:03:58.130 get

00:03:59.130 rid
00:03:59.280 of
00:03:59.340 the
00:03:59.430 seeds
00:03:59.760 I
00:03:59.940 don't
00:04:00.150 suggest
00:04:00.269 doing

00:04:00.630 it
00:04:00.840 this
00:04:00.930 way
00:04:00.989 I
00:04:01.170 suggest
00:04:01.440 you
00:04:02.220 take
00:04:02.370 a
00:04:02.430 spoon

00:04:02.820 and
00:04:03.120 just
00:04:03.709 take
00:04:04.709 them
00:04:04.829 out
00:04:04.950 this
00:04:05.130 way
00:04:05.190 much

00:04:05.850 much
00:04:06.090 safer
00:04:06.359 sane
00:04:06.959 and
00:04:09.230 smells
00:04:10.230 really
00:04:10.440 good

00:04:10.650 though
00:04:10.799 they
00:04:10.920 smell
00:04:11.190 super
00:04:11.609 super
00:04:11.880 fresh
00:04:12.799 rich

00:04:13.799 so
00:04:14.700 it's
00:04:14.880 a
00:04:14.910 good
00:04:15.030 thing
00:04:15.090 and
00:04:15.450 then
00:04:15.989 I'm
00:04:16.109 just

00:04:16.140 going
00:04:16.440 to
00:04:16.620 cut
00:04:16.799 these
00:04:16.979 into
00:04:17.250 matchstick

00:04:17.850 pieces
00:04:18.359 like
00:04:18.600 this
00:04:19.100 like
00:04:20.100 little
00:04:20.250 sticks
00:04:21.239 and

00:04:21.650 then
00:04:22.650 run

00:04:31.930 chopped
00:04:32.260 and
00:04:32.470 ready
00:04:32.610 but
00:04:33.610 I

00:04:33.639 didn't
00:04:33.940 want

00:05:58.690 together
00:05:58.900 and

00:05:59.490 I'm
00:06:00.490 just
00:06:00.520 going
00:06:00.789 to
00:06:00.850 set
00:06:01.030 this
00:06:01.180 aside
00:06:01.240 and

00:06:01.900 wait
00:06:02.889 until
00:06:03.550 my
00:06:03.760 bulgur
00:06:04.120 wheat
00:06:04.240 has
00:06:04.600 cooked

00:06:04.960 and
00:06:05.169 then
00:06:05.440 we
00:06:05.560 are
00:06:05.680 going
00:06:05.800 to
00:06:05.860 finish
00:06:06.010 the

00:06:06.280 entire
00:06:06.639 thing
00:06:06.970 up
00:06:07.150 together

00:06:08.310 my
00:06:09.310 bulgur
00:06:09.820 wheat
00:06:09.940 cooked
00:06:10.270 for
00:06:10.630 about
00:06:10.750 15

00:06:11.380 minutes
00:06:11.620 it's
00:06:11.979 so
00:06:12.430 delicious
00:06:13.120 and
00:06:13.360 perfectly

00:06:13.960 cooked
00:06:14.200 and
00:06:14.440 not
00:06:14.860 watery
00:06:15.430 at
00:06:15.669 all
00:06:16.180 because
00:06:16.510 we

00:06:16.780 only
00:06:16.990 used
00:06:17.380 a
00:06:17.620 cup
00:06:18.010 and
00:06:18.130 a
00:06:18.190 half
00:06:18.220 water
00:06:18.700 rather

00:06:19.690 than
00:06:19.870 using
00:06:20.320 the
00:06:20.440 recommended
00:06:20.590 two
00:06:21.190 cups

00:06:21.460 because
00:06:21.820 it
00:06:21.940 would
00:06:22.060 make
00:06:22.180 it
00:06:22.360 really
00:06:22.510 watery

00:06:22.900 so
00:06:23.800 you
00:06:24.130 always
00:06:24.310 want
00:06:24.550 to
00:06:24.610 use
00:06:24.880 a
00:06:25.240 fork
00:06:25.720 to

00:06:26.260 fluff
00:06:26.530 it
00:06:26.620 up
00:06:26.740 just
00:06:27.100 like
00:06:27.220 you
00:06:27.400 would
00:06:27.580 with

00:06:27.610 rice
00:06:28.030 you
00:06:28.720 just
00:06:28.900 want
00:06:29.020 to
00:06:29.050 make
00:06:29.200 sure
00:06:29.229 you

00:06:29.500 don't
00:06:29.740 scratch
