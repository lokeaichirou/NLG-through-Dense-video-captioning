00:02:23.879 bit
00:02:24.090 of
00:02:24.180 salt

00:02:24.920 but
00:02:25.920 that's
00:02:26.459 different
00:02:26.790 for
00:02:26.970 everyone
00:02:27.269 so
00:02:27.660 you

00:02:28.140 just
00:02:28.440 do
00:02:28.650 however
00:02:29.010 much
00:02:29.370 you
00:02:29.549 like
00:02:29.700 just

00:02:29.940 remember
00:02:30.269 that
00:02:30.390 you
00:02:30.450 could
00:02:30.599 always
00:02:30.840 add
00:02:31.140 more

00:02:31.379 but
00:02:31.530 you
00:02:31.620 can't
00:02:31.860 take
00:02:32.069 any
00:02:32.250 up
00:02:32.400 so
00:02:32.580 maybe
00:02:32.730 don't

00:02:32.940 be
00:02:33.060 too
00:02:33.599 heavy-handed
00:02:33.900 if
00:02:34.319 you're
00:02:34.440 not
00:02:34.590 sure

00:02:34.860 on
00:02:35.129 what
00:02:35.190 your
00:02:35.760 preference
00:02:36.150 is
00:02:36.329 yet
00:02:37.010 and
00:02:38.010 just

00:02:38.040 mix
00:02:38.790 mix
00:02:39.150 mix
00:02:39.560 so
00:02:40.560 it's
00:02:40.680 starting
00:02:41.010 to
00:02:41.099 get
00:02:41.160 nice

00:02:41.370 and
00:02:41.400 light
00:02:41.700 and
00:02:41.730 fluffy
00:02:41.879 so
00:02:42.510 we
00:02:42.629 can
00:02:42.780 add
00:02:42.989 in

00:02:43.170 the
00:02:43.200 milk
00:02:43.440 now
00:02:43.920 a
00:02:43.950 note
00:02:44.250 about
00:02:44.489 milk
00:02:44.730 you
00:02:44.910 want

00:02:45.060 to
00:02:45.150 make
00:02:45.269 sure
00:02:45.510 that
00:02:45.660 you
00:02:45.780 use
00:02:46.970 not
00:02:47.970 cold
00:02:48.390 milk

00:02:48.599 if
00:02:48.870 you
00:02:49.110 can
00:02:49.410 use
00:02:49.530 at
00:02:49.829 least
00:02:49.980 room
00:02:50.250 temperature

00:02:50.640 or
00:02:50.819 warms
00:02:51.239 milk
00:02:51.510 that's
00:02:51.720 better

00:02:52.170 if
00:02:52.769 you
00:02:52.920 use
00:02:53.040 cold
00:02:53.370 milk
00:02:53.489 it
00:02:53.819 will
00:02:53.970 react
00:02:54.269 with

00:02:54.450 the
00:02:54.569 starch
