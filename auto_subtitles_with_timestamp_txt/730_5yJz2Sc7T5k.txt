00:00:01.469 delight

00:00:02.010 that
00:00:02.250 is
00:00:02.340 surprisingly
00:00:03.030 simple
00:00:03.300 to
00:00:03.570 make

00:00:03.750 let's

00:00:14.880 and
00:00:15.030 pepper
00:00:15.059 squid
00:00:15.420 first
00:00:16.199 I've
00:00:16.440 got
00:00:16.800 four

00:00:17.400 large
00:00:18.060 squid
00:00:18.900 tubes
00:00:19.289 also
00:00:19.710 known
00:00:20.130 as
00:00:20.460 squid

00:00:21.000 hoods
00:00:21.270 and
00:00:21.510 we're
00:00:22.230 just

00:00:23.310 along
00:00:24.000 one
00:00:24.539 side
00:00:25.640 to
00:00:26.640 open
00:00:27.630 it
00:00:27.720 up
00:00:27.810 and
00:00:28.130 using
00:00:29.130 a

00:00:29.189 sharp
00:00:29.220 knife
00:00:29.519 we're
00:00:30.300 just
00:00:30.510 going
00:00:30.660 to
00:00:30.750 cut

00:00:31.130 little
00:00:32.450 diagonal
00:00:33.450 lines
00:00:33.710 along
00:00:34.710 the
00:00:34.890 inside

00:00:35.250 surface
00:00:35.790 you
00:00:35.910 don't
00:00:36.030 need
00:00:36.210 to
00:00:36.300 cut
00:00:36.510 all
00:00:36.750 the

00:00:36.870 way
00:00:36.989 through
00:00:37.040 just
00:00:38.040 score
00:00:38.610 those
00:00:39.090 marks
00:00:39.660 all

00:00:39.899 on
00:00:40.500 the
00:00:40.620 inside
00:00:41.690 Pat
00:00:42.690 that
00:00:42.960 dry
00:00:43.320 with
00:00:43.770 a
00:00:43.800 bit
00:00:44.010 of

00:00:44.129 paper
00:00:44.640 towel
00:00:45.090 just
00:00:45.390 to
00:00:46.230 get
00:00:46.350 any
00:00:46.469 excess

00:00:46.890 liquid
00:00:46.920 off
00:00:47.399 and
00:00:47.879 simply
00:00:48.180 slice
00:00:48.870 the
00:00:49.110 squid
00:00:49.410 up

00:00:49.559 into
00:00:50.280 small
00:00:50.850 pieces

00:00:55.370 that's
00:00:56.370 our
00:00:56.550 squid
00:00:56.789 chopped
00:00:57.059 up
00:00:57.239 so
00:00:57.420 we
00:00:57.510 can

00:00:57.629 just
00:00:57.780 set
00:00:57.930 that
00:00:58.050 aside
00:00:58.109 while
00:00:58.530 we
00:00:58.680 work
00:00:58.859 on
00:00:59.039 our

00:00:59.250 coating
00:00:59.660 next

00:01:01.710 lock

00:01:01.949 freezer
00:01:02.460 bag
00:01:02.850 now
00:01:03.359 this
00:01:03.539 makes
00:01:03.809 things
00:01:04.049 so

00:01:04.470 much
00:01:04.650 easier
00:01:04.710 when
00:01:05.100 it
00:01:05.220 comes
00:01:05.400 to
00:01:05.580 crumbing

00:01:06.150 things
00:01:06.479 I'm

00:01:13.890 or
00:01:13.950 cornstarch

00:01:14.600 this
00:01:15.600 helps
00:01:15.930 to
00:01:16.110 add
00:01:16.320 a
00:01:16.380 nice

00:02:13.110 piece
00:02:13.319 of
00:02:13.500 bread
00:02:13.709 dropped

00:02:18.239 gently
00:02:18.510 place

00:02:30.060 minutes
00:02:30.299 or
00:02:30.720 until
00:02:30.840 they

00:02:31.890 go

00:02:31.980 nice
00:02:32.250 and
00:02:32.280 golden
00:02:32.880 try
00:02:33.269 not
00:02:33.450 to
00:02:33.480 overcook
00:02:33.900 them

00:02:34.080 because
00:02:34.350 otherwise
00:02:34.590 they'll
00:02:34.890 go
00:02:35.010 kind
00:02:35.280 of

00:02:35.370 rubbery
00:02:35.670 humans
00:02:36.569 later
00:02:36.810 and
00:02:37.019 our
00:02:37.110 squid
00:02:37.470 is

00:02:37.590 lovely
00:02:38.010 and

00:02:40.019 and

00:02:40.230 looking
00:02:40.650 gorgeous
00:02:40.920 so
00:02:41.370 we
00:02:41.489 just
00:02:41.730 take
00:02:42.239 that

00:02:43.230 and
00:02:43.560 transfer
00:02:44.040 it

00:02:44.130 onto
00:02:44.280 a

00:02:49.620 any
00:02:49.799 excess
00:02:50.190 oil

00:02:50.459 and
00:02:50.700 then
00:02:51.299 we'll
00:02:51.450 allow
00:02:51.780 this
00:02:51.989 oil
00:02:52.290 to
00:02:52.530 come

00:02:52.739 back
00:02:52.950 to

00:03:02.100 of
00:03:02.220 course
00:03:02.400 you
