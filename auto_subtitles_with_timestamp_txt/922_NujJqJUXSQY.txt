00:01:41.960 see
00:01:42.290 we
00:01:43.220 want
00:01:43.400 to
00:01:43.460 use
00:01:43.580 a

00:01:43.610 wooden
00:01:43.850 spoon
00:01:44.120 as
00:01:44.390 well
00:01:44.540 because
00:01:44.780 we

00:01:45.380 there
00:01:45.710 the
00:01:46.550 fine
00:01:46.730 pan

00:01:46.940 otherwise
00:01:47.060 it
00:01:47.360 won't
00:01:47.540 be
00:01:47.660 stiff
00:01:48.020 nonstick

00:01:48.440 anymore
00:01:48.760 if
00:01:49.760 you
00:01:50.000 come
00:01:50.240 in
00:01:50.390 and
00:01:50.510 have
00:01:50.660 a
00:01:50.690 look

00:01:50.900 because
00:01:51.710 we've
00:01:52.100 preheated
00:01:52.430 the
00:01:52.790 pan
00:01:53.150 the

00:01:53.900 cooking
00:01:54.260 process
00:01:54.440 starts
00:01:55.160 automatically

00:01:55.850 straightaway
00:01:56.480 so
00:01:57.380 once
00:01:57.650 you
00:01:57.920 keep
00:01:58.160 the
00:01:58.430 eggs

00:01:58.580 moving
00:01:59.090 that's
00:01:59.330 all
00:01:59.540 you
00:01:59.660 need
00:01:59.810 to
00:01:59.930 do
00:02:00.050 is
00:02:00.140 just

00:02:00.320 keep
00:02:00.560 them
00:02:00.770 moving
00:02:00.920 around
00:02:01.250 the
00:02:01.520 pan
00:02:02.020 around

00:02:03.020 and
00:02:03.200 around
00:02:03.290 don't
00:02:03.740 leave
00:02:04.010 it
00:02:04.570 keep
00:02:05.570 them

00:02:05.720 moving
00:02:05.960 because
00:02:06.620 otherwise
00:02:06.950 they'll
00:02:07.250 just

00:02:07.400 end
00:02:07.490 up
00:02:07.700 in
00:02:07.850 a
00:02:08.020 omelet
00:02:09.020 and
00:02:09.259 that's
00:02:09.770 not
00:02:09.950 what

00:02:10.130 this
00:02:10.250 recipes
00:02:12.820 we
00:02:13.820 don't
00:02:14.060 want
00:02:14.240 to
00:02:14.300 cook
00:02:14.480 them

00:02:14.660 all
00:02:14.870 the
00:02:15.050 way
00:02:15.170 because
00:02:15.740 we're
00:02:16.280 gonna
00:02:16.400 leave

00:02:16.640 them
00:02:16.880 to
00:02:17.060 rest
00:02:17.440 so
00:02:18.440 you'll
00:02:18.590 see
00:02:18.830 here
00:02:19.010 that

00:02:19.070 this
00:02:19.310 looks
00:02:19.550 quite
00:02:19.850 running
00:02:20.300 still
00:02:20.630 but
00:02:21.590 I'm

00:02:21.709 gonna
00:02:21.860 flatten
00:02:22.520 it
00:02:22.700 out
00:02:22.850 over
00:02:23.570 the
00:02:23.660 pan
00:02:23.870 and

00:02:24.080 while
00:02:24.230 I
00:02:24.260 bottom
00:02:24.590 my
00:02:24.709 toast
00:02:25.160 and
00:02:25.400 then
00:02:26.060 you'll

00:02:26.180 see
00:02:26.450 when
00:02:26.660 we
00:02:26.780 come
00:02:26.990 back
00:02:27.110 to
00:02:27.290 there
00:02:27.500 that
00:02:27.740 will

00:02:27.830 be
00:02:27.920 perfectly
00:02:28.730 cooked
00:02:29.920 so
00:02:30.920 just
00:02:31.190 get
00:02:31.310 some
00:02:32.830 on

00:02:33.830 the
00:02:33.980 toast

00:02:34.580 now
00:02:34.760 I
00:02:34.790 like
00:02:35.180 butter
00:02:35.510 as
00:02:36.070 you
00:02:37.070 can
00:02:37.250 probably

00:02:37.430 tell
00:02:38.110 but
00:02:39.110 if
00:02:39.230 you
00:02:39.380 don't
00:02:39.620 you
00:02:40.220 don't
00:02:40.340 have
00:02:40.459 to

00:02:40.730 use
00:02:40.940 it
00:02:41.150 you
00:02:41.270 can
00:02:41.330 use
00:02:41.480 a
00:02:41.600 drizzle
00:02:41.989 of
00:02:42.050 olive

00:02:42.230 oil
00:02:42.500 or
00:02:42.800 nothing
00:02:43.450 but
00:02:44.450 it's
00:02:45.320 alright
00:02:45.530 to

00:02:45.709 splurge
00:02:45.980 a
00:02:46.190 little
00:02:46.220 bit
00:02:46.810 now
00:02:47.810 let's
00:02:47.959 go
00:02:48.080 back

00:02:48.230 to
00:02:48.380 the
00:02:48.500 eggs
00:02:49.660 you
00:02:50.660 can
00:02:50.810 see
00:02:51.080 now
00:02:51.290 look
00:02:51.530 the

00:02:52.040 residual
00:02:52.580 heat
00:02:52.820 from
00:02:52.850 that
00:02:53.239 pan
00:02:53.709 has
00:02:54.709 put
00:02:55.010 them

00:02:57.320 so
00:02:58.340 because
00:02:59.340 they've
00:02:59.550 set
00:03:00.140 they're
00:03:01.140 a
00:03:01.170 bit

00:03:01.350 lumpy
00:03:01.560 so
00:03:01.950 I'm
00:03:02.010 just
00:03:02.190 gonna
00:03:02.310 chop
00:03:02.670 them
00:03:03.300 up
00:03:03.330 a

00:03:03.450 little
00:03:03.540 bit
00:03:04.160 and
00:03:05.160 then
00:03:05.820 this
00:03:06.780 is

00:03:07.170 two

00:03:07.320 people
00:03:08.120 six
00:03:09.120 six
00:03:09.360 so
00:03:09.990 we'll
00:03:10.200 just
00:03:10.320 take
00:03:10.530 half
00:03:10.770 I

00:03:11.510 just
