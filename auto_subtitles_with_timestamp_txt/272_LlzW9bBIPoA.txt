00:00:04.149 beef
00:00:05.149 bourguignon
00:00:05.840 a
00:00:05.990 classic
00:00:06.589 dish
00:00:06.800 but
00:00:07.670 I've

00:00:07.849 got
00:00:08.149 a
00:00:08.179 little
00:00:08.660 twist
00:00:08.929 on
00:00:09.110 it
00:00:09.170 that
00:00:09.679 always

00:00:10.099 proved
00:00:10.490 to
00:00:10.670 be
00:00:10.700 a
00:00:10.820 hit
00:00:11.059 to
00:00:11.210 my
00:00:11.360 pity
00:00:11.630 Parisian

00:00:12.170 restaurant
00:00:12.710 and
00:00:13.010 for
00:00:13.849 my
00:00:14.059 version
00:00:14.420 I'm
00:00:15.110 going

00:00:15.500 to
00:00:15.650 need
00:00:15.800 that
00:00:15.950 stale
00:00:16.340 old
00:00:16.670 baguette
00:00:17.800 start

00:00:18.800 off
00:00:19.009 by
00:00:19.189 coating
00:00:19.460 the
00:00:19.669 beef
00:00:19.849 and
00:00:20.089 flour
00:00:20.300 so

00:00:21.259 it's
00:00:21.529 worth
00:00:22.839 wearing
00:00:23.839 the
00:00:24.019 wrong
00:00:24.140 dress

00:00:24.939 getting
00:00:25.939 dusted
00:00:26.480 I'm
00:00:26.689 dusting
00:00:27.230 myself
00:00:27.589 right

00:00:27.859 now
00:00:27.890 the
00:00:28.819 flour
00:00:29.089 will
00:00:29.449 thicken
00:00:29.479 the
00:00:30.050 stew

00:00:30.109 later
00:00:31.090 I'm
00:00:32.090 using
00:00:32.540 beef
00:00:33.350 Shin
00:00:33.649 very
00:00:34.370 big

00:00:34.610 chunks
00:00:35.120 I
00:00:35.390 prefer
00:00:35.960 doing
00:00:36.200 big
00:00:36.440 chunks
00:00:36.890 takes
00:00:37.250 a

00:00:37.370 little
00:00:37.550 bit
00:00:37.730 longer
00:00:37.910 but
00:00:38.480 it's
00:00:38.630 better
00:00:38.870 than

00:00:39.050 all
00:00:39.230 those
00:00:39.470 little
00:00:39.890 chunks
00:00:41.110 okay

00:00:42.470 then
00:00:42.950 sear
00:00:43.280 the
00:00:43.460 beef
00:00:43.490 it
00:00:44.030 will
00:00:44.210 bring
00:00:44.420 out
00:00:44.510 the

00:00:44.690 sugars
00:00:44.990 in
00:00:45.170 the
00:00:45.260 meat
00:00:45.440 and
00:00:45.650 make
00:00:45.890 it
00:00:46.070 more

00:00:46.220 flavor
00:00:46.550 some
00:00:46.900 lovely
00:00:47.900 golden
00:00:48.500 color
00:00:48.560 when
00:00:49.310 it

00:00:49.430 caramelized
00:00:50.090 on
00:00:50.390 one
00:00:50.570 side
00:00:50.870 just
00:00:51.370 turn
00:00:52.370 it

00:00:52.580 over
00:00:52.730 almost
00:00:53.540 oh
00:00:53.990 that
00:00:54.710 looks
00:00:54.890 good

00:00:56.110 remove
00:00:57.110 the
00:00:57.290 meat
00:00:57.470 but
00:00:57.800 keep
00:00:58.040 the
00:00:58.160 oil
00:00:58.310 then

00:00:58.820 add
00:00:58.850 150
00:00:59.840 grams

00:01:12.259 little
00:01:12.439 black
00:01:13.249 bits
00:01:13.520 at
00:01:13.700 the
00:01:13.729 bottom
00:01:13.819 actually

00:01:14.659 makes
00:01:15.079 us
00:01:15.289 to
00:01:15.499 take
00:01:15.770 bit
00:01:16.009 better
00:01:16.310 so

00:03:31.130 last
00:03:31.310 minute
00:03:31.580 to
00:03:31.940 stop
00:03:32.180 them
00:03:32.390 getting
00:03:32.570 soggy

00:03:33.290 the
00:03:34.130 French
