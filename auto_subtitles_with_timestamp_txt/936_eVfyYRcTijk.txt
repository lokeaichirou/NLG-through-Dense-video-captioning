00:05:11.270 risk

00:05:11.390 my
00:05:11.480 fingers
00:05:11.930 start
00:05:12.500 a
00:05:12.590 new

00:05:17.570 right
00:05:17.600 there

00:05:20.630 of
00:05:20.720 that
00:05:20.750 starch
00:05:21.140 so
00:05:21.500 they
00:05:21.620 don't
00:05:21.770 stick

00:05:22.010 together
00:05:22.130 as
00:05:22.490 they

00:05:27.320 want
00:05:27.590 to

00:06:54.640 and
00:06:54.820 the

00:06:55.450 carbonation
00:06:56.020 is
00:06:56.140 really
00:06:56.350 just
00:06:56.500 going
00:06:56.590 to

00:06:56.680 lighten
00:06:56.979 the
00:06:57.039 batter

00:07:02.110 add
00:07:02.200 a
00:07:02.410 little
00:07:02.830 bit

00:07:03.070 flour
00:07:03.250 at
00:07:03.430 a
00:07:03.490 time
00:07:03.729 make

00:07:04.690 sure
00:07:04.900 it
00:07:05.020 doesn't
00:07:05.169 clump
00:07:05.470 up
00:07:05.880 so
00:07:06.880 you
00:07:06.940 want
00:07:07.180 to

00:07:07.300 add

00:07:08.350 in
00:07:08.530 small
00:07:08.800 portions
00:07:09.630 just
00:07:10.630 keep

00:07:10.780 repeating
00:07:10.960 this
00:07:11.320 process
00:07:11.550 really
00:07:12.550 this
00:07:12.789 is

00:07:12.970 just
00:07:13.150 going
00:07:13.240 to
00:07:13.300 be
00:07:13.900 very
00:07:13.930 reminiscent
00:07:14.620 of
00:07:14.889 a

00:07:14.979 pancake
00:07:15.400 batter
00:07:15.610 you
00:07:16.030 want
00:07:16.210 this
00:07:16.330 just
00:07:16.539 to

00:07:16.660 coat
00:07:16.840 the
00:07:16.960 back
00:07:17.110 of
00:07:17.289 a
00:07:17.350 spoon
00:07:17.470 I'm
00:07:18.160 just
00:07:18.340 going

00:07:18.460 to
00:07:18.520 put
00:07:18.669 a
00:07:18.820 little
00:07:19.330 bit
00:07:19.450 of
00:07:19.570 salt
00:07:19.810 in
00:07:19.870 here
00:07:20.050 and

00:07:22.200 that
00:07:23.200 is
00:07:23.860 looking
00:07:24.310 good

00:07:27.900 now
00:07:28.900 I'm
00:07:28.990 going
00:07:29.110 to
00:07:29.169 get
00:07:29.259 onto
00:07:29.409 the
00:07:29.560 fish
00:07:29.770 we

00:07:30.639 caught
00:07:30.819 some
00:07:31.060 of
00:07:31.090 these
00:07:31.210 guys
00:07:31.479 out
00:07:31.719 in
00:07:31.870 Casco

00:07:32.409 Bay
00:07:32.439 nice
00:07:32.979 and
00:07:33.219 fresh

00:07:33.669 probably
00:07:34.300 quarter
00:07:34.599 this
00:07:36.779 and
00:07:37.779 just
00:07:38.469 nice

00:07:38.680 strips
00:07:39.069 like
00:07:39.310 that
00:07:39.990 I'm
00:07:40.990 going
00:07:41.110 to
00:07:41.169 cut
00:07:41.319 this

00:07:41.439 other
00:07:41.650 guy
00:07:41.830 right
00:07:42.310 in
00:07:42.520 half

00:07:49.120 into
00:07:49.840 the
00:07:49.930 batter

00:07:50.139 so
00:07:50.889 these
00:07:51.009 are
00:07:51.160 just
00:07:51.280 lightly
00:07:51.940 coated
00:07:55.169 so
00:07:56.169 the

00:07:56.320 important
00:07:56.710 thing
00:07:56.830 when
00:07:56.919 frying
00:07:57.190 this
00:07:57.370 fish
