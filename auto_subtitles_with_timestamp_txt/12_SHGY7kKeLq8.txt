00:01:44.100 bit
00:01:44.189 longer
00:01:44.399 remember
00:01:44.820 just

00:02:20.490 shorter
00:02:20.880 grilling

00:02:21.210 time
00:02:21.330 only
00:02:21.540 three
00:02:21.750 to
00:02:21.960 six
00:02:22.200 minutes
00:02:22.530 that

00:02:22.710 removes
00:02:23.370 a
00:02:23.490 lot
00:02:23.760 of
00:02:23.820 the
00:02:23.970 worry
00:02:24.210 about
00:02:24.330 the

00:02:24.540 insides
00:02:25.140 being
00:02:25.560 cooked
00:02:25.830 the
00:02:26.310 third
00:02:26.730 way
00:02:27.150 to

00:02:27.510 cook
00:02:27.780 these
00:02:27.960 is
00:02:28.410 kind
00:02:29.130 of
00:02:29.220 a
00:02:29.250 combination
00:02:29.610 of

00:02:29.790 the
00:02:29.880 first
00:02:30.060 two

00:02:32.190 a

00:02:32.310 brats
00:02:32.670 tub
00:02:33.060 I
00:02:33.480 think
00:02:34.080 it's
00:02:34.230 the
00:02:34.380 most
00:02:34.890 fun

00:02:35.340 to
00:02:35.370 cook
00:02:35.640 brats
00:02:35.970 simple
00:02:36.720 shallow

00:02:37.590 with

00:02:38.220 the

00:02:42.900 you
00:02:43.709 put

00:02:43.920 that
00:02:44.100 pin
00:02:44.340 right
00:02:44.670 there
00:02:44.940 on
00:02:45.209 the

00:02:49.380 this
00:02:49.830 gives
00:02:50.130 the
