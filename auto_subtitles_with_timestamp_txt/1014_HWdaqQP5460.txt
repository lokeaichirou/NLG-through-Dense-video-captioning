00:01:08.189 use

00:01:08.369 jasmine
00:01:08.880 rice
00:01:09.030 because
00:01:09.420 it
00:01:09.540 actually
00:01:09.689 has
00:01:09.990 a

00:01:10.020 unique
00:01:10.560 fragrance
00:01:11.000 even
00:01:12.000 when
00:01:12.150 it's
00:01:12.299 raw
00:01:12.510 when

00:01:12.689 you
00:01:12.750 open
00:01:13.049 a
00:01:13.110 bag

00:01:14.310 that
00:01:14.520 beautiful
00:01:15.290 floral
00:01:16.290 smell
00:01:17.070 that
00:01:17.310 you
00:01:17.460 can

00:01:17.640 that's
00:01:18.060 unique
00:01:18.600 from
00:01:18.930 other
00:01:19.320 kinds
00:01:19.710 of
00:01:19.770 rice

00:01:20.450 the
00:01:21.450 most
00:01:21.720 important
00:01:22.290 thing
00:01:22.439 about
00:01:22.560 rice
00:01:22.890 with

00:01:23.130 fried
00:01:23.220 rice
00:01:23.580 is
00:01:23.820 that
00:01:23.850 it
00:01:24.060 cannot
00:01:24.479 be
00:01:24.810 too

00:01:25.500 mushy
00:01:25.830 over
00:01:26.670 cooked
00:01:27.299 too
00:01:27.479 much
00:01:27.509 water
00:01:27.960 in
00:01:28.170 it

00:01:28.259 because
00:01:28.950 you
00:01:29.220 will
00:01:29.700 then
00:01:29.880 get
00:01:30.090 mushy
00:01:30.420 fried

00:01:30.869 rice
00:01:31.110 so
00:01:31.290 the
00:01:31.439 rice
00:01:31.590 has
00:01:31.740 to
00:01:31.860 be
00:01:31.950 cooked

00:01:32.070 through
00:01:32.549 but
00:01:32.729 the
00:01:33.210 grains
00:01:33.570 maintain

00:01:34.320 integrity
00:01:34.740 it
00:01:35.610 shouldn't
00:01:36.000 be
00:01:36.119 it
00:01:36.299 shouldn't

00:01:36.329 look
00:01:36.659 like
00:01:36.810 it's
00:01:36.990 bursted
00:01:37.680 or
00:01:38.040 the
00:01:38.909 edges
00:01:39.270 are

00:01:39.420 starting
00:01:39.810 to
00:01:39.990 kind
00:01:40.500 of
00:01:40.560 get
00:01:40.740 a
00:01:40.799 little
00:01:41.100 bit

00:01:41.220 soft
00:01:41.520 and
00:01:42.320 I
00:01:43.320 cook
00:01:43.740 this
00:01:43.920 rice
00:01:44.100 yesterday
00:01:44.750 it's

00:01:45.750 actually
00:01:46.200 better
00:01:46.590 to
00:01:46.770 do
00:01:47.610 fried
00:01:47.909 rice
00:01:48.149 we're

00:01:48.720 not
00:01:48.840 better
00:01:49.049 but
00:01:49.259 easier
00:01:49.799 to
00:01:50.009 do
00:01:50.100 fried
00:01:50.310 rice

00:01:50.520 with
00:01:50.759 cold
00:01:51.060 rice
00:01:51.299 because
00:01:51.659 the
00:01:51.780 grains

00:01:52.130 separate
00:01:53.130 more
00:01:53.369 easily

00:01:53.940 we
00:01:54.180 don't
00:01:54.360 tend
00:01:54.600 to
00:01:54.690 clump
00:01:54.990 up
00:01:55.140 as
00:01:55.380 much
00:01:56.030 short

00:01:57.030 grain
00:01:57.270 rice
00:01:57.300 will
00:01:57.990 not
00:01:58.200 work
00:01:58.500 for
00:01:58.710 this

00:01:58.830 because
00:01:59.100 they
00:02:00.060 tend
00:02:00.300 to
00:02:00.390 be
00:02:00.540 a
00:02:00.570 little
00:02:00.780 sticky

00:02:01.140 and
00:02:01.430 longer
00:02:02.430 super
00:02:03.030 long
00:02:03.180 green
00:02:03.420 like
00:02:03.630 basmati

00:02:04.020 rice
00:02:04.200 is
00:02:04.710 not
00:02:04.860 quite
00:02:05.190 as
00:02:05.370 fluffy
00:02:05.880 so
00:02:06.390 jasmine

00:02:06.870 rice
00:02:07.050 is
00:02:07.560 perfect
00:02:08.130 for
00:02:08.310 this
00:02:08.369 so
00:02:08.850 there
00:02:09.030 we've

00:02:09.150 got
00:02:09.330 that
00:02:09.600 other
00:02:10.170 than
00:02:10.530 that
00:02:10.710 there's
00:02:11.070 not

00:02:11.370 whole
00:02:11.610 lot

00:02:15.150 already
00:02:15.360 chopped

00:02:24.660 really
00:02:25.080 fat
00:02:25.410 in
00:02:25.710 the

00:02:25.860 white
00:02:26.040 part
00:02:26.340 make

00:03:05.940 let's
00:03:06.270 talk

00:03:06.390 about
00:03:06.450 soy
00:03:06.780 sauce
00:03:07.080 a
00:03:07.110 little
00:03:07.380 bit
00:03:07.560 this
00:03:08.550 is
00:03:08.610 a

00:03:08.790 recipe
00:03:09.360 where
00:03:09.660 if
00:03:09.810 you
00:03:09.930 can
00:03:10.080 get
00:03:10.230 your
00:03:10.410 hand
00:03:10.709 on

00:03:10.980 Thai
00:03:11.340 soy
00:03:11.670 sauce
00:03:11.970 it
00:03:12.780 will
00:03:13.020 actually
00:03:13.200 make
00:03:13.560 a

00:03:14.310 not
00:03:14.610 all
00:03:14.850 soy
00:03:15.060 sauces
00:03:15.540 are
00:03:15.660 created
00:03:16.080 equal

00:03:16.680 Thai
00:03:17.040 Chinese
00:03:17.400 Japanese
00:03:18.090 soy
00:03:18.239 sauce
00:03:18.510 is
00:03:18.690 all

00:03:18.870 differ
00:03:19.320 in
00:03:19.650 flavor
00:03:19.980 and
00:03:20.160 color
00:03:20.610 Thai
00:03:21.830 version

00:03:22.830 is
00:03:23.070 lighter
00:03:23.820 in
00:03:24.120 both
00:03:24.300 color
00:03:24.600 and
00:03:24.780 flavor
00:03:24.930 and

00:03:25.290 in
00:03:26.250 my
00:03:26.760 opinion
00:03:26.910 and
00:03:27.480 I'm
00:03:27.810 a
00:03:27.840 little
00:03:28.140 bit

00:03:28.230 biased
00:03:28.440 it's
00:03:28.800 a
00:03:28.890 little
00:03:29.070 bit
00:03:29.160 more
00:03:29.310 fragrant

00:03:29.880 and
00:03:30.239 we
00:03:30.570 call
00:03:30.780 this
00:03:30.959 EU
00:03:31.290 cow
00:03:31.620 or
00:03:31.980 literally

00:03:32.550 white
00:03:32.880 soy
00:03:33.150 sauce
00:03:33.470 even
00:03:34.470 though
00:03:34.530 it's
00:03:34.680 not

00:03:34.800 white
00:03:35.100 but
00:03:35.670 it's
00:03:35.790 named
00:03:36.150 to
00:03:36.450 contrast
00:03:36.989 see
00:03:37.530 you

00:03:37.620 dumb
00:03:37.890 or
00:03:38.130 black
00:03:38.400 soy
00:03:38.640 sauce
00:03:38.940 which
00:03:39.150 is
00:03:39.180 a

00:03:39.300 thicker
00:03:39.630 darker
00:03:40.019 sweeter
00:03:40.560 version
00:03:40.700 so
00:03:41.700 if
00:03:42.030 you

00:03:42.239 can't
00:03:42.450 find
00:03:42.750 this
00:03:43.019 I'm

00:03:43.890 boyfriend
00:03:44.720 you
00:03:45.720 can

00:03:47.620 sauce
00:03:47.740 all
00:03:48.700 right
00:03:48.880 so
00:03:49.090 that's
00:03:49.210 that
00:03:49.390 for

00:03:50.050 seasoning
00:03:50.620 other

00:04:02.500 of
00:04:02.530 protein
00:04:03.130 if
00:04:03.370 you're
00:04:03.610 using
00:04:03.730 raw
00:04:04.180 protein

00:04:04.690 like
00:04:04.900 chicken
00:04:04.930 or
00:04:05.290 pork
00:04:05.530 I
00:04:05.800 like
00:04:06.280 to

00:04:07.420 with
00:04:07.720 soy
00:04:08.470 sauce
00:04:08.560 so
00:04:08.920 it
00:04:09.010 has

00:04:09.130 some
00:04:09.280 flavor

00:04:19.570 let's
00:04:19.959 go
00:04:20.109 to

00:04:20.170 the
00:04:20.380 stove
00:04:20.530 so
00:04:21.450 I've
00:04:22.450 got
00:04:22.690 here
00:04:22.900 a
00:04:22.960 couple

00:04:23.020 tablespoons
00:04:23.620 of
00:04:24.100 vegetable
00:04:24.280 oil
00:04:24.550 in
00:04:25.060 a

00:04:25.150 non-stick
00:04:25.180 pan

00:04:29.230 not
00:04:29.680 one
00:04:29.890 that
00:04:30.040 would
00:04:30.190 work

00:04:30.400 with
00:04:30.670 this
00:04:30.910 though
00:04:31.150 anyway
00:04:31.570 um
00:04:32.200 so
00:04:32.590 once
00:04:32.860 the

00:04:33.070 oil
00:04:33.100 is
00:04:33.610 hot
00:04:33.960 you
00:04:34.960 can
00:04:35.140 add
00:04:35.320 in
00:04:35.470 some
00:04:35.500 garlic

00:04:39.660 okay
00:04:40.660 now
00:04:40.900 if
00:04:41.080 you're
00:04:41.260 using
00:04:42.180 raw
00:04:43.180 protein

00:04:46.300 you
00:04:46.510 are

00:04:46.690 using
00:04:46.870 raw
00:04:47.169 protein
00:04:47.440 once
00:04:48.190 the
00:04:48.430 garlic
00:04:48.669 starts

00:04:49.120 to
00:04:49.450 turn
00:04:49.750 a
00:04:50.110 little
00:04:50.590 bit
00:04:50.800 Brown
00:04:50.860 the
00:04:51.580 smallest

00:04:51.940 bit
00:04:52.270 starts
00:04:52.570 turn
00:04:52.780 brown
00:04:53.080 that's
00:04:53.560 when
00:04:53.800 you

00:04:53.890 want
00:04:54.070 to
00:04:54.160 add

00:04:55.630 to

00:04:55.780 60%

00:06:33.400 that
00:06:33.520 you
00:06:33.640 can't

00:06:33.820 use
00:06:34.060 it
00:06:34.090 in
00:06:34.450 restaurants
00:06:35.080 we
00:06:35.710 use
00:06:35.890 hot
00:06:36.100 rice

00:06:36.340 all
00:06:36.520 the
00:06:36.640 time
00:06:36.850 because
00:06:37.000 now
00:06:37.530 there's
00:06:38.530 no

00:06:38.620 sense
00:06:38.890 keeping
00:06:39.130 a
00:06:39.340 whole
00:06:39.490 other
00:06:39.640 set
00:06:39.940 of
00:06:39.970 cool

00:06:40.390 rice
00:06:40.690 it
00:06:40.930 just
00:06:41.500 becomes
00:06:42.100 a
00:06:42.370 little
00:06:42.520 bit
00:06:42.730 harder

00:06:43.060 you
00:06:43.090 need
00:06:43.750 more
00:06:43.960 attention
00:06:44.110 and
00:06:44.620 breaking
00:06:44.980 it

00:06:45.070 apart
00:06:48.210 let
00:06:49.210 it
00:06:49.300 sit
00:06:49.570 for
00:06:49.600 a
00:06:49.900 little
00:06:49.960 bit
00:06:51.300 to
00:06:52.300 the

00:06:52.420 store
00:06:52.750 so
00:06:52.870 I've
00:06:52.990 got
00:06:53.140 on
00:06:53.350 medium-high
00:06:53.920 heat

00:06:58.539 final
00:06:59.539 boss
00:06:59.839 and
00:07:00.229 then
00:07:00.439 that's
00:07:00.679 pretty
00:07:00.889 much

00:07:01.009 done
00:07:02.649 if
00:07:03.649 you
00:07:03.860 if
00:07:04.099 you're
00:07:04.249 not
00:07:04.369 sure
00:07:04.580 if
00:07:04.699 it's

00:07:04.819 done
00:07:04.999 you
00:07:05.179 can
00:07:05.209 just
00:07:05.479 feel
00:07:05.689 it
00:07:05.839 with
00:07:05.989 your

00:07:06.110 finger
00:07:06.409 to
00:07:06.529 see
00:07:06.709 if
00:07:06.769 it's
00:07:06.889 hot
00:07:07.069 give
00:07:07.789 all
00:07:07.909 the

00:07:08.029 rice
00:07:08.179 isn't
00:07:08.419 hot
00:07:08.659 and
00:07:08.989 if
00:07:09.229 it
00:07:09.349 is
00:07:09.469 go
00:07:09.769 into
00:07:10.009 the

00:07:10.129 green
00:07:10.279 onion
00:07:10.639 you
00:07:11.239 want
00:07:11.419 to
00:07:11.539 add
00:07:11.629 cilantro
00:07:11.989 to

00:07:12.259 this
00:07:12.909 go
00:07:13.909 for
00:07:14.299 it
00:07:14.829 and
00:07:17.589 that's
00:07:18.589 it

00:07:19.039 that's
00:07:19.309 done
00:07:19.579 let's
00:07:19.879 go
00:07:20.659 over
00:07:20.809 there
00:07:20.929 and
00:07:21.049 put

00:07:36.650 so
00:07:37.650 this
00:07:38.389 feeds
00:07:39.389 me
00:07:39.659 twice
00:07:40.220 but
00:07:41.220 it's
00:07:41.400 for
00:07:42.000 big

00:07:42.150 growing
00:07:42.389 boy
00:07:42.690 it's
00:07:42.900 probably

00:07:43.650 like
00:07:43.889 one

00:07:44.220 large
00:07:45.050 portion

00:08:00.010 that
00:08:00.580 now
00:08:01.480 it's
00:08:01.720 not
00:08:01.930 over

00:08:05.260 want
