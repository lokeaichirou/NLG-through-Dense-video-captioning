00:06:43.389 be
00:06:43.540 fine
00:06:43.780 but

00:06:44.560 I

00:06:45.610 make
00:06:45.760 my
00:06:45.970 falafels
00:06:46.570 thin
00:06:47.530 so

00:06:54.490 a
00:06:55.000 paniyaram
00:06:55.360 pan

00:06:55.389 and
00:06:56.050 made

00:06:57.790 so
00:06:57.970 much
00:06:58.030 oil

00:07:00.400 always
00:07:00.610 a

00:07:00.729 good

00:07:09.820 needs
00:07:10.060 very
00:07:10.210 little
00:07:10.990 amount
00:07:11.260 of
00:07:11.350 time
