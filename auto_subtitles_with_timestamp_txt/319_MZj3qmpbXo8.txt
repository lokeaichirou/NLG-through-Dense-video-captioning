00:01:10.220 ok
00:01:11.220 let's
00:01:11.430 get

00:01:11.549 started
00:01:11.670 first
00:01:12.330 step
00:01:12.659 I've
00:01:12.930 got
00:01:13.200 two
00:01:13.530 and
00:01:13.740 a

00:01:13.770 half
00:01:13.950 pounds
00:01:14.610 of
00:01:14.640 russet
00:01:15.180 potatoes
00:01:15.900 that
00:01:16.049 have

00:01:16.110 been
00:01:16.200 sliced
00:01:16.650 about
00:01:17.040 that
00:01:17.490 thick
00:01:17.939 maybe
00:01:18.659 about

00:01:18.900 an
00:01:19.020 inch
00:01:19.140 or
00:01:19.380 so
00:01:19.409 they
00:01:20.159 are
00:01:20.310 unpeeled
00:01:20.909 and
00:01:21.119 I'd

00:01:21.180 like
00:01:21.360 to
00:01:21.420 do
00:01:21.689 that
00:01:21.869 because
00:01:22.049 the
00:01:22.710 peel
00:01:22.920 adds

00:01:23.189 extra
00:01:23.549 flavor
00:01:23.640 and
00:01:24.240 texture
00:01:24.570 and
00:01:24.869 also

00:01:25.380 increases
00:01:26.100 the
00:01:26.189 nutrition
00:01:26.700 of
00:01:26.970 the
00:01:27.000 recipe

00:01:27.540 two
00:01:28.110 and
00:01:28.229 a
00:01:28.259 half
00:01:28.380 pounds
00:01:28.710 is
00:01:28.770 about
00:01:28.890 eight

00:01:29.220 medium
00:01:29.579 sized
00:01:29.970 potatoes
00:01:30.180 now
00:01:30.869 I'm
00:01:30.930 going
00:01:31.049 to

00:01:31.110 put
00:01:31.259 them
00:01:31.350 into
00:01:31.500 my
00:01:31.619 pressure
00:01:31.890 cooker
00:01:32.040 along

00:01:32.520 with
00:01:32.700 about
00:01:32.880 five
00:01:33.119 cloves
00:01:33.570 of
00:01:33.840 garlic
00:01:34.200 chopped

00:01:34.500 up
00:01:34.820 and
00:01:35.820 a
00:01:35.880 cup
00:01:36.210 of
00:01:36.329 water
00:01:36.509 now
00:01:37.320 if
00:01:37.409 you
00:01:37.470 don't

00:01:37.560 have
00:01:37.710 a
00:01:37.770 pressure
00:01:38.009 cooker
00:01:38.220 don't
00:01:38.579 worry
00:01:38.820 you

00:01:39.180 can
00:01:39.360 cook
00:01:39.540 your
00:01:39.689 potatoes
00:01:39.840 anyway
00:01:40.619 all
00:01:40.860 you're

00:01:40.979 doing
00:01:41.220 at
00:01:41.310 this
00:01:41.400 point
00:01:41.640 is
00:01:41.729 making
00:01:41.970 garlic

00:01:42.509 mashed
00:01:42.720 potatoes
00:01:42.810 so
00:01:43.619 you
00:01:43.710 can
00:01:43.829 cook
00:01:43.920 them

00:01:44.040 with
00:01:44.100 a
00:01:44.189 microwave
00:01:44.579 you
00:01:44.909 can
00:01:45.060 boil
00:01:45.329 them
00:01:45.570 you

00:01:45.750 can
00:01:45.899 steam
00:01:46.229 them
00:01:46.470 you
00:01:47.130 can
00:01:47.310 roast
00:01:47.579 them

00:01:47.939 however
00:01:48.420 you
00:01:48.780 want
00:01:48.840 to
00:01:48.990 do
00:01:49.140 that
00:01:49.320 to
00:01:49.649 me

00:01:50.560 mashed
00:01:51.560 potatoes
00:01:52.009 I
00:01:52.310 just
00:01:52.970 like
00:01:53.090 to
00:01:53.210 do
00:01:53.329 it
00:01:53.479 in

00:01:53.630 my
00:01:53.750 pressure
00:01:54.020 cooker
00:01:54.140 because
00:01:54.740 it
00:01:55.009 takes

00:01:55.220 eight
00:01:55.490 to
00:01:55.729 the
00:01:55.759 minutes
00:01:56.060 which
00:01:56.240 is
00:01:56.450 very
00:01:57.049 fast

00:01:57.290 and
00:01:57.920 it
00:01:58.009 also
00:01:58.130 retains
00:01:58.640 a
00:01:58.759 lot
00:01:58.909 more
00:01:59.090 of
00:01:59.299 the

00:01:59.390 nutrition
00:02:00.729 next
00:02:01.729 step
00:02:01.909 bacon
00:02:02.659 now
00:02:03.500 in
00:02:03.920 Ireland

00:02:04.520 this
00:02:04.700 was
00:02:04.880 probably
00:02:05.270 made
00:02:05.780 more
00:02:06.170 frequently

00:02:06.710 with
00:02:07.100 the
00:02:07.340 cheaper
00:02:07.820 cuts
00:02:07.850 of
00:02:08.390 the
00:02:08.599 pig
00:02:08.840 basic

00:02:09.619 pork
00:02:09.920 belly
00:02:10.190 pork
00:02:11.000 jowl
00:02:11.920 hocks

00:02:13.190 smoked
00:02:13.550 hocks
00:02:13.819 and
00:02:14.269 things
00:02:14.540 like
00:02:14.720 that
00:02:15.170 now

00:02:15.500 pork
00:02:15.800 belly
00:02:16.010 is
00:02:16.190 probably
00:02:16.730 the
00:02:17.120 best
00:02:17.510 meat
00:02:18.080 to

00:02:18.440 get
00:02:18.590 for
00:02:19.069 kokkonen

00:02:19.910 in
00:02:20.120 my
00:02:20.239 opinion
00:02:20.599 I
00:02:20.810 couldn't
00:02:21.380 find
00:02:21.560 any
00:02:21.860 at
00:02:22.040 the

00:02:22.130 grocery
00:02:22.489 store
00:02:22.700 they
00:02:22.790 were
00:02:22.880 all
00:02:23.090 out
00:02:23.330 so
00:02:24.080 I

00:02:24.110 just
00:02:24.200 grabbed
00:02:24.590 some
00:02:24.769 of
00:02:24.950 the
00:02:25.010 center
00:02:25.280 cut

00:02:25.459 bacon
00:02:25.489 it's
00:02:25.940 got
00:02:26.090 a
00:02:26.120 little
00:02:26.420 bit
00:02:26.510 less
00:02:26.780 fat
00:02:27.110 in

00:02:27.319 it
00:02:27.410 a
00:02:27.560 little
00:02:27.709 bit
00:02:27.860 more
00:02:28.010 lean
00:02:28.280 so
00:02:28.489 it's
00:02:28.610 going

00:02:28.730 to
00:02:28.790 be
00:02:28.850 a
00:02:28.880 big
00:02:29.030 meteor
00:02:29.390 and
00:02:29.989 I'm
00:02:30.110 going
00:02:30.470 to

00:02:30.530 render
00:02:31.010 all

00:02:31.850 fat
00:02:32.209 out
00:02:32.450 and
00:02:32.840 get
00:02:33.019 the

00:02:33.140 visib
00:02:33.470 a

00:02:35.299 up
00:02:35.390 here

00:03:42.150 don't
00:03:43.150 reserve
00:03:43.390 that
00:03:43.660 fat
00:03:47.310 eight
00:03:48.310 minutes
00:03:48.790 in

00:03:48.910 the
00:03:49.000 pressure
00:03:49.270 cooker
00:03:49.390 and
00:03:49.720 my

00:03:50.740 nice

00:03:51.459 tender
00:03:51.700 s
00:03:52.090 so
00:03:52.720 fast
00:03:53.110 so
00:03:54.010 now
00:03:54.160 I'm

00:03:54.400 going
00:03:54.610 to
00:03:54.670 mash
00:03:54.850 them
00:03:55.090 with
00:03:55.270 a
00:03:55.300 stick
00:03:55.840 of

00:03:56.050 butter
00:03:56.080 and
00:03:57.690 about
00:03:58.690 half
00:03:59.110 a
00:03:59.290 cup
00:03:59.530 of
00:03:59.890 heavy

00:04:00.610 cream
00:04:03.720 now
00:04:04.750 we're
00:04:05.080 not
00:04:05.290 mashed
00:04:05.590 potatoes

00:04:06.220 you'll
00:04:06.700 see
00:04:06.880 I'm
00:04:06.970 actually
00:04:07.180 using
00:04:07.540 a
00:04:07.840 masher

00:04:08.260 for
00:04:08.980 several
00:04:09.340 years
00:04:09.520 I
00:04:09.700 put
00:04:09.910 them
00:04:10.090 into
00:04:10.239 my

00:04:10.330 KitchenAid
00:04:10.959 and
00:04:11.140 I
00:04:11.200 whipped
00:04:11.709 them
00:04:12.040 to
00:04:12.190 them

00:04:12.400 until
00:04:12.610 they
00:04:12.820 were
00:04:12.850 light
00:04:13.239 and
00:04:13.510 fluffy
00:04:13.840 but

00:04:14.170 what
00:04:14.980 I
00:04:15.010 discovered
00:04:15.810 after
00:04:16.810 working
00:04:17.049 on

00:04:17.260 MasterChef
00:04:17.950 is
00:04:18.760 that
00:04:19.209 the
00:04:19.359 texture
00:04:19.840 of
00:04:19.989 mashed

00:04:20.230 potatoes
00:04:20.730 when
00:04:21.730 you
00:04:21.910 whip
00:04:22.330 them
00:04:22.660 and
00:04:22.870 overwork

00:04:23.500 them
00:04:23.710 becomes
00:04:24.430 kind
00:04:24.669 of
00:04:24.730 gooey
00:04:25.150 and
00:04:25.390 sticky

00:04:25.660 and
00:04:26.380 that
00:04:26.500 was
00:04:26.650 accustomed
00:04:27.310 to
00:04:27.370 that
00:04:27.550 being

00:04:27.790 the
00:04:28.060 texture
00:04:28.450 I
00:04:28.480 should
00:04:28.870 expect
00:04:29.580 but
00:04:30.580 it
00:04:30.669 turns

00:04:30.880 out
00:04:31.180 that
00:04:31.330 when
00:04:31.510 you
00:04:31.540 just
00:04:31.780 lightly
00:04:32.200 mash
00:04:32.710 them

00:04:33.040 you
00:04:33.130 get
00:04:33.280 a
00:04:33.310 much
00:04:33.640 fluffier
00:04:34.390 light
00:04:34.840 texture
00:04:35.590 to

00:04:35.740 them
00:04:35.890 so
00:04:36.640 use
00:04:37.150 just
00:04:37.419 a
00:04:37.510 masher
00:04:38.050 or
00:04:38.080 a
00:04:38.410 fork
00:04:38.800 if

00:04:39.370 you've
00:04:39.610 got
00:04:39.850 the
00:04:40.030 potato
00:04:40.390 ricer
00:04:41.050 which
00:04:41.260 is

00:04:41.380 like
00:04:41.500 a
00:04:41.530 giant
00:04:41.919 garlic
00:04:42.400 press
00:04:42.700 that
00:04:42.910 presses

00:04:43.360 them
00:04:43.479 out
00:04:43.600 that
00:04:43.900 gives
00:04:44.169 you
00:04:44.290 the
00:04:44.380 best
00:04:44.560 texture

00:04:45.040 of
00:04:45.220 all
00:04:45.460 but
00:04:46.180 don't
00:04:46.450 get
00:04:46.690 in
00:04:46.840 there
00:04:47.020 with
00:04:47.200 your

00:04:47.290 immersion
00:04:47.560 blender
00:04:48.100 our
00:04:48.490 part
00:04:48.970 or
00:04:49.180 your
00:04:49.360 hand

00:04:49.720 mixer
00:04:50.080 or
00:04:50.470 put
00:04:50.710 them
00:04:50.890 in
00:04:50.919 your
00:04:51.310 stand
00:04:51.580 mixer

00:04:51.669 because
00:04:52.390 it
00:04:52.630 is
00:04:52.720 going
00:04:52.930 to
00:04:53.020 absolutely
00:04:53.350 ruin

00:04:54.130 the
00:04:54.430 beautiful
00:04:54.850 fluffy
00:04:55.540 texture
00:04:56.140 of
00:04:56.410 those

00:04:56.530 potatoes
00:04:59.220 and
00:05:00.220 now
00:05:00.490 I
00:05:00.520 have
00:05:00.910 a
00:05:00.940 bowl
00:05:01.240 of

00:05:01.380 beautiful
00:05:02.380 fluffy
00:05:02.740 mashed
00:05:03.040 potatoes
00:05:03.580 this
00:05:04.360 is

00:05:04.540 the
00:05:04.690 time
00:05:04.900 to
00:05:05.110 season
00:05:05.380 them
00:05:05.680 with
00:05:05.710 salt
00:05:06.070 and

00:05:06.370 pepper
00:05:10.290 the
00:05:11.290 bacon
00:05:11.590 fat

00:05:13.710 now
00:05:14.710 how
00:05:15.460 much
00:05:15.520 makes
00:05:15.910 up
00:05:16.060 a
00:05:16.180 lot
00:05:16.360 of
00:05:16.390 space
00:05:16.780 to

00:05:17.260 fill
00:05:17.290 your
00:05:17.920 skillet
00:05:18.250 but
00:05:18.970 80%
00:05:19.300 of
00:05:19.720 cabbages

00:05:20.170 water
00:05:20.500 and
00:05:20.800 air
00:05:21.010 and
00:05:21.940 all
00:05:22.180 of
00:05:22.420 those
00:05:22.570 will
00:05:22.900 air

00:05:23.470 pockets
00:05:24.010 inside
00:05:24.220 the
00:05:24.490 cabbage
00:05:24.940 are
00:05:25.180 going
00:05:25.300 to

00:05:25.360 collapse
00:05:25.750 and
00:05:26.560 so
00:05:26.680 this
00:05:26.860 is
00:05:26.980 going
00:05:27.130 to
00:05:27.190 reduce

00:05:27.310 by
00:05:27.730 half
00:05:27.760 fairly
00:05:28.600 quickly
00:05:30.090 then
00:05:31.090 give

00:05:31.270 yourself
00:05:31.360 a
00:05:31.690 little
00:05:31.870 bit
00:05:32.020 of
00:05:32.140 salt
00:05:32.410 to
00:05:32.650 the

00:05:32.800 cabbage
00:05:33.190 while
00:05:33.430 that's
00:05:33.610 cooking
00:05:33.930 and
00:05:35.460 a

00:05:36.460 splash
00:05:37.270 of
00:05:37.570 vinegar
00:05:37.720 I'm
00:05:38.050 just
00:05:38.200 going
00:05:38.320 to
00:05:38.380 use

00:05:38.470 apple
00:05:38.800 cider
00:05:38.950 vinegar
00:05:39.130 right
00:05:39.490 now
00:05:39.610 vinegar

00:05:39.940 goes
00:05:40.090 really
00:05:40.360 well
00:05:40.480 with
00:05:40.660 cabbage
00:05:41.080 you
00:05:41.470 really

00:05:42.250 do
