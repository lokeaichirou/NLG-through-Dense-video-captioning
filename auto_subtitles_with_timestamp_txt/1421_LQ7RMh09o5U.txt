00:01:07.170 was
00:01:07.530 what
00:01:07.680 I
00:01:07.800 think
00:01:08.040 all
00:01:08.340 right
00:01:08.550 so
00:01:08.760 you've

00:01:09.240 already
00:01:09.479 started
00:01:09.660 this
00:01:09.900 process
00:01:10.140 and
00:01:10.940 the

00:01:11.940 first
00:01:12.210 part
00:01:12.509 of
00:01:12.690 it
00:01:12.920 has
00:01:14.090 to
00:01:15.090 do
00:01:15.210 with
00:01:15.360 the

00:01:15.509 peeling

00:01:55.740 about
00:01:57.289 ok
00:01:58.310 bite-sized
00:01:59.310 I
00:01:59.340 guess

00:01:59.819 something
00:02:00.450 more
00:02:00.569 than
00:02:00.630 that

00:03:09.230 like
00:03:09.470 a
00:03:09.500 white
00:03:09.860 cloud

00:03:10.280 everything
00:03:11.090 will
00:03:11.239 be
00:03:11.269 dusty
00:03:11.750 all
00:03:11.930 around
00:03:12.200 the

00:03:13.099 show
00:03:13.310 because
00:03:13.760 this
00:03:14.000 is
00:03:14.120 how
00:03:14.209 my
00:03:14.360 grandfather

00:03:14.660 was
00:03:14.930 they
00:03:15.260 literally
00:03:15.590 sit
00:03:15.890 there
00:03:16.010 with
00:03:16.099 a
00:03:16.190 bowl

00:03:16.370 and
00:03:16.879 go
00:03:17.060 like
00:03:17.239 this
00:03:20.230 until
00:03:21.230 all
00:03:21.290 this
00:03:21.890 all
00:03:22.430 that

00:03:22.489 oil
00:03:23.860 was
00:03:25.510 like
00:03:26.510 it
00:03:27.319 was
00:03:27.470 smooth
00:03:27.769 odd
00:03:28.160 how
00:03:28.609 much

00:03:29.299 water
00:03:29.660 and
00:03:29.930 does
00:03:30.079 it
00:03:30.170 matter
00:03:30.319 if
00:03:30.440 it's
00:03:30.650 cold
00:03:30.829 or

00:03:31.069 hot
00:03:31.220 it
00:03:32.090 my
00:03:32.630 mom
00:03:32.840 always
00:03:33.079 said
00:03:33.380 one
00:03:33.620 cup
00:03:33.950 of

00:03:33.980 cold
00:03:34.340 water
00:03:35.410 up
00:03:36.410 or
00:03:36.709 most
00:03:37.310 of
00:03:37.519 it
00:03:37.639 in
00:03:37.760 there

00:03:37.910 just
00:03:38.060 leave
00:03:38.180 a
00:03:38.239 little
00:03:38.329 bit
00:03:38.780 and
00:03:39.549 then
00:03:40.549 the

00:03:41.420 nasty
00:03:41.870 part
00:03:42.970 it's
00:03:43.970 getting

00:03:46.580 making
00:03:47.510 the
00:03:47.630 dough
00:03:49.840 big
00:03:50.840 ball
00:03:51.110 is
00:03:51.500 a
00:03:51.970 good
00:03:52.970 idea

00:03:55.270 you
00:03:56.270 see
00:03:56.570 I
00:03:56.600 didn't
00:03:57.020 put
00:03:57.230 all
00:03:57.350 the
00:03:57.530 water
00:03:57.770 in

00:03:57.980 there
00:03:58.130 so
00:03:58.370 it's
00:03:59.000 not
00:03:59.210 all
00:03:59.450 pumping
00:03:59.960 together

00:04:00.290 yet
00:04:01.120 and
00:04:02.120 then
00:04:02.270 when
00:04:02.390 I
00:04:02.420 see
00:04:02.690 I'm
00:04:02.870 close
00:04:03.230 I
00:04:04.330 put

00:04:05.330 the
00:04:05.450 rest
00:04:05.690 in
00:04:10.660 at
00:04:11.660 this
00:04:11.960 stage
00:04:12.460 you're
00:04:13.460 going

00:04:13.640 to
00:04:13.700 put
00:04:13.970 it
00:04:14.090 in
00:04:14.270 a
00:04:14.390 bowl
00:04:14.600 and
00:04:14.960 let
00:04:15.140 it
00:04:15.200 sit
00:04:15.560 and

00:04:15.710 rest
00:04:16.010 for
00:04:16.280 about
00:04:16.900 45
00:04:17.900 minutes
00:04:17.930 I
00:04:18.410 guess
00:04:18.650 I

00:04:18.859 always
00:04:19.040 cover
00:04:19.400 it
00:04:19.609 just
00:04:19.820 to
00:04:20.060 keep
00:04:20.209 stuff
00:04:20.570 from

00:04:21.490 getting
00:04:22.490 in
00:04:22.580 it
00:04:22.760 and
00:04:22.880 that
00:04:22.910 but
00:04:23.270 it'll
00:04:23.570 sit

00:04:23.780 there
00:04:23.960 and
00:04:24.080 rest
00:04:24.290 for
00:04:24.650 about
00:04:25.420 45
00:04:26.420 minutes
00:04:26.690 to

00:04:26.900 an
00:04:27.500 hour
00:04:27.650 before
00:04:28.520 you're
00:04:28.700 ready
00:04:28.730 to
00:04:29.000 start

00:04:29.270 rolling
00:04:29.630 it
00:04:29.720 up

00:05:33.660 move
00:05:35.220 okay
00:05:36.220 once
00:05:36.520 you
00:05:36.580 take
00:05:36.790 them
00:05:36.910 out
00:05:37.000 of
00:05:37.060 the

00:05:37.120 freezer
00:05:37.180 there
00:05:38.139 they're
00:05:38.530 frozen
00:05:38.770 I
00:05:39.100 just

00:05:39.370 played
00:05:40.330 a
00:05:40.360 little
00:05:40.570 thing
00:05:40.780 and
00:05:40.960 loosens
00:05:41.440 them

00:05:41.560 all
00:05:41.740 up
00:05:41.919 but
00:05:42.070 they'll
00:05:42.250 be
00:05:42.370 like
00:05:42.580 card
00:05:43.380 and
00:05:44.380 then

00:05:44.590 I
00:05:44.800 just
00:05:44.950 put
00:05:45.220 them
00:05:45.460 in
00:05:46.560 these
00:05:47.560 are
00:05:47.740 big
00:05:47.950 ziplock

00:05:48.669 baggies
00:05:49.120 but
00:05:50.100 nobody
00:05:51.100 should
00:05:51.550 be
00:05:51.760 good
00:05:52.060 they

00:05:52.270 won't

00:05:53.650 frozen
00:05:54.040 I
00:05:54.100 won't
00:05:54.280 stick

00:05:54.580 together
00:05:55.919 and
00:05:57.180 you
00:05:58.180 can
00:05:59.639 file
00:06:00.639 them
00:06:00.820 all
00:06:01.000 in

00:06:01.210 there
00:06:01.620 and
00:06:02.620 then
00:06:02.740 you
00:06:02.830 can
00:06:02.919 pull
00:06:03.040 out

00:06:03.610 you
00:06:03.729 need
00:06:03.760 and
00:06:03.940 then
