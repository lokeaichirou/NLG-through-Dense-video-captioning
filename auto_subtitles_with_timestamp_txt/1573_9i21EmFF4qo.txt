00:02:57.470 cooked
00:02:57.740 in
00:02:58.100 the

00:02:58.670 Caribbean
00:02:59.150 and
00:03:00.020 on
00:03:00.260 a
00:03:00.290 regular
00:03:00.740 basis
00:03:01.040 Shore

00:03:01.340 maybe
00:03:01.880 people
00:03:02.180 to
00:03:02.390 defense
00:03:02.720 your

00:03:03.440 and
00:03:03.560 stuff
00:03:03.680 you
00:03:03.830 would
00:03:04.010 get
00:03:04.190 it
00:03:04.310 there
00:03:04.490 so
00:03:05.060 this

00:03:05.330 here
00:03:05.540 is
00:03:05.570 pretty
00:03:06.440 much
00:03:06.620 my
00:03:07.300 interpretation
00:03:08.300 of

00:03:08.480 how
00:03:08.690 we
00:03:08.750 would
00:03:09.080 do
00:03:09.230 mussels
00:03:09.650 if
00:03:09.860 we
00:03:10.340 were
00:03:10.489 doing

00:03:10.760 mussels
00:03:11.180 in
00:03:11.300 the
00:03:11.330 Caribbean
00:03:11.750 I'm
00:03:12.440 just
00:03:12.650 going

00:03:12.830 to
00:03:12.890 go
00:03:13.010 ahead
00:03:13.130 and
00:03:13.400 really
00:03:14.120 want
00:03:14.360 to
00:03:14.420 mix
00:03:14.600 that

00:03:14.810 up
00:03:14.920 turn
00:03:15.920 your
00:03:15.950 heat
00:03:16.280 up
00:03:16.459 to
00:03:16.640 high
00:03:16.670 now
00:03:16.910 because

00:03:17.360 you
00:03:17.420 want
00:03:17.540 to
00:03:17.630 bring
00:03:17.780 that
00:03:17.900 up
00:03:17.959 to
00:03:18.290 a
00:03:18.800 high

00:03:19.040 temperature
00:03:19.280 right
00:03:19.850 away
00:03:23.050 I'm
00:03:24.050 going
00:03:24.230 to
00:03:24.290 go

00:03:24.410 in
00:03:24.530 with
00:03:24.680 a
00:03:24.709 bit
00:03:24.890 of
00:03:25.010 sea
00:03:25.190 salt
00:03:27.160 one
00:03:28.160 chopped
00:03:28.489 up

00:03:28.730 tomato
00:03:29.410 diced
00:03:30.410 up

00:03:39.950 milk
00:03:43.450 and
00:03:44.450 what
00:03:44.989 you
00:03:45.170 could
00:03:45.379 also

00:03:45.650 do
00:03:46.099 is
00:03:46.280 after
