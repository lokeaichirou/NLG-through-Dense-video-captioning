00:00:01.439 these
00:00:01.560 Tomatoes
00:00:02.120 what
00:00:03.120 am
00:00:03.270 I

00:00:03.330 gonna
00:00:03.480 do
00:00:03.720 with
00:00:03.870 them
00:00:04.020 all
00:00:04.230 I
00:00:04.529 have
00:00:05.310 an
00:00:05.430 idea

00:00:05.730 I'm
00:00:05.970 gonna
00:00:06.120 make
00:00:06.359 soup
00:00:06.690 today's
00:00:07.410 soup
00:00:08.160 is

00:00:08.490 really
00:00:09.240 delicious
00:00:09.480 and
00:00:09.900 a
00:00:09.960 little
00:00:10.200 bit

00:00:10.349 different
00:00:10.679 because
00:00:10.740 it's
00:00:10.860 a
00:00:11.099 roasted
00:00:11.610 tomato

00:00:11.639 soup
00:00:12.330 so
00:00:12.780 delicious
00:00:13.469 cut
00:00:14.130 four
00:00:14.370 pounds
00:00:14.700 of

00:00:14.790 plum
00:00:15.240 tomatoes
00:00:15.719 in
00:00:15.900 half
00:00:16.109 I
00:00:16.500 like
00:00:16.740 to
00:00:16.920 use
00:00:17.070 the

00:00:17.250 plum
00:00:17.460 here
00:00:17.730 because
00:00:18.029 they
00:00:18.180 have
00:00:18.330 less
00:00:18.630 liquid

00:00:19.199 in
00:00:19.380 them
00:00:19.560 so
00:00:19.740 the
00:00:19.859 soup
00:00:20.130 will
00:00:20.369 end

00:00:21.090 and
00:00:21.420 a
00:00:21.480 little
00:00:21.510 richer
00:00:22.109 but
00:00:22.410 I
00:00:22.439 suppose
00:00:22.830 you

00:00:22.859 could
00:00:23.279 use
00:00:23.640 regular
00:00:23.939 tomatoes
00:00:24.570 and
00:00:24.779 then
00:00:24.869 just

00:00:25.080 cook
00:00:25.199 them
00:00:25.350 down

00:00:25.619 little
00:00:25.830 more
00:00:26.099 up
00:00:26.369 to
00:00:26.699 you

00:00:26.849 to
00:00:27.599 intensify

00:02:21.030 wouldn't
00:02:21.360 really

00:02:21.540 get

00:02:43.530 simmer
00:02:43.890 and
00:02:44.190 then
00:02:44.250 let

00:02:44.819 it
00:02:44.849 cook
00:02:45.060 uncovered
00:02:45.390 until
00:02:46.260 it's
00:02:46.410 slightly

00:02:46.530 reduced
00:02:47.160 and
00:02:47.430 the
00:02:47.580 tomatoes
00:02:48.030 are
00:02:48.209 really
00:02:48.750 nice

00:02:48.959 and
00:02:49.260 soft
00:02:50.480 when
00:02:51.480 the
00:02:51.630 soup
00:02:51.840 is
00:02:52.019 simmered
00:02:52.410 for

00:02:52.470 twenty-five
00:02:53.069 minutes
00:02:53.400 it's
00:02:53.730 time
00:02:53.849 to
00:02:54.269 puree

00:02:54.630 it
00:02:54.810 I'm
00:02:55.230 gonna
00:02:55.470 use
00:02:55.620 an
00:02:55.769 immersion
00:02:56.160 blender

00:02:56.190 because
00:02:56.819 I
00:02:56.849 have
00:02:57.180 one
00:02:57.480 and
00:02:57.750 I
00:02:57.930 really
00:02:58.200 like

00:02:58.349 using
00:02:58.590 them
00:02:59.010 if
00:02:59.340 you
00:02:59.489 don't
00:02:59.670 have
00:02:59.849 an

00:02:59.940 immersion
00:03:00.329 blender
00:03:00.360 you
00:03:00.720 use
00:03:00.810 a
00:03:00.950 regular

00:03:01.950 blender
00:03:02.160 but
00:03:02.700 make
00:03:02.880 sure
00:03:03.060 that
00:03:03.180 you
00:03:03.299 only
00:03:03.450 fill

00:03:03.750 it
00:03:03.870 about
00:03:04.200 a
00:03:04.230 third
00:03:04.620 of
00:03:04.829 the
00:03:04.980 way
00:03:05.130 and
00:03:05.400 then

00:03:05.940 cover
00:03:06.209 the
00:03:06.450 top
00:03:06.690 with

00:03:07.890 because
00:03:08.220 liquid
00:03:09.060 expands
00:03:09.720 and
00:03:09.960 it
00:03:10.230 can
00:03:10.410 be

00:03:11.000 the
00:03:12.000 great
00:03:12.150 thing
00:03:12.330 about
00:03:12.360 emerging
00:03:12.870 blender

00:03:13.020 is
00:03:13.230 no
00:03:13.410 splatter
00:03:13.830 basically
00:03:14.790 no
00:03:14.940 mess
00:03:15.270 these

00:03:15.930 kind
00:03:16.320 come
00:03:16.590 apart
00:03:16.950 so
00:03:17.220 they're
00:03:17.370 really
00:03:17.850 alive

00:03:19.880 hmm
00:03:22.610 really
00:03:23.610 sweet
00:03:23.940 from
00:03:24.150 all
00:03:24.270 that
00:03:24.390 roastin

00:03:25.850 so
00:03:26.850 I
00:03:26.880 think
00:03:26.970 it
00:03:27.120 needs
00:03:27.270 a
00:03:27.330 little
00:03:27.360 bit
00:03:27.510 more

00:03:27.750 salt
00:03:27.960 I
00:03:28.260 said
00:03:29.130 I
00:03:29.160 didn't
00:03:29.520 want
00:03:29.640 more
00:03:29.790 pepper

00:03:30.000 but
00:03:30.210 I
00:03:30.240 do
00:03:30.390 want
00:03:30.750 more
00:03:30.870 pepper
00:03:31.110 there's
00:03:31.530 not
00:03:31.710 a

00:03:31.740 lot
00:03:32.070 of
00:03:32.100 seasonings
00:03:32.700 in
00:03:33.000 here
00:03:33.240 so
00:03:33.390 you
00:03:33.480 want
00:03:33.630 to

00:03:33.720 make
00:03:33.870 it
00:03:34.020 really
00:03:34.410 fault
00:03:34.710 flavored
00:03:35.310 with
00:03:35.790 what

00:03:36.000 you
00:03:36.120 have

00:03:36.630 I
00:03:36.660 think
00:03:37.020 sprinkling
00:03:37.470 a
00:03:37.530 little
00:03:37.740 basil
00:03:37.860 over

00:03:38.340 the
00:03:38.460 top
00:03:38.700 at
00:03:38.970 the
00:03:39.150 end
00:03:39.180 as
00:03:39.660 a
00:03:39.720 garnish
00:03:40.230 is
00:03:40.470 nice

00:03:40.650 or
00:03:40.860 you
00:03:40.920 can
00:03:41.070 stir
00:03:41.400 it
00:03:41.520 all
00:03:41.700 in
00:03:41.730 and
00:03:42.180 flavor
