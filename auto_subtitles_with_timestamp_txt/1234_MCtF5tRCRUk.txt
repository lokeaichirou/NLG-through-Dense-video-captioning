00:01:41.159 salt
00:01:41.400 in

00:01:41.610 here
00:01:41.729 will

00:01:45.840 but
00:01:46.049 I
00:01:46.229 don't
00:01:46.350 think

00:01:46.500 purists
00:01:47.040 would
00:01:47.130 be

00:01:48.780 whisk
00:01:48.990 through
00:01:49.259 it
00:01:49.619 should
00:01:50.460 maintain

00:01:50.850 that
00:01:51.570 thickness
00:01:51.899 even
00:01:52.409 when

00:01:55.320 very
00:01:55.649 delicious
00:01:55.950 and
00:01:56.399 simple
00:01:56.670 hollandaise

00:01:58.079 set
00:01:58.259 this
00:01:58.380 aside
00:01:58.530 we
00:01:59.070 now
00:01:59.219 need
00:01:59.399 to
00:01:59.430 talk
00:01:59.670 about

00:01:59.850 our
00:02:00.180 poaching
00:02:00.630 liquid
00:02:01.380 for
00:02:01.740 our
00:02:01.770 eggs
00:02:02.159 I
00:02:02.430 have

00:02:02.610 this
00:02:02.850 come
00:02:03.270 to
00:02:03.540 a
00:02:03.590 rolling
00:02:04.590 simmer
00:02:04.979 and
00:02:05.250 you

00:02:05.490 don't
00:02:05.670 want
00:02:05.790 it
00:02:05.880 to
00:02:05.939 be
00:02:06.060 a
00:02:06.090 really
00:02:06.509 hard
00:02:07.170 boil

00:02:07.680 you
00:02:07.920 want
00:02:08.099 it
00:02:08.190 to
00:02:08.250 be
00:02:08.340 a
00:02:08.369 nice
00:02:08.550 steady
00:02:09.119 simmer

00:02:09.509 keep
00:02:10.140 it
00:02:10.289 on
00:02:10.410 a
00:02:10.440 low
00:02:10.679 temperature
00:02:11.039 we're

00:02:11.340 adding
00:02:11.670 a

00:02:12.300 tablespoon
00:02:12.930 of
00:02:13.290 white
00:02:13.470 wine
00:02:13.650 vinegar
00:02:13.730 now
00:02:14.730 the

00:02:14.790 theory
00:02:15.150 is
00:02:15.360 that
00:02:15.840 a
00:02:16.050 tablespoon
00:02:16.590 of
00:02:16.680 white

00:02:16.770 wine
00:02:16.980 vinegar
00:02:17.010 and
00:02:17.550 the
00:02:18.060 pinch
00:02:18.780 of
00:02:18.960 salt
00:02:19.170 I'm

00:02:19.380 going
00:02:19.500 to
00:02:19.560 add
00:02:19.680 now
00:02:19.980 will
00:02:20.580 make
00:02:20.730 all
00:02:20.970 the

00:02:21.090 difference
00:02:21.420 to
00:02:21.630 bring
00:02:22.050 in
00:02:22.200 your
00:02:22.350 poached
00:02:22.590 eggs

00:02:22.920 together
00:02:23.190 the
00:02:24.180 wet
00:02:24.390 that
00:02:24.630 I
00:02:24.780 use
00:02:25.080 is
00:02:25.410 slightly

00:02:26.040 different
00:02:26.310 because
00:02:26.820 normally
00:02:27.240 everyone
00:02:27.450 goes

00:02:27.630 in
00:02:27.780 there
00:02:27.960 and
00:02:28.110 swirls
00:02:28.530 it
00:02:28.680 around

00:02:29.070 I'm
00:02:29.190 just
00:02:29.490 swirling
00:02:29.670 it
00:02:29.850 very
00:02:30.090 gently
00:02:30.510 to

00:02:30.720 dissolve
00:02:31.020 the
00:02:31.230 salt
00:02:31.410 but
00:02:32.250 I
00:02:32.280 don't
00:02:32.610 actually

00:02:32.700 swirl
00:02:33.120 my
00:02:33.360 water
00:02:33.540 I
00:02:33.750 just
00:02:33.990 pop
00:02:34.230 my
00:02:34.470 egg
00:02:34.620 in
00:02:34.830 very

00:02:35.100 gently
00:02:35.400 because
00:02:35.760 it
00:02:36.000 is
00:02:36.150 poached

00:02:37.320 not
00:02:37.500 everyone
00:02:37.860 gets

00:02:39.300 my
00:02:39.450 little
00:02:39.630 trick
00:02:39.900 and
00:02:40.110 it's
00:02:40.230 the

00:02:40.350 way
00:02:40.470 I
00:02:40.710 always
00:02:41.100 make
00:02:41.460 my
00:02:41.490 poached
00:02:41.850 eggs
00:02:42.090 it's

00:02:42.330 always

00:02:42.750 very
00:02:42.870 simple
00:02:43.440 one
00:02:43.500 and
00:02:43.740 even
00:02:44.070 if

00:02:45.540 this
00:02:46.260 method
00:02:46.680 I

00:02:46.890 hope
00:02:47.310 I
00:02:47.460 can
00:02:47.610 guarantee

00:02:48.870 so
00:02:49.110 in

00:02:59.700 and
00:03:00.200 there
00:03:01.200 is
00:03:01.290 a
00:03:01.350 tendency
00:03:01.620 when
00:03:01.860 they
00:03:01.980 come
