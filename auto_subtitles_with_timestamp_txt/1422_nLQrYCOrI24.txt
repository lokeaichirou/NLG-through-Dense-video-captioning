00:01:23.030 soft
00:01:23.600 it

00:01:24.590 take
00:01:24.890 an
00:01:25.130 hour
00:01:25.280 an
00:01:25.670 hour

00:04:00.380 more
00:04:00.620 water
00:04:00.830 that's
00:04:01.550 why

00:04:01.700 it's
00:04:01.850 important
00:04:02.330 to

00:04:43.680 of
00:04:44.220 my
00:04:44.490 square
00:04:44.880 closing
00:04:45.480 the

00:04:45.600 corners
00:04:46.050 to
00:04:46.260 create
00:04:46.440 like
00:04:46.890 a
00:04:46.920 kind
00:04:47.460 of

00:04:47.610 triangle

00:04:52.680 little

00:04:52.940 ring
00:04:53.940 but
00:04:54.540 it

00:04:54.990 an
00:04:55.260 ear

00:05:05.220 on
00:05:05.370 the
00:05:05.460 table
00:05:05.640 because
00:05:06.090 it's
00:05:06.420 closing

00:05:06.690 better
00:05:07.110 if

00:05:15.900 wet
00:05:16.140 the
00:05:16.380 dough
00:05:16.560 and

00:05:17.040 then

00:05:24.390 water

00:05:26.900 the
00:05:27.080 important
00:05:27.650 part

00:05:28.880 you
00:05:29.030 don't

00:05:29.419 overcrowd

00:05:43.220 you
00:05:43.580 want
00:05:43.880 to
00:05:44.060 point
00:05:44.300 them

00:05:49.840 nonstick
00:05:50.840 spray

00:05:51.250 just
00:05:52.250 so
00:05:52.460 they
00:05:52.610 don't
00:05:52.820 stick
00:05:53.120 together
00:05:53.300 and

00:05:53.810 then
