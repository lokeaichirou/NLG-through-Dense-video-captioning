00:05:09.639 I'm
00:05:09.729 going
00:05:09.969 this

00:05:10.089 way
00:05:10.149 just
00:05:11.080 microwave

00:05:14.589 like
00:05:14.889 5
00:05:15.189 minutes
00:05:15.460 I
00:05:15.669 would
00:05:15.849 say

00:05:15.879 and
00:05:16.689 it's
00:05:17.050 going
00:05:17.229 to
00:05:17.319 take
00:05:17.589 more
00:05:18.430 5-10
00:05:19.330 minutes

00:05:19.629 I
00:05:19.779 would
00:05:19.990 say
00:05:20.069 so
00:05:21.069 we
00:05:21.219 want
00:05:21.550 really
00:05:22.270 our

00:05:23.319 get
00:05:23.499 cooked
00:05:23.800 well
00:05:24.099 so
00:05:24.819 that's

00:05:25.029 reason
00:05:25.270 it's
00:05:25.629 going
00:05:26.020 to
00:05:26.110 take
00:05:26.289 time
00:05:26.559 because

00:05:26.740 the
00:05:27.189 recipe
00:05:27.399 secret
00:05:28.029 again
00:05:28.479 is
00:05:29.370 tomatoes

00:05:30.370 should
00:05:30.639 not
00:05:31.330 be
00:05:31.680 undercooked
00:05:32.680 it
00:05:32.830 should
00:05:33.009 we

00:05:33.129 all
00:05:33.339 cope
00:05:33.969 well
00:05:34.330 say
00:05:35.020 so
00:05:35.729 look
00:05:36.729 at
00:05:36.879 the
00:05:37.059 masala

00:05:38.550 instead
00:05:39.550 of
00:05:39.669 looking
00:05:39.999 like
00:05:40.240 a

00:05:41.259 started

00:05:41.560 leaving
00:05:41.919 oil
00:05:42.310 so
00:05:42.699 that
00:05:42.879 means
00:05:43.149 it's
00:05:43.389 done
00:05:43.689 at

00:05:43.959 this
00:05:44.199 point
00:05:44.439 of
00:05:44.560 time

00:05:49.120 water
00:05:49.389 in
00:05:49.569 this
