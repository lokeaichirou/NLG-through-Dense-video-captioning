00:04:26.180 an
00:04:26.330 expression
00:04:26.870 for
00:04:27.080 showing

00:04:27.470 off
00:04:27.620 the
00:04:27.800 bit
00:04:28.150 because
00:04:29.470 eggs
00:04:30.470 as
00:04:31.250 a
00:04:31.280 protein

00:04:32.060 worked
00:04:32.510 they're
00:04:33.380 certainly
00:04:33.680 going
00:04:33.860 to
00:04:33.950 rare

00:04:34.220 commodity
00:04:34.820 but
00:04:35.000 you
00:04:35.180 wouldn't
00:04:35.590 you
00:04:36.590 know
00:04:36.710 you

00:04:36.740 wouldn't
00:04:36.890 be
00:04:37.100 throwing
00:04:37.520 eggs
00:04:37.669 into
00:04:38.090 things

00:04:38.300 willy
00:04:38.600 nearly
00:04:39.020 either
00:04:39.229 you
00:04:39.620 know
00:04:39.740 they
00:04:40.010 were
00:04:40.070 a

00:04:40.190 source
00:04:40.490 of
00:04:40.640 protein
00:04:40.910 and
00:04:41.150 they
00:04:41.390 were
00:04:41.450 a

00:04:41.540 serious
00:04:42.050 food
00:04:43.180 so
00:04:44.180 you'd
00:04:44.360 be
00:04:44.479 careful
00:04:44.960 about

00:04:45.110 how
00:04:45.290 many
00:04:45.500 eggs
00:04:45.680 you

00:04:46.669 and

00:04:46.940 you
00:04:47.060 put
00:04:47.300 the
00:04:47.540 majority
00:04:48.110 of
00:04:48.140 your
00:04:48.290 eggs

00:04:48.680 into
00:04:48.950 a
00:04:49.040 rich
00:04:49.220 cake
00:04:49.520 a
00:04:49.550 Christmas
00:04:50.060 cake

00:04:52.160 we
00:04:52.640 don't
00:04:52.760 have
00:04:52.880 to

00:04:57.440 of

00:04:57.530 poverty
00:04:57.919 now
00:04:58.220 but
