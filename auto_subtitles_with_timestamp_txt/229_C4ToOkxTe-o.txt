00:00:45.270 figure
00:00:45.510 this
00:00:45.600 out

00:00:46.820 and
00:00:47.820 I
00:00:47.910 don't
00:00:48.090 know
00:00:48.180 if

00:00:50.579 cut
00:00:50.789 online
00:00:51.210 or

00:00:51.480 what
00:00:51.719 because
00:00:52.440 it
00:00:52.710 actually
00:00:52.920 came
00:00:53.250 with

00:00:53.309 cookware
00:00:53.850 that
00:00:53.910 we
00:00:54.180 bought
00:00:54.390 like
00:00:54.629 four
00:00:55.289 or

00:00:55.440 five
00:00:55.469 years
00:00:55.620 ago
00:00:56.160 so
00:00:56.910 I
00:00:56.940 haven't
00:00:57.420 tried

00:00:57.570 looking
00:00:58.050 or
00:00:58.379 I
00:00:58.410 don't
00:00:58.710 know
00:00:58.829 but
00:00:59.550 otherwise
00:00:59.910 a

00:01:00.059 good
00:01:00.480 tool
00:01:00.780 is
00:01:01.140 a
00:01:01.170 cheese
00:01:01.680 grater
00:01:01.710 I
00:01:02.370 read

00:01:02.789 online
00:01:02.969 that
00:01:03.180 a
00:01:03.420 course
00:01:03.750 cheese
00:01:04.080 grater
00:01:04.410 can

00:01:04.920 actually
00:01:05.220 get

00:01:06.539 out
00:01:06.720 of

00:01:09.899 vegan
00:01:10.110 and

00:01:10.590 you

00:01:10.979 cheese
00:01:11.190 grater
00:01:11.690 that

00:01:12.690 would
00:01:12.780 probably
00:01:13.229 make
00:01:13.380 sense
