00:05:10.970 was
00:05:11.060 really
00:05:11.330 inspired
00:05:11.810 by
00:05:11.990 my

00:05:12.200 last
00:05:12.380 trip
00:05:12.680 to

00:05:15.260 this
00:05:15.380 gorgeous

00:05:15.920 big
00:05:16.220 sourdough
00:05:16.790 bread
00:05:17.060 bowl

00:05:17.570 was

00:05:17.780 incredible
00:05:18.440 I
00:05:18.680 thought
00:05:19.460 it
00:05:19.520 was
00:05:19.640 a
00:05:19.670 little
00:05:19.820 too

00:05:20.000 heavy
00:05:20.270 so
00:05:20.600 I'm
00:05:20.720 not
00:05:20.870 serving
00:05:21.470 in
00:05:21.620 a
00:05:21.650 bread
00:05:21.980 bowl

00:05:22.010 but
00:05:22.370 you
00:05:22.460 absolutely
00:05:22.670 can
00:05:23.480 but
00:05:24.170 this
00:05:24.380 was
