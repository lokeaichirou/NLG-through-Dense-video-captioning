00:03:39.440 a
00:03:39.470 little
00:03:39.680 messy

00:03:46.940 get
00:03:47.090 this
00:03:47.270 on
00:03:47.510 and
00:03:48.050 it's
00:03:48.260 not
00:03:48.320 going

00:03:48.440 to
00:03:48.680 take
00:03:48.860 very
00:03:48.890 long
00:03:49.340 to

00:03:58.310 awesome
00:03:58.880 I
00:03:59.800 think
00:04:00.800 my

00:04:00.920 stomach
00:04:01.370 is
00:04:01.490 rumbling
00:04:01.990 now
00:04:02.990 you
00:04:03.050 want
00:04:03.290 to

00:04:03.470 sure
00:04:03.500 you
00:04:03.830 throw

00:04:05.150 after

00:04:05.540 you're
00:04:05.690 done
00:04:05.810 you
00:04:05.990 don't
00:04:06.170 want
00:04:06.320 to
00:04:06.410 keep
00:04:06.560 that

00:04:06.830 I'm
00:04:07.640 going
00:04:07.760 to
00:04:07.790 go
00:04:07.910 ahead
00:04:07.970 and
00:04:08.150 close
00:04:08.270 the
00:04:08.540 lid

00:04:09.160 and
00:04:10.160 check
00:04:10.190 this
00:04:10.640 in
00:04:10.820 just
00:04:10.940 a
00:04:11.090 couple
00:04:11.270 of

00:04:11.450 minutes
00:04:11.570 it's
00:04:11.870 not
00:04:11.990 going
00:04:12.140 to
00:04:12.200 take
00:04:12.320 very
00:04:12.470 long

00:04:12.530 at
00:04:12.800 all
00:04:12.890 okay
00:04:13.850 so
00:04:13.910 we're
00:04:14.090 gonna
00:04:14.180 have
00:04:14.300 a
00:04:14.330 look

00:04:14.480 at
00:04:14.600 this
00:04:15.970 we
00:04:16.970 don't
00:04:17.120 want
00:04:17.330 to
00:04:17.390 overcook
00:04:17.810 it
00:04:18.020 oh

00:04:19.960 look
00:04:20.960 at
00:04:21.049 that

00:04:21.940 nice
00:04:22.600 grill
00:04:22.960 marks
00:04:24.690 after
00:04:25.690 we
00:04:25.780 cut
00:04:26.020 this
00:04:26.170 up

00:04:26.410 we're
00:04:26.590 probably
00:04:26.800 going
00:04:27.130 to
00:04:27.190 heat
00:04:27.850 it
00:04:28.000 again
00:04:28.090 at

00:04:28.570 least
00:04:28.720 that's
00:04:28.900 what
00:04:28.960 Bruce
00:04:29.770 tells
00:04:30.040 me
00:04:30.190 we're

00:04:30.310 going
00:04:30.340 to
00:04:30.490 heat
00:04:30.580 it
00:04:30.610 up
00:04:30.730 a
00:04:30.850 little
00:04:31.030 bit
00:04:31.210 more
00:04:31.540 in

00:04:31.900 the
00:04:32.740 microwave
00:04:33.220 because
00:04:33.370 it's
00:04:33.850 going
00:04:34.030 to
00:04:34.090 cool

00:04:34.330 off
00:04:34.540 as
00:04:34.750 we
00:04:34.870 cut
00:04:35.110 it
00:04:35.230 up
00:04:36.060 smells
00:04:37.060 incredible

00:04:38.100 nice
00:04:39.100 and
00:04:39.340 tender
00:04:39.580 ok
00:04:40.090 another
00:04:40.270 minute
00:04:40.600 on

00:04:40.660 that
00:04:40.720 side
00:04:41.080 we'll
00:04:41.230 take
00:04:41.470 it
00:04:41.590 off
00:04:44.850 all
00:04:45.850 right
00:04:46.090 so

00:04:46.330 now
00:04:46.480 I
00:04:46.510 think
00:04:46.720 we're
00:04:47.020 ready
00:04:47.200 to
00:04:47.440 take
00:04:47.680 the
00:04:47.830 meat

00:04:47.980 off
00:04:49.620 and
00:04:51.210 it
00:04:52.210 looks
00:04:52.420 pretty
00:04:52.660 good
00:04:53.100 nice
00:04:54.100 grill

00:04:54.400 marks
00:04:54.850 I
00:04:56.340 move
00:04:57.340 these
00:04:57.490 over
00:04:57.550 to
00:04:57.880 the
00:04:57.940 side

00:04:58.210 because
00:04:58.450 they
00:04:58.720 were
00:04:59.050 done
00:04:59.230 first
00:05:00.630 now
00:05:01.630 this

00:05:01.780 one
00:05:01.960 here
00:05:02.110 is
00:05:02.230 still
00:05:02.350 just
00:05:02.710 a
00:05:02.860 little
00:05:02.890 bit
00:05:03.250 more

00:05:04.060 rare
00:05:04.330 than
00:05:04.360 the
00:05:04.600 others
00:05:05.010 but
00:05:06.010 we'll
00:05:06.580 probably

00:05:06.790 be
00:05:07.090 heating
00:05:07.390 it
00:05:07.480 up
00:05:07.570 a
00:05:07.690 little
00:05:07.810 bit
00:05:07.990 in
00:05:08.170 the
00:05:08.290 in

00:05:08.470 the
00:05:08.710 microwave
00:05:09.220 so
00:05:09.490 we're
00:05:09.610 going
00:05:09.730 to
00:05:09.790 take

00:05:09.910 those
00:05:10.060 off
00:05:10.300 take
00:05:10.570 them
00:05:10.720 in
00:05:10.870 and
00:05:11.170 then
00:05:11.410 cut
00:05:12.160 it

00:05:12.190 up
00:05:12.370 and
00:05:12.550 serve
00:05:12.700 it
00:05:12.840 alright
00:05:13.840 so
00:05:13.960 now
00:05:14.110 we're

00:05:14.320 ready
00:05:14.530 to
00:05:14.770 cut
00:05:14.980 up
00:05:15.100 our
00:05:15.250 meat
00:05:15.490 into
00:05:16.230 thumbnail

00:05:17.230 sized
00:05:17.680 pieces
00:05:18.510 so
00:05:19.510 we'll
00:05:19.690 make
00:05:19.840 strips
00:05:20.230 like

00:05:20.410 this
00:05:20.620 you
00:05:20.770 can
00:05:20.890 see
00:05:21.040 it's
00:05:21.160 still
00:05:21.340 a
00:05:21.400 little
00:05:21.580 bit

00:05:21.700 rare
00:05:22.090 but
00:05:22.480 it's
00:05:22.720 going
00:05:22.900 to
00:05:22.960 go
00:05:23.110 into
00:05:23.500 the

00:05:23.590 microwave
00:05:24.180 that'll
00:05:25.180 cook
00:05:25.330 it
00:05:25.480 up
00:05:25.570 a
00:05:25.660 little

00:05:25.750 bit
00:05:25.960 more
00:05:26.140 only
00:05:26.380 because
00:05:26.800 by

00:05:30.970 off
00:05:31.150 and
00:05:31.480 we
00:05:31.840 can't
00:05:32.380 have
00:05:32.620 cold
