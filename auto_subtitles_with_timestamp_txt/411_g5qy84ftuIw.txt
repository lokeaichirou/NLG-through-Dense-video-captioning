00:04:35.490 want
00:04:36.030 jazzy
00:04:36.240 cells
00:04:36.570 and
00:04:37.530 goes
00:04:37.920 the

00:04:38.310 parsley
00:04:39.200 Kate
00:04:40.200 we're
00:04:40.350 almost
00:04:40.470 done
00:04:40.800 this

00:04:41.070 recipe
00:04:41.400 is
00:04:41.460 very
00:04:41.490 simple
00:04:41.790 it
00:04:42.270 is
00:04:42.390 simple
00:04:43.280 lemon

00:04:44.280 a
00:04:44.640 little
00:04:45.270 bit
00:04:45.480 of
00:04:45.540 zest
00:04:45.690 a
00:04:46.230 little
00:04:46.350 bit
00:04:46.560 of
00:04:46.650 the

00:04:46.770 juice
00:04:47.390 lemon
00:04:48.390 also
00:04:48.690 helps
00:04:48.990 to
00:04:49.140 raise
00:04:49.290 your
00:04:49.590 pH

00:04:49.830 so
00:04:50.310 it's
00:04:50.460 more
00:04:50.640 alkaline
00:04:51.090 instead
00:04:51.600 of
00:04:51.690 acidic

00:04:52.200 and
00:04:52.410 you
00:04:52.500 want
00:04:52.740 that
00:04:52.860 because
00:04:52.920 your
00:04:53.280 body

00:04:53.460 operates
00:04:54.000 a
00:04:54.120 lot
00:04:54.270 better
00:04:54.510 when
00:04:54.720 it's
00:04:54.870 alkaline

00:04:58.070 that's
00:04:59.070 just
00:04:59.280 shooting
00:04:59.670 everywhere
00:05:00.060 love
00:05:00.540 it

00:05:04.940 good
00:05:05.940 bicep
00:05:06.510 -
00:05:06.690 somehow
00:05:07.230 I
00:05:07.260 find
00:05:07.620 that
00:05:07.770 easier

00:05:08.160 than
00:05:08.310 just
00:05:08.490 squeezing
00:05:08.880 it
00:05:08.940 with
00:05:09.090 my
00:05:09.210 bare

00:05:09.390 hands
00:05:09.710 okay
00:05:10.710 lemon
00:05:11.070 zest
00:05:11.460 lemon
00:05:12.000 juice
00:05:12.420 a

00:05:12.720 couple
00:05:13.620 tablespoons
00:05:14.100 of
00:05:14.340 olive
00:05:14.490 oil
00:05:14.880 mm-hmm

00:05:17.450 sea
00:05:18.450 salt
00:05:20.900 freshly
00:05:21.900 ground
00:05:22.110 black
00:05:22.860 pepper

00:05:23.550 yeah

00:05:28.830 better
00:05:28.980 I
