00:00:03.290 and
00:00:04.290 it's
00:00:04.799 so
00:00:05.009 interesting
00:00:05.400 that
00:00:05.609 it's
00:00:05.879 all

00:00:06.060 the
00:00:06.600 trend
00:00:06.899 today
00:00:07.080 and
00:00:07.710 when
00:00:07.919 I
00:00:07.950 was
00:00:08.220 a
00:00:08.250 kid
00:00:08.610 and

00:00:08.940 my
00:00:08.970 mom
00:00:09.599 would
00:00:10.139 take
00:00:10.349 hummus
00:00:10.830 and
00:00:11.219 use
00:00:11.849 that

00:00:12.059 instead
00:00:12.360 of
00:00:12.420 Mayo
00:00:12.690 on
00:00:13.019 our
00:00:13.170 sandwiches
00:00:13.740 and
00:00:13.889 we

00:00:13.920 packed
00:00:14.340 those
00:00:14.610 in
00:00:14.849 our
00:00:15.299 brown
00:00:15.599 bag
00:00:15.839 for
00:00:16.170 lunch

00:00:16.350 and
00:00:16.529 the
00:00:16.650 other
00:00:16.800 kids
00:00:17.160 would
00:00:17.670 ask
00:00:17.850 me
00:00:18.090 what
00:00:18.270 I

00:00:18.300 was
00:00:18.600 eating
00:00:18.810 because
00:00:19.140 it
00:00:19.260 smelled
00:00:19.590 so
00:00:19.740 great

00:00:20.279 I'd
00:00:20.609 be
00:00:20.850 real
00:00:21.060 embarrassed
00:00:21.600 and
00:00:21.750 I'd
00:00:21.869 say

00:00:22.050 Lebanese
00:00:22.560 mayonnaise
00:00:23.130 but
00:00:23.670 you
00:00:23.789 know
00:00:23.939 what
00:00:24.619 we

00:00:25.619 have
00:00:25.800 really
00:00:26.189 come
00:00:26.400 full
00:00:26.640 circle
00:00:26.699 hummus
00:00:27.570 is

00:00:27.720 probably
00:00:28.349 one
00:00:28.769 of
00:00:28.800 the
00:00:28.949 best
00:00:29.130 things
00:00:29.400 you
00:00:29.490 can

00:00:29.699 eat
00:00:29.849 and
00:00:30.090 it's
00:00:30.599 very
00:00:30.869 expensive
00:00:31.560 in
00:00:31.650 the
00:00:31.800 delis

00:00:32.219 or
00:00:32.399 at
00:00:32.489 the
00:00:32.610 grocery
00:00:32.730 I'm
00:00:33.180 going
00:00:33.329 to
00:00:33.390 show
00:00:33.540 you

00:00:33.570 how
00:00:33.780 to
00:00:33.840 make
00:00:34.050 your
00:00:34.230 own
00:00:34.440 an
00:00:34.649 old
00:00:35.160 family

00:00:35.399 recipe
00:00:35.610 that's
00:00:36.210 delicious
00:00:36.719 and
00:00:36.930 really
00:00:37.110 easy

00:00:37.559 you
00:00:37.829 want
00:00:38.250 to
00:00:38.340 start
00:00:38.579 off
00:00:38.730 with
00:00:38.760 the
00:00:39.030 can
00:00:39.239 of

00:00:39.390 chickpeas
00:00:39.739 sometimes
00:00:40.739 called
00:00:41.010 chichi
00:00:41.460 beans

00:00:41.640 garbanzo
00:00:42.000 beans
00:00:42.829 full

00:00:43.980 calcium
00:00:44.219 any
00:00:44.730 bean

00:00:45.000 is
00:00:45.180 really
00:00:45.510 good
00:00:45.690 helps
00:00:45.989 pull
00:00:46.260 cholesterol

00:00:46.890 out
00:00:46.950 of
00:00:47.100 your

00:00:47.460 all
00:00:47.940 I
00:00:48.000 do
00:00:48.300 is
00:00:48.539 drain
00:00:48.809 them

00:00:49.050 you
00:00:49.140 don't
00:00:49.320 need
00:00:49.620 to
00:00:49.770 rinse
00:00:49.950 them
00:00:50.219 now
00:00:50.730 you
00:00:50.789 can

00:00:50.940 do
00:00:51.210 this
00:00:51.360 by
00:00:51.570 hand
00:00:51.870 like
00:00:52.170 my
00:00:52.379 mom
00:00:52.590 used
00:00:52.620 to
00:00:52.920 do

00:00:53.129 but
00:00:54.120 I'm
00:00:54.210 going
00:00:54.449 to
00:00:54.510 do

00:00:57.090 it
00:00:57.239 very
00:00:57.420 smooth

00:00:57.930 but
00:00:58.199 you
00:00:58.320 can
00:00:58.500 get
00:00:58.680 smoother
00:00:59.430 as
00:00:59.550 chunky
00:00:59.820 as

00:00:59.969 you

00:01:07.439 smells
00:01:07.710 so
00:01:07.770 good

00:01:08.340 more
00:01:08.610 or
00:01:08.760 less
00:01:08.790 remember
00:01:09.510 this
00:01:09.630 is
00:01:09.810 to
00:01:09.930 your

00:01:10.080 taste
00:01:10.110 now
00:01:10.619 garlic

00:02:18.420 cellular
00:02:18.930 structure

00:02:19.410 down
00:02:19.620 if
00:02:19.950 it's
00:02:20.400 still
00:02:20.670 real
00:02:20.880 hard
00:02:21.120 sometimes

00:02:21.570 that
00:02:21.780 doesn't
00:02:21.990 work
00:02:22.290 well
00:02:22.500 what
00:02:22.650 you

00:02:30.450 few
00:02:30.840 seconds
00:02:31.350 not
00:02:31.560 long
00:02:31.920 and

00:02:32.280 what
00:02:33.120 happens
00:02:33.540 is
00:02:33.780 the
00:02:34.260 heat
00:02:34.470 of

00:02:35.520 again
00:02:35.970 soften
00:02:36.870 the
