00:01:12.650 the

00:01:41.729 make
00:01:41.880 like
00:01:41.909 a
00:01:42.500 I

00:01:43.500 don't
00:01:44.280 know
00:01:44.460 like
00:01:44.670 a
00:01:44.729 it's
00:01:45.240 healthy
00:01:45.810 it's
00:01:46.259 a

00:01:46.350 wrap
00:01:46.790 that's
00:01:47.790 a

00:01:48.060 you
00:01:48.720 know
00:01:49.680 what
00:01:49.770 I
00:01:49.799 mean

00:01:50.149 anyway
00:01:51.149 you
00:01:51.270 can
00:01:51.390 do
00:01:51.479 lots
00:01:51.630 with
00:01:51.810 them
00:01:51.899 and

00:01:52.290 good
00:01:52.560 cold
00:01:53.130 the
00:01:53.340 next
00:01:53.610 day
00:01:53.820 so

00:01:54.240 it's
00:01:54.869 one
00:01:55.020 of
00:01:55.049 them
00:01:55.229 become
00:01:55.740 like
00:01:56.009 one
00:01:56.040 of
00:01:56.219 my

00:01:56.490 go-to
00:01:57.320 recipes
00:01:58.320 now
00:01:59.090 then
00:02:00.090 I've
00:02:00.180 got
00:02:00.329 some

00:02:00.360 grated
00:02:00.869 carrot
00:02:01.320 and
00:02:01.500 I
00:02:01.590 graded
00:02:01.890 this
00:02:02.100 on
00:02:02.310 a

00:02:02.549 microplane
00:02:03.060 so
00:02:03.479 it's
00:02:03.659 like
00:02:03.840 super
00:02:04.590 finely

00:02:05.250 grated
00:02:06.500 I've
00:02:07.500 also
00:02:07.680 done
00:02:07.950 this
00:02:08.129 recipe
00:02:08.670 using

00:02:09.060 grated
00:02:09.539 sweet
00:02:09.750 potato
00:02:10.080 I
00:02:10.410 like
00:02:11.310 the
00:02:11.550 fine

00:02:13.330 greater
00:02:13.750 just
00:02:14.290 because
00:02:14.830 it
00:02:14.950 gives
00:02:15.040 the

00:02:15.280 finished
00:02:15.610 meatballs
00:02:16.000 a
00:02:16.210 more
00:02:16.480 delicate

00:02:16.810 texture
00:02:17.500 but
00:02:17.770 you
00:02:18.340 could
00:02:18.490 probably
00:02:18.670 use
00:02:19.030 the

00:02:19.330 regular
00:02:19.660 cheese
00:02:20.320 grater
00:02:20.590 probably
00:02:21.580 probably

00:02:22.150 I've
00:02:22.570 never
00:02:22.750 tried
00:02:22.960 it

00:02:23.260 salt
00:02:23.650 and
00:02:24.460 sometimes
00:02:25.390 I'll
00:02:25.540 also
00:02:25.690 add
00:02:25.960 a

00:02:26.500 couple
00:02:27.010 tablespoons
00:02:27.310 of
00:02:27.520 Parmesan
00:02:27.970 cheese
00:02:28.000 to

00:02:28.180 the
00:02:28.450 same
00:02:28.660 mixture
00:02:28.960 if
00:02:29.200 I'm
00:02:29.350 doing
00:02:29.680 like
00:02:30.040 a

00:02:30.100 Italian
00:02:30.910 style
00:02:32.010 mixer
00:02:33.010 Rooney
00:02:33.810 and
00:02:34.810 pepper

00:02:35.020 look
00:02:35.320 guys
00:02:35.470 I
00:02:35.620 finally
00:02:35.740 got
00:02:36.040 a
00:02:36.280 pepper
00:02:36.520 grinder

00:02:36.910 so
00:02:37.150 I
00:02:37.210 don't
00:02:37.360 have
00:02:37.510 to
00:02:37.630 like
00:02:37.810 grind
00:02:38.020 it
00:02:38.170 by
00:02:38.290 hand

00:02:38.590 like
00:02:39.100 the
00:02:39.760 Paleolithic
00:02:40.690 era
00:02:40.930 or
00:02:41.290 something

00:02:42.270 there
00:02:43.270 she
00:02:43.420 proud
00:02:43.840 of
00:02:44.020 me
00:02:44.140 okay
00:02:45.690 okay
00:02:46.690 so
00:02:46.750 once

00:02:47.050 this
00:02:47.140 is
00:02:47.320 mixed
00:02:47.650 up
00:02:47.770 well
00:02:47.980 I've
00:02:48.250 got
00:02:48.550 a
00:02:48.760 baking

00:02:49.180 sheet
00:02:49.600 here
00:02:49.770 that
00:02:50.770 I've
00:02:50.860 just
00:02:50.980 lined
00:02:51.250 with

00:02:51.580 some
00:02:51.790 parchment
00:02:51.850 paper
00:02:52.360 and
00:02:52.600 I'm
00:02:52.660 gonna
00:02:52.840 use

00:02:52.990 my
00:02:53.200 little
00:02:53.410 cookie
00:02:54.070 scoop
00:02:54.460 just
00:02:55.060 to
00:02:55.210 portion

00:02:55.600 it
00:02:55.720 out
00:02:55.840 you
00:02:56.470 could
00:02:56.650 roll
00:02:56.920 it
00:02:57.070 by
00:02:57.160 hand
00:02:57.430 but

00:02:57.700 this
00:02:57.820 is
00:02:57.970 way
00:02:58.240 faster
00:02:58.510 and
00:02:58.780 like
00:02:59.320 really
00:03:00.220 in

00:03:00.400 the
00:03:00.490 grand
00:03:00.760 scheme
00:03:00.910 of
00:03:01.060 things
00:03:01.180 who
00:03:01.720 wants
00:03:01.960 to

00:03:02.080 spend
00:03:02.380 time
00:03:02.640 making
00:03:03.640 sure
00:03:03.760 that
00:03:04.120 their

00:03:04.240 meatballs
